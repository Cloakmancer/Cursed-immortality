Chapter 291 I Will Relieve You
﻿Under Jacob's eyes, two dry corpses like men walked toward him and looked extremely sick, like they were on the verge of collapsing.Jacob looked at the hobgoblin and fox-face orc without much surprise since he already knew there were two men present in this place, and they were both dying."Who is Great Earth Minor between you two?" Jacob questioned.Mason opened his mouth, but no words came out, and he started coughing violently.Lucas spoke in his dry, raspy voice, "Cut the crap and tell us how to treat this disease *cough*…" He also started coughing the next moment.Jacob found the pair quite amusing as they were clearly on the verge of dying, yet they were still moving around and acting all high and mighty.Still, he was not here to get amused, so he stated his condition, "I want all that silver metal you had as well as the location where you found it. Only after then will I relieve you from your current situation."Mason was finally able to control his coughing as there was clear blood on his lips, and his condition was turning worse the more he remained outside the healing liquid cell. So, he also didn't have the energy to negotiate with Jacob.He hoarsely replied, "G-give… give us the cure, and I'll give you all the mineral on me. As for the location where I found it, I have to disappoint you, *cough*, because I… I took it all!"Jacob looked deeply at the hobgoblin, who seemed to be sincere beyond belief, and scoffed, "It seemed you still cherish wealth over your life. So, you can take it to your grave then."Jacob turned around, which shocked the two men, and before they could speak, something unimaginable happened.Jacob, through a casual punch and the reinforced door, which was made even to block E-tier-6 physical attacks, blasted back like it was made out of a thin sheet of wood.Lucas almost had a heart attack and nearly choked on his own blood when he saw his pride and joy. The lab he was absolutely confident in being impenetrable in the entire rare plains was nothing but a toy house in front of this mysterious man.Mason was also stunned silly as he looked at Jacob, who was walking toward the staircase without even looking at them anymore.He never thought that the person he wanted to threaten was strong beyond his expectation. The notion came into his mind that Lucas had been tricked with all those guarantees and wanted to drag him down to hell with himself.But Lucas's reaction told him otherwise.Nevertheless, it wasn't time to mull over their mistakes, as Mason was now really afraid of dying. No, he was going to die if he remained stubborn.So, he quickly called out, "W-wait!"Jacob halted his footsteps and looked behind before he said, "I'll give you one last chance. Give me all that mineral on you as well as tell me the exact location where you found it. If there's even a little bit of falsehood in your words, I'll know, and this time I won't stop."And don't even think that all those explosives hidden in this base, especially the one you two are hiding right behind the south wall, which is made with the same material, can threaten him."That product is only half-baked, and it won't even blow up a chicken. If you don't believe me, you can try, and let's see what happens."Jacob's casual words made the two guys' expressions warp, and with an appalled looked, they looked at each other. There were clear shock, disbelief, and terror in their eyes.Especially Lucas. He almost thought that Jacob had an x-ray vision or had some high-grade scanner or Jacob somehow deactivated the anti-barrier of this hideout. Nevertheless, whatever the case was, the cats were now out of the bag, and the man seemed to be not afraid despite knowing what was hidden in this place. They might've tried calling Jacob's bluff, but after seeing him punching the reinforced door like he was breaking a twig, none of them were confident anymore.Mason was instantly broken since he no longer found Lucas reliable, and he still thinks that he was in this mess because of Lucas and his experiments. He was in constant pain as even breathing made him feel worse than living, and he was already on the verge of a mental breakdown. He was too afraid of dying, and when despaired filled his heart. "I-I agree!" Mason blurted before he showed the ring on his pinky and to Jacob, "I have over fifty kg of that mineral right in this space ring. The location coordinates where I found it is also recorded in my map scanner. You can take them all. Just give me the cure!""Y-you fool! Didn't you say you hid the map scanner with coordinates before coming here?! What if he took it and killed us?!" Lucas wanted to roar, but he could only not.However, the terror in his eyes was clear. Because he knew they couldn't threaten Jacob anymore with the explosives hidden in the base. So, those coordinates were the only bargaining chip they had over Jacob.If it were him, he would've offered Jacob the mineral first and only after Jacob handed him over the cure. Maybe then he might've given him the real location or even a fake one to lead him in circles.But alas, the muscle-brain greedy hobgoblin was not as treacherous nor tenacious as the fox orc and broke under the pain and despair of death."Shut up! We are in this state because of you greedy *cough…" g-greedy ass!" Mason berated with a twisted expression. Jacob's lips curled up under his mask, "Alright, empty your space ring right here, and as long as the goods are here, I will relieve you of your suffering.""S-see? He didn't *cough* didn't make a move, or he could've simply killed us and taken my ring. And this time, I wasn't lying!" Mason disdainfully retorted.Lucas also felt it made sense, but he still felt they had lost all leverage.Mason no longer cared about Lucas's feelings or what he thought. He just wanted to be relieved from this pain. So, without hesitation, Mason moved his hand and started to take out everything in his space ring.When Jacob saw all those minerals, especially the large boulder of plutonium, his eyes lit up, and he also noticed other things, as well as the black map scanner. He knew Mason was not playing tricks anymore."It's empty! Now give me the cure!" Mason madly declared."I believe you." Jacob nodded, giving Mason hope.But the next moment, Mason's hope for getting all of this turned into sudden despair when Jacob's finger vanished from his sight and appeared right in front of his face while his hand was moved like a knife and directly penetrated into his heart.   Jacob's devilish voice rang, "Let me relieve you of your suffering!"

Chapter 292 Maybe It’s Time…
﻿Lucas fell on his butt when he saw Mason's lumpy body hanging over Jacob's bloody hand, which was coming slightly out of his chest. Mason's heart was clutched within Jacob's hand, and it was pulsing weakly.'Squish…'Jacob crushed the heart like a bug before his hand retracted, and Mason's corpse fell to the floor with a large bloody hole in his chest.Lucas was filled with despair as he looked at Jacob, who was now probably looking at him since he couldn't tell anything because of Jacob's concealed face and eyes. But he does know it is now his turn."W-…." His words were caught in his throat as he started to cough violently, and this time he was literally vomiting blood with every cough."As I said, I'll relieve you guys, and I didn't lie. The thing is, your condition is terminal, and in my knowledge, there's no cure, no in this plain at least. There might be one in higher plains where the medical field is at a much higher level than this place."My deceased wife also suffered from such condition in the distant past, and she was in too much pain both physically and mentally…" Jacob's voice suddenly contains a hint of melancholy."Oh, forgive me, I derailed from the topic all of a sudden. Anyhow, death is the only solution, and it will come eventually. At least I can put you out of your misery painlessly since you provide me with this wonderful lab that will serve my needs for a while." Jacob chuckled coldly before he moved.Lucas was still coughing like crazy, his vision was already cloudy, and his mind was filled with despair and misery.The last thing he remembered was feeling a sharp pain in his chest before all that pain and misery faded away… he was really revealed!Jacob looked at corpses with two holes in their chests without any hint of remorse and then averted his eyes, and they fell on the things Mason left.He walked over and picked up the map scanner and stored it away since it wasn't of any use to him yet. Except for that map scanner, he found two other things which drew his attention. They were two jars of glowing liquid, one was green, and it was over half filled, and one was sky blue, and it hadn't been used before.'Advance Type-1 Healing and Magic Recovery Potions? He even had over 1 liter of healing liquid and 3 liters of magic recovery potion. Just one drop of these liquids dilated in 1-liter spring water could heal any outer wounds and 20% mana below extraordinary rank.'Don't tell me one of them was a potion alchemist. Well, that explains how these guys were alive all this time.' Jacob thought while putting those potions in his pendant.Now, he was also a potion alchemist of Senior Grandmaster Rank, so he knew just how precious these potions were, not to mention their creation process was tedious.Except for those potions, Jacob didn't find anything work talking as all of those remaining materials were junk to him. Mason probably used all the precious materials to create those two potions.Nevertheless, Jacob's true prize on this trip was that big boulder of plutonium. His eyes shimmered as he mused, 'Let's see how I can compress this huge lump. I should be done in a week or two before I get the reply from the dark city. Only then can I decide my next course of action…'Without wasting more time, he got to work.---Three days later, in the dark city, noble circle,Hallberg was looking at the hologram report with wide-opened eyes as if he was reading something horrifying."H-how is this even possible? Can one person really do all this?" He muttered with disbelief and a hint of terror."How accurate is this report?" He asked Dark Rose."80%. Dark Viscount Water Wave examined the battlefield herself, and she found over 500 corpses, and almost all of them were killed by beheading with a single sword slash."Through her connections in the star mercenary agency, she found that all those official mercenaries were on a secret commission to hunt Faceless Ancient. Even her friend Dark Baron Fire Cannon and two other Dark nobles were involved in this, and their Dark Badges are now voided, which likely means they are dead."Not only them, but there was another group involved in that attack since those extra over two hundred bodies didn't belong to any official mercenary. Still, this incident has caused huge losses to the agency, and right now, Bank manager Leroy has summoned a meeting between three hegemonies' upper echelons in the dark city." Dark Rose statically reported.Hallberg found it amusing as he asked, "Did he know the Alchemy Guild Leader of the Dark City is probably the one who is behind this massacre, and they were the ones who were targeting him first? Is that idiot finally gone off his rails?""I don't know. But Leroy didn't invite Guild Leader Faceless Ancient; instead, he invited the former Guild Leader Braylon. He might've done this after knowing that the Guild Leader Faceless Ancient is currently unavailable in the Dark City." Dark Rose replied.Hallberg chuckled coldly, "Dark Rose, you're still just an AI, so you don't know the matter of men. That Leroy is an old schemer and Braylon, and he is very tight."Since Braylon was forced to give away his position, he naturally considered Faceless Ancient his enemy. Now that the bank has suffered huge losses, Leroy would be the one who got blamed for this blunder, not the one behind that secret commission."If I'm not wrong, this secret commission has come from epic plains and from a very high-ranking member of the bank at that. Now, that person behind is using Leroy as a scapegoat, and that poor fellow had no choice but to become one."But what I don't understand is what that guy is now trying to do by summoning this meeting between three hegemonies. I never thought my last days in the dark city would be so entertaining, and all this revolves around one person."Hallberg's eyes shimmered with great interest, "Maybe it's time for me to have a chat with this Faceless Ancient…"

Chapter 293 Contact!
﻿Jacob was busy looking at the numbers on a screen display connected with a molding machine with scrutiny when he felt his star watch vibrates.He knew only a few people could contact him in rare plains, so whoever it was, it had to be someone with at least 1-star privilege or someone he sent a message or call to or added as a friend.After giving those complex numbers a last glance and finding nothing wrong, he opened his star watch interface and saw it was an audio call from Dilly, which he was expecting in the first place.So, he accepted it without any delay as he was hoping to hear good news."Greeting Guild Leader." Dilly's somewhat apprehensive voice rang."Get to the point." Jacob coldly commanded as he didn't have much time to waste."Right away." Dilly quickly stated, "I contacted my connection in the noble circle, and according to him, it's impossible to send a message or even approach the Dark Earl's manor. Only if Dark Earl invited someone himself, only then can someone approach that place." His voice sounded depressed and fearful.Jacob frowned as he didn't blame Dilly since he knew just how high-status dark nobles held in the dark city, so how could the lord of the city be approached so easily?At least that guy didn't try to cheat him out of his ZC by providing false information. So, he knew he had to search for those reaming materials himself. The only problem was that Black Robe Alchemist still hadn't replied to his message, and he didn't know any places which matched the inhabitant environment for Nightmare Lilly in the rare plains.So, it might pose some problems.Anyhow, he would worry about that bridge when it was time to cross it, he was still busy dealing with the plutonium, and he had to be very careful not to blow himself up."Alright, you did well." Said Jacob, and he was about to end the call when Dilly promptly said, "Wait, there's something else, Guild Leader!"Jacob frowned, "What is it?""Bank Manager Leroy called three hegemonies collective meeting today and invited the upper echelon of the three powers in the dark city. He even invited Dark Earl." Dilly quickly reviled.Jacob's dismissive look at the end turned sharp, "Something like that happened? I don't care about this meeting. Just tell me, how did Dark Earl respond?""How could that be? The Dark Earl had never bothered himself with matters of three hegemonies as long as they were not related to the dark city itself. So, this time wasn't any different."What I want to talk about is that Bank manager Leroy didn't send an invitation to you, the active Guild Leader but Senior Braylon in the common circle. He even changed the meeting place to the common circle so he could easily attend it."He didn't even bother to invite anyone from the inner circle. This is blunt disrespect towards you, Guild Leader, and everyone is unhappy." Dilly angrily stated.Jacob cocked an eyebrow since this matter was really fishy, and he guessed it was likely related to the massacre three days ago.Because this Bank Manager was the one who called this meeting, and the star mercenary agency was affiliation organizing of the bank.Whichever the case was, Jacob didn't care about those small characters' schemes anymore. As long as he is in the rare plains, he'll just kill anyone who wants to die early. He dismissively asked, "Is that it?"Dilly was speechless on the other side as he didn't expect this kind of response from the tyrant Guild Leader."That's what I think so. I'll be back in a week, so don't disturb me unless you have a way to contact Dark Earl or he appeared outside the noble circle." Jacob scoffed before he cut the call without waiting for a reply.This matter wasn't even worth remembering for him. He was just about to go back to whatever he was doing when his star watch vibrated again, making him scowl. When he looked at the interface, astonishment flashed past his eyes because it was an unfamiliar caller ID."Great Hallberg wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!"'Hallberg? Someone from the Killer Skull Society or from the Bank?' Jacob's frown deepened as he clearly had no idea just who this fellow was, and his ID was at least 1-star, so he guessed it was another character from the epic plains. And he only offended two sides in that place, so those two names came to mind.Nevertheless, he still picked up the call with a blurry projection setting since this guy could be from the guild for all he knew.The moment he accepted the call, Hallberg's dark yellow blurry figure materialized. He also didn't want to show his true appearance to Jacob not yet."Who are you?" Jacob asked coldly, looking at the blurry figure.He never got the point of a projection call. If you still want to hide your face, you can directly send an audio call. But these bigwigs like to put the façade of mystery."Heh, aren't you been looking for me? I'm the Dark Earl of Rare Plains Dark City!" Hallberg revealed imposingly in a deep tone. He had no intention of hiding his identity.Jacob's eyes widened as he felt like it was some kind of trick, he was looking for this guy and to no avail, but now he was contacting him on his own. So, no one could blame him for thinking that it was some kind of joke.Still, only a few alchemists knew he was looking for Dark Earl, and this guy seemed to know he's been looking for the Dark Earl. Not only that, but his Star ID was also at least 1-star, and if he was really the real Dark Earl, then this meant he wasn't the only one present in the rare plains who had a 1-star privilege Star ID.The enigmatic Dark Earl was also a 1-star privilege Star ID holder, and the reason was enough for Jacob to take this guy seriously if it turned out to be the real deal!

Chapter 294 I’m Glad That…
﻿Jacob regained his calm as he spoke impassively, "How do you know I was looking for you? Besides, even if I were looking for the enigmatic Dark Earl, I don't think you would be so kind as to approach me just because of this reason. Everything aside, I don't believe you are the Dark Earl."Although Jacob was really looking for Dark Earl and it would've been alright if he had approached the other party. But the thing was, the Dark Earl approached him, which changed everything.First, he needed to confirm if this was the real deal or not, and second, he needed to know why he even bothered to contact him.Hallberg guffawed all of a sudden on the other side, which made Jacob's eyes narrow.He finally spoke in an amusing tone, "You're really careful and mistrustful, huh? Well, a person of your caliber should be like this. Since you don't believe I'm the real deal, how about you pay me a visit to the noble circle?"Jacob's eyes glimmered sharply before he replied, "I'm not a dark noble.""Heh, do you think I don't know? But I can arrange that for you. It's the perks of being the Lord of a Dark City. So, are you down?" Hallberg inquired jollily as if he was talking with a long-lost friend, not some stranger.But this action only made Jacob warier of Hallberg's intentions because if he was apprehensive of something in the rare plains, it was without a doubt the Dark City where even three hegemonies have to behave.Furthermore, if Hallberg was really the Dark Earl, then this means this guy was another person present in the Rare Plains with 1-star privilege, and he knew for a fact getting that status was not as easy as it sounds. He only got it after he became the champion of the Rare Plains.If it was someone from the Epic Plains, he might not bother since they can't do a thing to him. But now, it's not the same thing.Still, Jacob knew this was a chance to meet the Dark Earl in person, and he may be able to strike a deal with him about the materials he required, and it would be more convenient to make a deal face to face. Even if things turn awry, Jacob is confident in escaping, especially since he now has plutonium in hand.So, he replied, "Alright, I agree to this meeting. It's better this way.""Excellent! I haven't entertained a guest in decades. Expect it to be a feast." Hallberg's elated voice rang from the other side, "So when are you coming?"Jacob felt this guy was too optimistic about this entire thing. But his doubt about Hallberg's identity was now almost clear, so he knew he had to meet him.Anyway, he was planning on paying one last visit to the dark city and settling everything before he left for good, so meeting Hallberg was a bonus."I'm still in the magic beast forest taking care of some unfinished business. I'll return in 10 days." Jacob replied."Just send me a message at the city entrance, and I'll have Dark Rose arrange for your escort to the noble circle," Hallberg replied."Will do."Afterward, the call ended, and Jacob received a friend request from Hallberg almost instantly. After some consideration, he accepted it since this guy was quite resourceful.But he still has to see if he is trustworthy or not. He would only know after this meeting. It would be a lie to say that Jacob wasn't looking forward to it as well. He wanted to see just what kind of person the Dark Earl was and why he took an interest in him!---Three days later, in the common circle of Dark City, three figures sat around a round table.One of them was an elf wearing scholarly white robes. He was none other than the former alchemy guild leader, Braylon. However, from his past amiable aura, he was giving off a cold, distant feeling.Then there was a three-meter-tall giant with a burly build and bronze skin. He was the current Nightmare Knight Commander of the Nightmare Knight Legion of the Dark City, Tomas, also known as Bronze Giant.Lastly, an average size man wearing a black suit and his face concealed by a purple mask was sitting straight between the two. Only his astute snake eyes were visible behind that purple mask. He was the Bank manager of Dark City's Zodiac Taurus Bank, Leroy, and also the person who called this meeting."So, why do you bring us here from the actual meeting room?" Tomas coldly questioned in his heavy mountain-like voice.Leroy's husky voice rang, "Tomas, don't pretend you didn't know about any of this. On the contrary, I'm pretty sure you know too well and are part of this now."Braylon clearly had no idea what the meaning of those ambiguous words was, so he decided to seek it coldly, "What are you two talking about? You do know that I have no power in the alchemy guild now. If you're scheming something against the current guild leader, then you better leave me out of this."Braylon wasn't a fool as he could easily guess Leroy's intent by not inviting Jacob here, which was an act of blunt provocation.Furthermore, he didn't want to cross that madman after his short encounter with him. He lost everything without even doing anything, and so he didn't want to find out what would happen if he did something.He was only here because of the good relationship with Leroy, and he even planned to tell Jacob all about this meeting to enter his good books.However, after coming here, he found that things were not as simple as they seemed."Heh, that guild leader of yours is really something, I must say." Tomas suddenly declared, and there was a hint of deep respect in his voice.He then looked at Leroy and coldly replied, "I know what you're thinking, but sorry to say, the Chairman told us not to interfere with your side this time. And for once, I'm glad that we are not fighting that monster. But I'm still quite curious. Why the hell do you keep provoking him?"Leroy's snake pupils narrowed into slits when he heard Tomas's unexpected words, while Braylon was completely out of the loop now."But I was informed the alliance would be our allies in this venture?" Leroy coldly uttered!

Chapter 295 Rather Be A Deserter Than Deceased
﻿"But I was informed the alliance would be our allies in this venture?" Leroy coldly uttered!In response, "Hah, don't make me laugh. Do you think of us as mercenaries like yourself who would sway by money? I admit we do like fighting and killing, but we do not like throwing our lives away."That monster killed over 500 hundred people within six hours, and I know those guys didn't even put up a fight from their clean deaths. He's likely in the wind now. So, why the fuck do we want to go after him to waste our resources on a ghost chase. Even if we found him, you and I both know without an army, we'll die." Tomas snarled disdainfully.Braylon's instantly got the idea of what they were talking about and almost fell from his position!Sweat started to bead over his forehead, and his heart raced as he thought, 'Kill 500?!' He never thought of that terrifying guy but this terrifying, not by a long shot. He even starts to feel as if he is sitting on thorns now because he accepted this invitation despite knowing it was disrespectful towards Jacob.Although he had no intention of going against him and even wanted to act as a double agent, would Jacob believe him?"Just what the hell is going on here?" He blurted with a pale face as he stood up from his seat.Tomas gave Braylon a snickering glance before he said, "It seemed you really didn't know anything about the incident a week ago. Don't worry; your friend will tell you all about it. I'm sure he summoned you here to discuss exactly that."Leroy's expression was ugly at this moment as he clearly wasn't expecting this turn of events. This entire incident had nothing to do with him. He only found out like everyone else.But just his bad luck, he was contacted by someone who he couldn't disobey and had to take full responsibility for this entire incident. In return, he was promised something he couldn't refuse, wealth and a ticket to higher plains.Not only that, but he was also given another mission, which was to unite the masses against Jacob and then ruin his public image as well as his guild image.Furthermore, he was told there would be another attempted assassination, and this time they would have the ZWA (Zodiac Warrior Alliance) full support as well.However, now Tomas was straight out refusing him, and he even brought the ZWA Chairman into it, which means he was likely telling the truth.This could only mean two things, the negotiation between ZWA and UZB (Universal Zodiac Bank) has failed!Leroy was now feeling extremely gloomy as this would also make things nastier for him. He clearly won't lead the charge to hunt Jacob himself. He cares about his life more than some empty promises.Likewise, he would rather be a deserter than deceased!However, he still didn't understand one thing. He asked with a raspy voice, "Just why did you kick him out of ZWA if he's such a powerful figure and let him join the guild?"Braylon also looked at Tomas because he always wondered about it. It was quite clear that Jacob was now an official member of the guild, but he knew that he was a former ZWA member.He had made the mistake of thinking that he could kick Jacob out since he didn't belong to the guild, but he learned the hard way that he was extremely wrong.Jacob was an official member even before he met Braylon, which meant he was contacted by someone with the same status as him, and Braylon had no idea who that person was, to tell the truth.But this just made him more fearful because there was a chance he had supporters from the higher plains, and that's why he didn't want to cross him ever.Tomas's grin stiffened when he heard that question as if someone had stabbed him right in the gut. He naturally knew Jacob was an official member of ZWA because he was appointed to this position by one of his pawns in the freedom plains, Nixon!At that time, Jacob was still considered to be a blanker, and he wanted to earn his loyalty by providing him with resources and leaving it to Nixon to handle it.However, before their plans were even put into motion, Jacob's 'kidnapping' happened, and everything goes down to the hills.But Tomas had never even thought that a nobody would turn out to be a monster within a few years who even he had to look up to.He even took the man for someone else when he found that he was a permanent member of the guild.However, when he got recently contacted by the ZWA Chairman, the person he worships, he found out a terrifying truth.The Faceless Ancient of the Alchemy Guild was the same Faceless Ancient he once wanted to take as his subordinate.Not only that, Gunnar even admitted that he made a mistake by kicking that guy out because of his own misgivings about Jacob. If he had known that guy was really capable of such a feat, he wouldn't have made that deal.Alas, there was no medicine for regret in this world, and now that terrifying fellow was almost untouchable in the rare plains. The ZWA could've been the strongest by his side, but now they weren't even dared to face the guy.Anyhow, Gunnar didn't take the offer Lucy wanted to give him as he didn't want to send his men on this suicidal mission. As a fighter himself, he knew way better just how much manpower it would take to take Jacob down.So, now the agency was helpless without the legion's help!As for the answer to Leroy's question, Tomas only said four ambiguous yet ugly words, "I have no idea."Leroy almost flew in rage upon hearing this but controlled himself, "Why are you chickening out?! He might be gravely wounded right now, for all we know. Just help me out, and I'll make it worth your while!""I have some very good deals with you in the past, Leroy, but this time, I'm not going to take this one." Tomas coldly rejected.At this moment, a knock rang on the door."What is it?" Leroy angrily asked, as he was in a very bad mood right now."Sorry to intrude, but we received an important report right now!" A panicked voice rang.Leroy frowned, hearing this unfamiliar voice, and before he could reply, Tomas said, "It's one of my men. Come in."A burly troll entered the room, and with panic-stricken eyes, he blurted without even greeting the three. It also reflected just how panicked he was by this report."T-the Wild Nation! It's the Wild Nation, the mad Lich King has declared his intention of whipping every living being on the Rare Plains after his full victory over the Freedom Plains."The Dark Armies are marching toward the magic beast forest as we speak, and not only that, but the Lich King specifically called out the Dark City!"

Chapter 296 When It Rains, It Pours (1)
﻿Today, the sky was covered in black rainy clouds as thunder rumbled, making the beasts in the magic beast forest restless.At this moment, in a particular area of the inner magic beast forest, the ground suddenly started to shake. The booming sounds reverberated in the vicinity as if someone was trying to tear apart the earth."Bommm…"A piece of ground blasted in the air with some trees, revealing an underground passage. Jacob walked out of this passage looking the same as usual."This door took three punches for me to break it. Not bad," Jacob muttered, looking at the broken, hidden doors of Lucas's hidden base.In the end, he shook his head. He can't remain here any longer, and this place will likely become someone else's property or some magic beast will occupy it.Anyway, he took anything worth taking, so he didn't care much about this place anymore, and he had already achieved what he wanted to by coming here.'I managed to process all the plutonium two days prior to my estimate. Well, I hope the Dark Earl won't mind if I come to visit two days earlier.' Jacob thought before he moved, turning into a blur in the direction of the dark city.This time, Jacob's journey was quite smooth as no one was there to obstruct his way, and he guessed those corpses probably spooked those annoying guys away.'Tip… tip…'Raindrops suddenly started to fall at this moment, and within a few seconds, they started to pour.Although Jacob wasn't bothered by the rain, it still obstructed his hearing sense. But for him, this was just like a casual rain, so he continued making his way toward the dark city, which was now over ten miles away.However, when Jacob was only two miles away from reaching the waterfall canyon, Jacob suddenly felt a strange unease for no reason.With a deep frown, Jacob slowed down and focused on his surroundings, but except for that rain, everything was perfectly normal.However, that strange, uneasy feeling got intensified the closer he got to the canyon and just won't go away."Cursed Immortality!" Jacob decided to summon Cursed Immortality instated of taking more risks.He was saving this summons when he entered the Dark City's Noble Circle. However, he had never felt like this before, so he just wanted to confirm if this feeling was just a false alarm or if there was some sort of danger hidden near the dark city.It was better to be careful than sorry.However, just when he summoned Cursed Immortality, all the surrounding rain stopped, which made Jacob bewildered since it was simply too sudden, and when he looked up, his heart sank.Because he saw the rain wasn't stopped, instated it was obstructed by invisible doom, and this doom was fifty-meter-high and probably five hundred meters wide. Not only that, but Jacob felt he was deaf as all sounds were cut off.Almost instantly, Jacob's entire body trembled as he felt goosebumps rising, and the fine hair on his body stood in alarm.However, without sound, Jacob's balance systems were greatly effective, which was clearly the scheme here, and the other party wanted to take full advantage of it as well.But Jacob wasn't so easy to subdue either. Within that instant, his two swords appeared in his hand while he twisted his body to the right.Just when Jacob started to twist his body, a red streak appeared right where his chest was a moment ago. However, Jacob was far from out of danger. He only managed to avoid the blow to his chest.Because at that same time, Jacob felt something sharp with a force of at least over ten kilotons land over his shoulder, which should be supposed to be for his neck.The windbreaker he was wearing had at least a basic-type-2 defensive capability, and he was wearing a shirt made with the same type of material, so that blade didn't manage to wound him.However, after the second attack in succession, another came, which was headed toward his head!But now he also got enough time to move his sword, and he used it as a shield to protect his head without hesitation.ραпdα---nᴏνa| сom 'Bang…'Although he managed to block that dark blue streak, Jacob instantly received a terrible impact on his head, which wasn't any lower than ten kilotons.All happened in one second in slow motion, and the moment that second passed, 'Swish…'Jacob's body blasted in the right direction crushing many trees in its path.Jacob felt his head ringing, but he knew if he succumbed to this pain and didn't recover fast, he would be dead since this three-way attack was perfectly coordinated.This time, his enemy was extremely sneaky that even he didn't see them coming, nor they gave him any chance to even look at Cursed Immortality which was hovering in front of him.He simply summoned it too late!His heart entered 10X acceleration at this moment, and Jacob regained his sense and maneuvered in the air to stabilize himself on the ground.However, his enemy seemed to be even faster than him as he could now sense another deadly attack coming right behind his neck and another one from the air!Without hesitation, the sword in his hand rotated backward, and he stabbed it to the back without even looking while his second sword rotated upward and he thrust it toward the air."Cling…"Eerie sounds of metal clinging together rank almost instantly, and Jacob felt pressure behind those two attacks. Although they weren't equivalent to Epic rank, they were not far either.But this action also exposed all of Jacob's body, and when Jacob sensed two more attacks were coming from right up ahead, he knew there were more than three attackers, and his eyes went deadly grim!Using his superior physical strength, he slashed the sword, which was blocking the attacker in the air, down with the attacker itself.Those two attackers' attacks were instantly disrupted by this action.At this moment, Jacob finally got a glimpse of Immortika, who had written something, and his heart sank when he saw the very first line."There are five legendary descendants!"Right at this moment, Jacob saw a sharp edge appear out of nowhere, and it was only an inch away from his left eye!

Chapter 297 When It Rains It Pours (2)
﻿The blade appeared literally out of nowhere, and the moment Jacob realized that it was there, it was already touching his mask's eye, which was made with a basic-type-1 glass known as Sky Glass.Sky glass has a clear reflection on one side while the other side looks like a solid surface, and it is quite sturdy and stainless. Not even an Advance Type-0 weapon could scratch its surface.However, the assassins were clearly quite professional, and they probably knew what kind of target they were going to assassinate, so they clearly won't come with some type-0 weapons.So, Jacob knew that even if he managed to evade, his eye was as good as gone. What he should be worried about was that blade managed to penetrate deep into his skull.That's why Jacob started to retract his head backward while the blade edge was already breaking past the sky glass and now only a hair away from touching the cornea, and almost at the same time, it turned fiery crimson!Thereby, Jacob felt a sharp, fiery pain in his eye as if someone was piercing his eye with a scorching skewer.When the bade finally started to enter it, his entire eye went blind, leaving only the fiery pain.But he knew it was unavoidable. As the blade entered three to four-millimeter-deep into his eye socket, it started to go upward toward his eyebrow because of Jacob's timely retracing his head backward.However, this didn't mean he was out of the wood, not by a long, showing that fiery blade directly cut through his eye and skin. It even managed to scorch his skull before its left's Jacob head.Not only did the blade manage to take out his eye and nearly kill him, but his mask and hood were also blown apart by the sharp, fiery intent behind that blade.Jacob's face was revealed, with a deeply charred gush over his left eye, while his right bloodshot eye was deadly cold and filled with disbelief. He never thought he would come closer to death despite his current prowess in the rare plains.He thinks of himself as someone who could easily avoid danger in the rare plains. But now he knows he was too naïve. No amount of preparation could compare to the unknown dangers, and this lesson could only learn through deadly experiences.Jacob looked at the crimson blade going over his head, and at this moment, his heart rate jumped to 20X acceleration.The gush on his eye started to mend visibly the moment he entered that state, while his other amber eye turned bright golden before multiple colors shimmered in his retina.The moment seemed to slow down for Jacob, and he could overwatch his surrounding in one meter like that was now part of his vision. There wasn't any blind spot nor any hidden enemies in this range anymore.Jacob's hand moved from the back, which was blocking the attack from behind, and directly slashed toward the blade's owner, who was in a straight position which his sword moving over Jacob's head.His sword cut passed the hand holding the blade before it moved directly toward the neck.Before the other party realized it, he was cleaved into three pieces, and Jacob's body moved so fast those other four attacks were still probably thinking that he was pinned down, while he was now almost freed from that deadly lock.The 20X acceleration was something that could make his speed increase by 20 times, as well as his reaction speed. His mind works at terrifying speed while his vision sees many things which he can't normally see.The most terrifying about achieving a 20X boost on his current level was that one-meter zone where Jacob felt he was a god and nothing could escape him. So, he called it God's Zone.However, this didn't mean there wasn't any price to pay. In 20X acceleration, his body energy also rapidly depleted to fuel that massive acceleration.Jacob's conjecture was he could only maintain this acceleration for around 1 minute, even with the Unique Endurance of a Wyvern, or his body would start burning his muscles.That's why he didn't use it carelessly since he would need a massive amount of nutrition to regain his peak condition.However, now, after almost dying, he couldn't care less about that price. He wanted these guys dead!The remaining four finally realized that their companion was dead when his sword-wielding hand, head, and body started to split into three pieces, and somehow Jacob's speed greatly surpassed their own reaction speed.ραпdα---nᴏνa| сom When any of them realized that Jacob was gone and now attacking them, it was already too late as his sword was hacking down toward the three guys in front, like unstoppable wind, and slipped past them like a butter knife before they could even react.Jacob then finally turned around toward the last guy who attacked from behind while the blood wasn't even falling to the ground of his newly cleaved victims.His eye was exempt from any emotion, and only bloodlust was emitting from his very being.Without hesitation, he threw his sword toward the last person who was trying to retreat but appeared extremely slow in Jacob's vision, and the sword directly stabbed into his head!Only after confirming that there weren't any more attackers did Jacob start to calm down, and his heart exited the acceleration state. His entire skin was scorching while steam was rising. He looked like a crimson devil with his one scorched eye.At this moment, the barrier above suddenly burst like a bubble before the rain started to pour down again. This clearly has something to do with those five attackers' death.Jacob felt somewhat better under that cold rain and finally took a careful look at the appearance of those five death assassins. Before, he only cared about killing them and didn't have time to waste looking at their appearance.The moment he saw those corpses, his eye turned deadly cold, but there was a hint of dread present in it.Those five were dressed in white robes with black hourglass symbols on their chests while their bodies were wrapped in black gauze. They were just like those two mysterious figures hovering on the discs he killed on the day of the massacre!

Chapter 298 You’re Sick!
﻿"Iron Puppet Assassins has been killed by the target!"Iron Class Kill Order has entered the third and final stage!"10 Iron Puppet Assassins and 1 Bronze Puppet Assassin have been dispatched!" An electric voice rang in the secret library.The Goblette was putting back some old books when she heard it, and a hint of surprise flashed past her ruthlessly cold eyes.She muttered with interest and a hint of astonishment, "How can someone be capable of killing two waves of Iron Puppets in this place?"Now that the Iron Class Kill Order has entered its final stage, if it fails again, the Iron Constant has to pay 100 times the initial Iron Kill Order price before he can put a new kill order on any target again."I wonder if this target will survive and break the three-hundred-year Iron Kill Streak and…."Her muttering was like eerie noises within the silence of the library.---In heavy rain, Jacob looked at the cleaved corpses with his icy gaze.He walked toward them as he started to feel lethargic again, and this time, this feeling was quite intense, as if he would fall asleep the moment he closed his eyes and let his vigilance go.However, his left eye was still burning while his vision was dark, so it was enough to keep him awake, and now he was going to eat them all to recover his depleted energy, not to mention their hearts were even more nutritional and precious.But this didn't mean he was happy about getting almost killed by this bunch. He was lucky he only lost an eye, and if he had been wearing his old dressing, he would've been stabbed multiple times before that guy would've claimed his head."Just who the fuck are they? They clearly belonged to the same organization. What kind of species are they from?" Jacob asked Immortika sternly, who was hovering there all this time.Today he also learned just how important Immortika's ability to see through any species is, and he shouldn't hesitate to use it if he ever started to feel uneasy. He only has one life, and there's no point in holding back on it."Hahahaha… they almost had you, huh? I must say, the attack was almost impeccable. They first put a magic barrier with a soundless effect to throw you off your balance for a few moments, and they took full advantage of those moments."Since you put up a good show for me, I'll reveal something interesting about these guys, which I ignored last time."Jacob's expression instantly darkened when he saw the 'ignored' part, he knew it was nothing but bull crap, and his rage was almost boiling."Hey, hey, hey, why do you look so mad? I didn't lie to you about them being legendary descendants or anything. I just forgot to mention that they were not naturally born and were some sort of mutants who seemed to didn't have a will of their own." Immortika revealed.Jacob's eyes narrowed, "Mutants? Like the Cannibals of the Killer Skull Society? So, they are the ones behind it?"Jacob felt it was most likely the case as he instantly remembered the Apocalyptic-S's threat, and his heart went cold. He didn't think she was still hiding those mutants somewhere, and they were so terrifying.But this also raised another question in his mind, 'If they can produce such mutants, then why did they want the data from common plains, cannibal plan? Is there something I'm missing? I should check that data thoroughly!'"How did I know who's behind it? All I can say is these mutants are millions of times superior to the ones you encountered in the type-0 plains."Not only are they made with legendary descendants as a core, but they even surpassed the limits of what they can do without turning into those mutants."Like the one who almost blew off your face was a true Dark Elf who was born a rare and might've become unique. But you could've seen him coming a few feet away despite his assassin-like characteristics, but you sensed him when he was a few inches away from you."And you know the fascinating part? This guy can use fire magic with his shadow magic simultaneously, which should be only possible with the Epic Star Magic Core. Now, this is what we called a mutant, and somehow you seemed to be their target, ahhahaha!"Jacob's expression turned darker the more he read as his heart became heavier toward the end, even though he didn't mind the endless supply of mutant hearts, which were a good thing for his Cursed Blood Condensing stage.But these guys' strange abilities to keep themselves hidden until the very last moment were very dangerous for him as he only sensed them when he was in the 15X acceleration state.Now, he discovered that they could even use something that only an epic rank can."I shouldn't have put the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual to hold. I need to find a way to use magic as well or at least know more about it to counterattack. Knowledge about alchemy is not enough when it comes to fighting."And I can get rid of their invisibility with special glasses since they emit thermomagnetic waves. They can forget about sneaking up on me like this unless they turn really invincible. So, do you have any suggestion for me on this?" He looked at Immortika while he unwrapped the faces of those corpses, and they were the same as the last ones, faceless!"You have your own solution to this problem, and this is the true way to become stronger. As for your eye, it will recover as long as you eat high-quality meals or herbs because of your cursed heart. So you already got all the help from my side. I'm just a book, after all. Hehehe.""Yep, a book that withheld important information and nearly got its owner killed." Jacob sneered coldly as he cut open the corpse's chest and took out its heart, and started eating it as he was feeling tired."It's part of your training, and it will be too boring for me if you already know everything. This way, it would be more interesting." Immortika replied matter-of-factly.It clearly didn't care if Jacob doubted it or not, as it only wanted a kick out of everything.Jacob coldly commented before he ignored it, "You're sick, and I'm even more who is following you!"

Chapter 299 The Incoming Danger
﻿An hour later, after the attempted assassination of Jacob, he was now standing outside the Dark City entrance. He looks the same as he did an hour ago. Despite his masked breaking, he got a spare, so it didn't affect him much.The only difference was he was blinded on his left side, although Immortika told him the eye would be recovered as long he consumed high-quality materials.But even after eating those five guys whole and their hearts, only a deep scar over his left eye was recovered while his charred socket and the eye were still the same.After his inquiring with Immortika, he found that his eye was destroyed by the magic, and he had to regrow it, which meant he needed far more nutrition than just five extraordinary rank beings with legendary descendants states.If he needed to regrow his eye, he needed Advance Type-2 herbs or high-tier epic-rank beings, which was clearly impossible to achieve in rare plains!So, he thought of another solution, the Type-2 Titan Tears!After he managed to learn the rune language and philosopher language, he naturally examined this miraculous formula that can help anyone advance to a higher rank.He discovered the titan tears book not only contained type-0, and type-1, formulas of the potion, but there were still four unidentified formulas that he couldn't read because they were probably in type-2 philosopher's language.But with his current attainment in alchemy and the philosopher's language, he could still decipher the basic type-2 titan tears formula.As for the remaining formulas in the book, he knew they were probably above type-2 or even type-3 rank. He never thought this book discovered in the common plains would be so terrifying, and he almost traded it for a map. Anyhow, he knew as long as he created type-2 titan tears, his eye would be recovered.As for the advanced type-1 titan tears, which he already had in his pendant, he knew it was not enough, and he would only waste it, and he has other use for it, so he didn't want to use it as all the titan iron he bought from the champion's space was already used up.The advance type-1 rank titan iron was quite rare. Even in the guild, he only found around eight hundred grams, and he took it all.To make the basic type-2 titan tears, he naturally needs basic type-2 titan iron, and in the rare plains, he could only think of one person who might have it or at least knew where to find it, and he was currently headed to meet him right now.Lastly, he also got to see the final percentage of his Cursed Blood Condensing, which was 5.1%, and it was after eating eight legendary descendants' hearts!This naturally left Jacob depressed because he only got 0.2% added into his previous 4.9% Cursed Blood Condensing Stage. It was too low in his mind, and it wasn't seemed like worth trading his eye for and almost dying."Welcome to the Rare Dark City, Esteem Wanderer!"Please Identify yourself!"Seeking permission to scan the Star Watch"Will you accept?"Jacob heard Dark Rose's voice and the same notifications he heard when he entered the dark city for the first time. So, he allowed the scanning."Identity Scan Complete!"Faceless Ancient (Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith Alchemist)"Dark City Status: Alchemy Guild Leader"Dark City Criminal Record: None"Dark City Noble Title: Upper Dark Noble (Temporary)"Welcome Back, Sir Faceless Ancient!"You have an appointment with the Dark Earl."You have been allocated a 7-day pass in the Dark Noble City Circle by the Dark City Administrator (Dark Earl). Do you wish to start your visit right now or on a later day?"'At least he was the real deal.' Jacob felt somewhat good after confirming that the Dark Earl was really the real thing, and he arranged for his visit as he had promised.His evaluation of the guy raised a bit, but this didn't mean he would forget about the fact that the Dark Earl also has a 1-star privilege like him in the rare plains."I'll take it today," Jacob replied without hesitation, as he didn't have time to waste after the assassination an hour ago."Very well, please embark on the lift Sir Faceless Ancient. It will take about 2 hours to reach the noble circle. I'll inform the Dark Earl right away!"With Dark Rose's fading voice, the entrance slide opened for Jacob, and he entered without hesitation.If Jacob had known he had dodged a lethal bullet by deciding to enter the Noble Circle of the Dark City without wasting more time, he would appreciate Hallberg even more.---Within the Dark Castle of the Dark Earl,Hallberg, wearing a dark mask, sat on a dark throne like a king while there were nine figures sitting on the chairs two steps below his throne. It looked like a royal court of a king.Hallberg also didn't have that happy-go-lucky air around him anymore as he sat there with dignity, and those nine figures didn't dare to even breathe heavier in his presence."Did someone find out why the Lich King specifically said he would flatter the Dark City with the Magic Beast Forest? Who offend him from the Dark City?" His voice was extremely gloomy.A giant with a masculine build and deep scars over his face answered with a heavy tone, "My men approached him and tried asking the same thing, but he killed them. It's clear he had gone mad after his defeat in the dark ruins. He knew his days are number, as we all know with the incoming reinforcement, the Dark Beings will probably send his replacement.""We let him take the Freedom Plains exactly because he won't take this kind of foolish decision. But not only did he not appreciate our kindness, but he even dared to march his troops toward our city. Did he really think, since we don't interfere with day-to-day matters, the Dark City is afraid of some corpses?!" A tall orc woman with a white lion head roared furiously."Whichever the case is, I'm pretty sure many people in the dark city will try to run away as they are all here since they are cowards in the first place. I have already noticed people exiting the dark city silently, and those are probably the guys who know what is coming."Even some of our lower and upper dark nobles have shown signs of uneasiness, and some leave outright. Even some Dark Nobles in the Noble Circle are suggesting to evacuate the city post hastily as this fight is a lost cause." An elf worriedly stated."Heh, you're just expressing your own intentions in the sham of others. It's so like you, Dark Viscount Cloven." A 2.9-meter-tall giant woman wearing black battle armor scoffed disdainfully."Dark Viscount Water Wave, don't slender others without proof!" Cloven retorted with a dark expression while there was a hint of panic deep hidden in his eyes."Enough with this nonsense!" Hallberg slapped his hand over the handle of his throne and said in exasperation, "If the Dark Being Armies wanted to annihilate the Dark City, they needed to sweep through the magic beast forest first, and unlike Freedom Plains, we won't let them do that anymore."Let's chip away their numbers as much as we can before we deliver the killing blow once they enter the Dark Zone. Dark City has been silent for too long; it's time to show why even three hegemonies have to show respect in Dark City!"Hallberg coldly declared before his Star Watch vibrated…

Chapter 300 Meeting With Dark Earl (1)
﻿A luxurious carriage drawn by four Horn Horses, which were actually domestic rare rank magic beasts, was slowly making its way into the massive gates of the Dark Castle.The Dark Castle was designed like a medieval castle with pristine black stones, and there were dark guards of the Dark City patrolling on the walls while some were standing straight on their posts with all kinds of cannons and war machines.Watching all this setting closely was Jacob, who sat inside the carriage with his scrutinous gaze. After he entered the noble circle, this carriage was waiting for him right outside the station, which was naturally arranged by the Dark Earl.Jacob as a guest, can't reject this gesture if he doesn't want to appear rude toward the Dark Earl. If he didn't have a personal motive for meeting with Hallberg, he might've considered it.Furthermore, Jacob found the noble circle like the capital of some kingdom as it was completely different from the common and inner circles of the Dark City.There weren't many people on the streets, and those who were present were wearing the armor of the dark city.The buildings here were made with high-quality materials, and the architectural designs were marvelous. Anyone who had never experienced the circle of nobles would feel apprehensive pressure from this place.However, Jacob has many deals with nobles in his old life. Even some countries' kings were his business partners, so he wasn't pressured at all. On the contrary, he felt somewhat nostalgic while entering the dark castle.A very deep memory surfaced in his mind when he had just started making waves in the weaponry industry…---A middle-aged man with scholarly air stood in front of Jacob, who was in his late twenties, saying meaningfully, "Mr. Steve, I heard you have a promising proposal for our noble household, and I'm grateful that you chose us first over all other organizations."Jacob replied with a hint of apprehension while looking at his middle-aged man, "Your Highness, I'm also grateful for this meeting. About the project, I would like to change my mind on this. I'm not willing to hand over the full rights of my invention. But I want to enter a cooperating partnership with your company." He sounds even respectful as well as unsettled.The middle-aged man's eyes turned somewhat cold as he said, "Is our offer not to your liking Mr. Steve?""No, it's not like this. I'm extremely flattered by Your Highness's offer." Jacob sheepishly said, "B-but I don't want to stop here. I think I can do more, and your company is one of the paramount companies in the weaponry industry. If you give me this chance, I can assure you that I can make it the only paramount in the world!"The middle-aged man was startled by Jacob's words, and a chuckle escaped his mouth, "Mr. Steve, I like your ambition, but trust me, I like where my company is right now. As for you entering a partnership with my company, although your Friction Killer is a ground-breaking invention, it's not at the level where you enter a partnership with our company. I'm pretty sure anyone in my position would tell you the same."You see, Mr. Steve, in the weapon business, what matter is who has more firepower. Unless you discovered a way to make atomic bullets or a gun that can rapidly fire your friction-killer bullets, no one would take a risk at our level."Of course, if you want a job, I can offer you one as one of our chief science executives. We'll talk about partnership when you have someone more… practical to offer, not a dream. Dreams do not make money, Mr. Steve."Jacob's hopeful eyes visibly dimmed before they turned cold. He looked at the middle-aged man, who now had clear disdain in his eyes. He nodded, "It was indeed a mistake on my part to propose such an absurd notion. I beg your pardon, Your Highness Victor. I'll take my leave now."Victor took at Jacob, who stood up, and he had no intention of stopping him. He said at this moment, "About your Fiction Killer Bullets, although they are astonishing, they can be reverse-engineered. This is the main reason you can't make an impact on the weapon industry."Jacob's figure trembled ever so slightly, but he didn't turn around and merely nodded and walked away before saying, "I'll keep that in mind, Your Highness…"---"Heh…" Jacob snapped out of that memory with a scoff as the carriage was stopped.A Dark Guard opened the door before he solemnly stated, "Esteemed Guest, we are here."Jacob nodded before he disembarked the carriage and found himself standing in front of a grand entrance.His eyes landed on a 4'2 feet masked person with a burly build; however, his long thick bear was still quite visible, which made it quite clear he was a man. He was wearing blue attire while standing on both sides were two giants.One was 3.7 meters tall with a masculine build and deep scars over his face, and big fiery eyes exempt from any emotion. He wore a fully gray battle armor.While the other was a 2.9-meter-tall giant woman wearing black battle armor, she had an oval face, long black hair, and blue eyes, which were filled with scrutiny as she looked at Jacob's hooded figure.Jacob's eyes fell over the giant male, and he thought, 'He must be the Dark Earl.'However, he was astonished when the little man started walking toward him, and those giants followed behind. He completely ignored him because he didn't give him any sense of danger despite his noble demeanor."Hahaha… I didn't think you would come earlier than you told me to." Hallberg laughed heartedly as he greeted Jacob.'So, he is the Dark Earl, a Dwarf?' Jacob recognized Hallberg's voice and found it quite strange that a Dwarf was the most powerful person in the Dark City.It was quite an eye-opener for him. Still, his eyes were hidden, so those three didn't notice any of his expressions.Jacob then nodded in acknowledgment, "I hope I didn't intrude on His Excellency's peace.""Are you kidding? I'm glad you've decided to come early." Hallberg's candidly said, "Let me introduce you to these two nobles and also my good friends. This buff guy is Dark Viscount Stone Hammer, and this lovely lady here is Dark Viscount Water Wave. These two would be the strongest duo of our Dark City, of course, if I didn't include Sir Faceless Ancient. I hope you don't mind if they join us for a meal today."Jacob nodded in acknowledgment toward the two giants but only met with their cold gazes, especially Water Wave, as if she was holding some kind of grudge against him.eαglesnᴏνel But Jacob didn't give a damn about their feelings and was only giving Hallberg a face. He had killed many giants, and their physical appearance now had little effect on him."If Your Excellency's territory, anything goes as long as you're okay with it." Jacob coolly stated.Hallberg also noticed the giants' lack of response; a hint of unhappiness flashed past his eyes, but he couldn't embarrass the dark nobles in front of outsiders, so he pretended not to see it.He kept him here for a reason, and as long as they won't cross a certain line, he'll let them be.So, he replied to Jacob in an amicable manner, "Just call me Hallberg, and I hope to call you Jack as well. I don't like pleasantries, as long as it's fine with you, that is.""I don't mind." Jacob nodded as he found Hallberg's attitude genuine, not like Otto, who gave him a strange alarming feeling as if he was watched by a snake.Hallberg then beckoned Jacob inside while saying enthusiastically, "Let's go. I have arranged a feast!"
