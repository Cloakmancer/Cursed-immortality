Chapter 141 Achieving 1X Acceleration!
﻿After the 'visit' from the Kingdom's army, the lionheart city returned to its normal state.Since no dispute between the King and the Silver Tyrant appeared, many thought they both reached some kind of conclusion in secret. Or Silver Tyrant simply yielded to the King, or it might be the other way around.Nevertheless, those nobles didn't dare to make any kind of rumors since both parties were strong, especially the King who had influence over the entire kingdom.While Silver Tyrant was still garrison in lionheart city without showing any kind of movement.Those enslaved mercenaries also experienced peace after they were no longer required any minor work, and their duty was just to guard the mansion.The gunsmiths also returned after setting up Jacob's personal workshop in three days.However, Jacob never appeared and all these things were handled by Harrison, his trusted butler.Harrison has also undergone a change in his personality which had turned from timid to overbearing. He was no longer polite with those mercenaries anymore and acted like a real Tyrant's Butler.Jacob was sitting cross-legged in a meditative state on an iron platform while his head was completely submerged in water. If one looks at the other half, one will find a dark, deep chasm that is probably over five hundred meters deep.At this moment, a faint mist was forming around Jacob and absorbed by Jacob's body.He was already in water meditation status for over two and a half hours, and the water's oxygen was seeping into Jacob's body without any resistance. However, Jacob's focus was on reaming breathing and his heartbeat.After Jacob started water meditation in his new pool, which was like a deep well now, he no longer experienced any lack of oxygen, and his heartbeat increased steadily.However, Jacob didn't want to just increase his heartbeat with the help of water meditation. He wanted to control it at will so he could step into 1X acceleration at will without requiring any medium.After practicing day and night for over three weeks now, he finally bore results, and he can now increase or decrease his heart rate up to 8 BPS without water meditation.However, to decrease it, Jacob needs to sit in a meditative state. He can't decrease it while walking or doing some tasks. Nonetheless, this was still tremendous progress since it would decrease the chances of his heart rate going berserk in an acceleration state.His biggest problem was how to exit from fluid acceleration, so he wouldn't die once it started.Today, Jacob can finally control his 9 BPS heart rate and was ready to enter the 1X fluid acceleration for the first time.As more, and more oxygen seeped into his body, the more his heart rate increased and made his blood pump at high speed. If it was any normal human, their heart would've exploded, and only Jacob could remain expressionless with no hint of worry.It also revealed a new aspect of water meditation to Jacob, which was one required an extremely strong body to reach the end of this technique, and an extensive life span was related to the oxygen absorbed by the body.Although he didn't know the exact changes, this oxygen bought to the body, it wasn't harmful, and he even felt energized after exiting his meditative state and no longer needed to drink water at all.At this moment, Jacob's closed eyes snapped open as the surrounding water suddenly rippled slightly. His heartbeat was finally 10 beats per second, and he could feel the strange effects on his body and was much more vigorous.Suddenly he could feel the blood in his veins circulating at high speed and his heartbeat increasing!Without wasting even a second, Jacob stood up, breaking the water meditation effect and exited the pool, and quickly sat down in a meditative position again.His perspiration was dripping with water drops from his body, and his heart rate was already at 13 BPS within ten seconds. He finally understood why this ability was so dangerous if he didn't know how to control it.He quickly calmed down, but the blood circulation was making it very difficult, but Jacob had ample experience of over three weeks, so he didn't panic.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Furthermore, he could feel his heart rate no longer increase from 13BPS after he wasn't under 20-G pressure, and after spending ten minutes the heart rate finally decreased, but Jacob was filled with sweat, and his body looked slightly skinny.After fifteen more minutes, the heart rate finally decreased from 10BPS and slowly returned to its normal state.Jacob's expression was now pale as he opened his eyes filled with lingering fear, "Just to return from 13BPS to normal, I burn so much energy. If I were fighting, it would be a huge problem if I didn't finish my opponent, or I'll die under my own heart!"Jacob suddenly felt like being bulky wasn't a bad thing, or he required titan tears or something like this potion to replenish his depleted energy.Nevertheless, he still has a huge jar filled with titan tears, and he can spare some to control the fluid acceleration. Once he got complete control over it, he could enter and exit 1X acceleration at will without wasting any excessive energy.But one thing was obvious: the titan tears were going to play a huge part in learning the fluid acceleration of higher levels, and this made the elixir even more precious in Jacob's heart.After replenishing his energy with one titan tear's drop, this time he tried to enter the 1X acceleration without water meditation help…Just like that, 30 more days pass as Jacob never exited the pool area all this while without caring about what was happening in the mansion or in the uncommon region.On this day, Jacob finally left the pool area. He looked pale and skinnier, but his eyes were filled with calmness and vigor.This time, he headed toward his new workshop in the basement and started working on upgrading the titan sniper and new bullets!

Chapter 142 Do You Want To Be Silver Tyrant?
﻿Somewhere in the zodiac plains,In a dimly lit room, a being with a black horn was kneeling in front of a blurry projection.An aged voice sounded at this moment, "I contact you for an urgent matter, that could only be handled by you guys. For obvious reasons, we can't get involved in matters of this place."The kneeling being said nothing and remained silent, and continued to listen attentively."Send some people to the outer common plain. The Killer Skull Society is doing something there, and their target happened to be our branch, so make sure to make it clear. Also, migrate our branch into the central common plains with our other branch in that place without notice of anyone."This one seemed more promising than that one, and once they have star network assistance, they might have the potential to cross the common plains."Make sure no one found any connection with us, and as for the branch in the central plains, tell them to take care of this branch like their own people."Just to be on the safe side, wipe the entire outer common plains, including the dark city there, and put the blame on Killer Skull Society."Since they dared to touch our people, they should suffer the consequences!"The being solemnly nodded. "I'll personally arrange everything!"---At the border river between the uncommon and rare regions,A small black ship without sails was moving on the opposite of the water current without any resistance or air.The black ship docked at the side of the uncommon region lands, and three cloaked figures disembarked this black ship.Two of them were over two meters tall, while one of them was only two feet tall and walking with a small white beanpole in his pale green hand, which only had three sharp fingers with long nails."Alright maggots, since we didn't find our target in the marked area, he should still be hiding in this place somewhere. We'll separate into north, west, and south and slowly circle toward the east, which is our last destination."That maggot won't be able to remain hidden if he is still on this side of the river. If you found anyone suspicious, kill them. We also can't rule out the dark city. Use your authorities to check who had entered or exited in these past six months and then kill them all."Inform maggot A-9999 of our arrival and tell her the cannibal plan is the priority. She can leave this little maggot to us. We'll be there in eight or ten months to scan that area." The short person spoke in his cold, husky tone, filled with authority.He was clearly in charge among them.---At this moment, Jacob sat with an expressionless face while Harrison was reporting the events that transpired while he was not present.It had been five months since King Philip and the others had visited him, and besides some trivial things, nothing changed much. The uncommon region returned to peace after the war ended.However, Jacob knew it wasn't the case at all.Because half a month ago, Alice returned from the Aureate Kingdom and reported something unexpected. She told Jacob that some strange humanoid beasts had appeared in the Aureate Kingdom three months ago, and they were killing goblins and eating them in mass.Furthermore, these strange beasts were almost impossible to kill, and each time they kill and fed, they come back stronger and stronger.Right now, half of the goblin's kingdom was killed by these vicious beasts, and they look quite helpless against them.But the strange thing was these beasts remained in the Aureate Kingdom and didn't move in Earthen Kingdom's direction as if they had some kind of grudge against goblins and wanted to kill them all.Not only that, but the trolls were silently watching and any kind of plea for help was ignored by the trolls despite their friendly relationship for centuries.If Alice didn't have B-rank strength, she might've not returned and instead discovered by those beasts or trolls when she was returning.When Jacob heard this, he was naturally shocked, and then he thought about the mutant again. He was sure that the blood collection had something to do with the mutant creation.However, he wasn't in the least bit angry by this. On the contrary, he was thrilled because if those mutants were like the last one, then he could collect their heart and blood and increase his strength again!Jacob felt his decision to stick around was really wise, although the mutants were unexpectedly surprised by it didn't change anything. It made Jacob want to head there and start hunting those mutants.But he knew he couldn't be hasty with this, and this was just a trivial benefit in the face of what he truly wanted.He then gave Alice ten drops of titan tears since she still had her uses and sent her on another secret mission.Although she was curious about how Jacob knew this would happen, she didn't question him and left happily after taking the Titan Tears. As for if she could achieve an A-rank after consuming them, only she knows.Harrison didn't know this, he only knew Alice was sent on some mission by Jacob, and that's it. He also wanted to show his worth, so he also worked hard and learned combat while Jacob was away and collected any information that could interest Jacob.Today Jacob finally came out, and he quickly appeared to make his report.However, Jacob seemed uninterested in these reports."Alright, this is enough." Jacob stopped him and deeply looked at Harrison, "I heard some mercenaries whispering the other day that you killed three mercenaries while sparing?"Harrison's eyes dilated as his heart palpitated, and quickly kneeled and pleaded, "My lord, it wasn't my fault. It was just an accident, and those guys were the ones who wanted to spar with me."Jacob's lips curled up and mocked, "Lying, huh? Well, it doesn't matter. They were expendable, to begin with. Even if you kill them all, it doesn't matter to me. We can always get more. I just want to know how much are you confident in winning against other B-rank mercenaries?"Harrison felt cold sweat forming on his forehead when Jacob saw through his lies but didn't seem to care, which give him some comfort.He quickly replied with extreme confidence, "I can crush them now, my lord, just give your words!"Jacob nodded and coolly stated, "Good, send that second vice leader of tiger's den in. I want to have words with him. You go prepared, we're leaving tonight on a mission, and I required your assistance. If you did well, you'll get more black liquid as a reward."Harrison was startled for a moment before his eyes shimmered with ecstasy. He quickly thanked Jacob for giving him a chance to prove himself and left to fetch Shooter, the second in command of the tiger's den.Jacob didn't have to wait long before a skinny middle-aged man with fear in his eyes entered the room, and Harrison left afterward to prepare for the mission.Jacob looked at the skinny man, who seemed to have suffered torturous beatings from his appearance. He said, "Do you want freedom?"Shooter's listless eyes quickly showed a hint of light as he finally looked at Jacob, who had this faint smile on his face, but he whiffled his head and fell to his knees."I-I... I'm very happy as I am. Thank you for your generous offer, my lord."He didn't dare to say yes. He thought it was Jacob's trick to see if he still had any thoughts of rebellion.Furthermore, he had been the target of Harrison's beating for a few days, and he finally felt the mining was far easier than sparing with Harrison, who was sadistic and liked to torture them.They all thought it was Jacob who commanded Harrison to teach them a lesson in his place.Jacob looked at the trembling Shooter with no expression and coolly stated, "I'm going to leave this mansion tonight, and I won't be coming back, so you guys will naturally be freed. However, I want you to pretend to be me for two years. You can do anything under the name of Silver Tyrant, but for two years, you can't abandon this identity. What do you think?" Shooter was again staggered when he heard this and couldn't help but asked in a quavering voice, "W-why?"Jacob chuckled, "My goal was never to live here forever, and when the time was right, I would've left, just like now. But my sudden disappearance might not be a good thing. So, I want someone to take over my identity as the Silver Tyrant."Since Harrison is leaving with me, you are the only person with enough power and ability to handle those mercenaries, and they won't reject you either."As long as you play well, you can forever be the Silver Tyrant, living comfortably here with all those beauties and even collecting inducement from nobles who wanted to have a close relationship with Silver Tyrant."Jacob looked at the dazed Shooter and temptingly asked again, "So, do you want to be Silver Tyrant?"

Chapter 143 Jacob’s Scheme
﻿A few days later,In the Earthen Kingdom, deep within the forbidden forest, black smoke could be seen rising from a newly built stone building.Within this building was sitting Skull No. A-10000 inside a room watching a couple of Hob Trolls operating different equipment.He shifted his eyes and looked at the stone table. There was a ten-liter glass jar more than half filled with pitch-black liquid.His eyes shimmered with a hint of uncertainty. 'This Titan Tears elixir really had a miraculous effect on those mutants, and with half a litter, it could help them reach Common Tier-8. According to A-9999's observation, if the quantity of this would double, they could even reach Common Tier-9.'This is the effect of just the Basic Common Grade Titan Tears. There is still the Intermediate Common Grade Titan Tears Formula, which required Intermediate Grade Titan Iron and other auxiliary materials.'That elixir might be enough to make a common tier-9 species a peak common tier-12 species. If that bastard Faceless Ancient really had an Advance version of this elixir, it might be enough to help someone break into rare rank!'Greed surfaced in his eyes just thinking about it. The effect of Titan Tears was no longer a secret among the upper echelon of the Killer Skull Society.While Skull No. A-10000 and A-9999 also found the miraculous effect of titan tears when used on those mutants.That's why the society informed them to keep a tight lid on the matter, especially until they found that Faceless Ancient and confirmed if he really had higher-level Titan Tears formula in his possession or not.Nevertheless, the cannibal plan was far more important, and to make sure nothing goes wrong within this period the society first 'clean' the uncommon region from any more variables like the Faceless Ancient.Only then they would widen their search toward other lands of common plains.If even after then, they couldn't find the faceless ancient, then it meant that guy was far more capable than they thought and probably fled their detection.However, at that time, even if Faceless Ancient alerted someone about their movement in this place, they would've already achieved their goal before anyone would take it seriously.After all, this place was a barren area, and no one cared much about it as long as it didn't affect them directly.A-10000 watch a small pile of titan iron being processed into titan tears and smile, 'This is the last pile of titan iron present in this place, and this much titan tear is enough for the remaining first-generation cannibal to reach their peak and capability of reproduction.'Afterwards, I just have to pay a visit to the rare region and make intermediate common grade Titan Tears. It would make the progress faster, and we'll leave this place before anyone found out what we were doing…'"Boomm…."Right at this moment, the closed door of the building blasted apart by a powerful force, startling everyone present."Who?!" A-10000's expression fell, and growled in rage, "Who dares to barge in, and what are those thralls doing outside, fucking each other?!"At this moment, a figure appeared extremely fast wearing a long black jacket with a hood, and started killing the trolls with a single punch by blasting their heads into bits!The moment A-10000 saw this figure and the outfit, his expression changed. When the hooded figure looked toward his direction, A-10000's eyes dilated, and his heart trembled when he saw that faceless black mask that had left a ghastly impression on him recently.'Faceless Ancient. He's here for revenge!'This abrupt thought surfaced in his mind, and without hesitation, he picked up the glass jar and ran toward the rear exit, and blasted the door with his body.He was completely appalled by Faceless Ancient appearing here suddenly, and from his appearance, it didn't seem he was here for a friendly visit.Moreover, A-9999 wasn't here to protect him either, so he had no choice but to run in the direction of the mines and hope those trolls could keep that guy occupied until he was deep within the mine's maze.Those troll guards were already charging toward the building with bloodshot eyes to deal with this unexpected intruder, and A-10000 knew it was the only chance of survival.Afterward, he just has to wait for A-9999 arrival and then call for those senior members sent by the society."Just wait, once those three arrive, I'll skin you alive!" He mumbled maliciously."Is that so?"However, a nonchalant voice filled with ridicule made A-10000's heart palpitate because it was a very familiar voice.Right at this moment, before A-10000 could react, a powerful fist struck behind his head, and which was akin to a sledgehammer, he felt a piercing pain before everything turned into darkness.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ The jar of titan tears also fell from his hand, but before it could land on the ground, a hand grabbed it."I'll take this gift." The jar suddenly vanished from this person's hand.This attacker was naturally Jacob in his usual black outfit and his faceless black mask.After he left the tyrant mansion a few days ago with Harrison. He headed directly into the earthen kingdom to find the traces of A-10000 and A-9999 and it wasn't hard to find them either.Because it was quite clear that the Earthen Kingdom was controlled by the Killer Skull Society, which also means the royal family was under their control. So, all Jacob did was observe the royal castle, and it didn't take long before he noticed the unusual behavior of the royal family.In the end, those trolls led him right to the prime minister, who also happened to be the same troll he encountered in the lion forest's underground lab. He easily identified him with his voice.Afterward, Jacob just had to torture that fellow, and he told him about the whereabouts of A-10000 and A-9999 as well as what they were doing with those mutants.However, he only knew those mutants were called cannibals by the Killer Skull Society and that they were part of the Cannibal Plan. As for the very goal of the cannibal plan, that troll didn't know, but he knows those mutants were extremely important to the cannibal plan.But Jacob was little interested in this cannibal plan. He was here to collect some special hearts and blood.So, he dealt with the prime minister and destroyed those parasite gem controllers, which would either kill those victims or make them vegetables. It would throw the entire Earthen Kingdom into chaos, which was just what he wanted.Afterward, he directly came here to abduct A-10000 and gained some more information about A-9999 and the other members sent here by the society to deal with him.More importantly, he wanted A-10000's heart and blood, which was a peak common tier-12, and it would give Jacob an enormous boost in his strength.Jacob's entire plan was very simple from the moment he met with A-10000 and A-9999. He wanted to kill them both for their hearts and blood, especially A-9999, who was a Rare Tier-1.Because once he absorbed these two, he would get a huge percentage in his heart's progress, which would normally take him many years and many more hearts and blood.So, he decided to remain in the uncommon region as a human and see if he could really kill them and those sent after him by society.Not only that, but he was planning on killing more species who were sent here by the three hegemonies after the humans alerted them with the information he provided that day.He was going to keep killing while the blame would fall on the Killer Skull Society, and the society might suspect him first, but then they would have no choice but to turn their focus on the others since his prowess couldn't advance so much within this short period of time.Even if they suspected him, they would have those enrage organizations to deal with first.Although his plan was crazy, reckless even. But as long as he didn't leave behind any proof, who could blame it on him?He was going to devour everything, much less leave anything behind as proof. He was going to turn this uncommon region into his hunting group until he was satisfied!As for the natives, he cared less even if they were all exterminated in the crossfire between all these organizations.At this moment, a figure approached Jacob at a fast speed before he halted his step just a meter away from him. He was dressed just like Jacob and wore the same mask; it was none other than Harrison!Jacob was using Harrison as bait to see if A-9999 was here or not. In the end, she wasn't, so he acted before A-10000 could escape.Poor Harrison did not know about it, nor Jacob was planning on telling him.In Harrison's eyes, they were cleaning trolls, and Jacob was nurturing his fighting skills by letting him take the lead.Jacob told Harrison, who looked at the unconscious cloaked A-10000 curiously,"Pick him up. We're going back!"

Chapter 144 Common Tier-12 Heart Essence
﻿Inside a cavern a few miles away in the forbidden forest,Jacob had Harrison put the still unconscious A-10000 on the floor and then tell him, "Go and wipe out every troll in this forest and then patrol this area. If anyone approached, kill them without asking. Here's your reward. You did well. Now go."He tossed a small vial filled with black liquid toward Harrison, who quickly caught it with shining eyes and bowed, "Thank you, My Lord, I won't disappoint you!" He then quickly left to complete this mission given by Jacob.Jacob's eyes shimmered with a peculiar glint as he watched excited Harrison leave to hunt trolls and maybe absorb the black liquid as well to increase his strength.But all Jacob actually wanted was to send him away since he didn't want to let anyone see what he was about to do with A-10000, and sending Harrison in the open was also another part of his plan.Jacob started a fire. Everything was prepared, even his newly built distillation equipment, which was smaller than the old one but more advanced. In his time in his privately built gunsmith workshop, Jacob prepared everything before coming here.He knew he didn't have time to waste if he wanted to hunt down powerful members sent here by the Killer Skull Society and the three hegemonies. He needed to raise his strength with every hunt!Jacob chose this spot because this was well hidden and it was closer to the earthen kingdom's capital.After Jacob was done with the fire, he moved toward the A-10000 with his sharp short sword in his hand."Let's walk you up."The next moment, Jacob slashed his sword at A-10000's legs…"Ahhhhhhh…" A-10000 abruptly opened his eyes wide and shrill screamed at top of his lungs. He looked at his cleaved legs with an aghast look in his bloodshot eyes."If you don't stop screaming, I'll cut your hand next." Jacob's nonchalant, yet perplexed, a voice rang. But how could A-10000 stop screaming with that horrifying pain in his legs which nearly drives him insane? But with his strong willpower, he still managed to suppress it and felt sluggish with all that blood overflowing.Jacob spoke again, "I just want to know where is the Dark Elf and when she will come back. As well as who are the other three people you were mumbling about, as well as where are they right now, and what is their strength? If your answer satisfied me, I'll kill you without any pain, or I'll throw you in that fire and cook you alive."A-10000 looked at Jacob with an appalled look in his eyes, but he knew death was inevitable, so he conveyed with some difficulty, "S-she's in a secret lab behind a waterfall in the west of Silver Wood Forest of Aureate Kingdom… conducting experiments… on cannibals. She would come to… collect… titan tears in two days…"The information about three seniors is only known by A-9999, and I only know one of them is a three digits skull which could only mean a Rare-Tier-6… species!"N-Now, kill me, and I'll wait for you on the other side!" A-10000 looked at Jacob with madness and hatred as if he won't be able to live this time.Jacob, however, remained expressionless and nodded. "You might have to wait forever on that side since I won't be coming there… ever…"The next moment, Jacob's sword turned in a dark streak and flashed through A-10000's neck, cleaving it clean. He gave him a painless death.When A-10000's head rolled on the ground, the mask on his face fell, and a lion-like face with slightly human features appeared.'Lion Head Orc indeed.' Jacob remembered the appearance of this specie since he won't get anything out of them in the future.Without delay, he cut open A-10000's chest, and pull out his heart, and then started the distillation process. He knew his time was short and needed to raise his power before hunting A-9999 down.Because it would still take some time before she noticed the situation in the Earthen Kingdom and came looking for what happened. He won't completely believe the time frame of two days A-10000 given him.He then skinned A-10000's body, and he decided to keep his skin to make a vest since it was sturdier than his tiger's bull hide. Soon, gutted A-10000 was skewered on top of the fire, and it would be ready for eating with the heart essence.Jacob smiled contentedly when he saw both high-tier meat and heart essence getting ready, and he felt his decision of staying was indeed right."Cursed Immortality!"The last time he summoned Immortika was when he inquired about A-10000 and A-9999's species and ranks.The moment it appeared, he saw a string of 'Haha' and instantly felt perplexed.Jacob ignored its delirious laugh and asked, "How much percentage will this Common Tier-12 will give me and then Rare Tier-1?"Jacob wanted to be ready in case the percentage was much greater than his titan tears' supply.Right now, with his own jar and the jar he got from A-10000, he had over eight thought drops of titan tears, which were enough to sustain all the way up to 100%.Because last time, at the fifty percent completion rate, one drop of titan tear quenched his hunger by 1%. If at 60% it took two drops at one percent or even three drops at 1% percent, and if he added the meat of corresponding quality then achieving a 100% heart process without any hitch should be possible.Immortika replied, "Hahaha… and here I thought you would run away from this golden opportunity, but you didn't disappoint me at all. So, as a reward, I'll tell you, this Lion Head Orc will add approximately 16% or 19% to your current progress rate."This will take you 68% or directly to 70%. Then, if you hunt that dark elf, she should be able to give you over 20% progress rate. But as a fair warning, if you inject a Rare Specie Heart Essence, the heart essence of Common Tier Species will no longer have any effect on you."This means, you will have to complete the reaming percentage with another rare tier species. But I guess it didn't matter anymore since more prey had arrived… hahahaha…"Jacob's eyes shimmered with glee when he read this, and can't help but state, "What if I absorbed the mutants' heart essence first and then the Dark Elf's will it affect the percentage of her heart essence?""The effect of her heart essence will decrease by 5% every time you cross a ten percent limit."Furthermore, if those mutants were created with the same method and genes, simply put, if those mutants were created with lets supposed humans and hob trolls, then after you absorbed one of their heart essences, the other mutants with the same gene structure won't work on you anymore."But if these clowns created mutants with unique combinations, then they might work. Besides, after you absorb this lion head orc's heart essence, the effect of Common Tier-9 or below will only give you three or four percent maximum."So, I suggest not wasting more time and stop being a worrywart. After you reach a 90% completion rate, your strength should be around Rare-Tier-4 or 5, and if you add 9X fluid acceleration in the mix, you can crush a Rare-Tier 9 like crushing an ant!"Jacob's eyes narrowed when he read this, and won't help but think about what Immortika just suggested seriously. But the problem was he wasn't confident in controlling even 3X acceleration, much less 9X. His limit was 2X.'Well, I'll think of it after I reached 90%. I would get enough information from the Dark Elf, and if I can really hunt someone from that group, I won't hesitate. This way, I could leave much sooner without risking my life,' Jacob mused.This new revelation opened more paths in front of Jacob, and he discovered he didn't even need to sow discord anymore.Nevertheless, he still didn't know what kind of step arrived after he completed the second level of cursed heart emergence, so it was better to be on guard.After a few hours, the heart essence was complete, and the meat was cooked.Without further delay, Jacob injected the warm heart essence of a Common-Tier-12 species.The moment the heart essence simmered in his heart, the heart rate suddenly started to increase, and he felt his blood turn scorching hot.Within seconds, Jacob was already on the verge of entering 1X acceleration. He quickly tried to meditate to calm his nerves, which was extremely painful and difficult.But he knew better than anyone that if he didn't take control, it would be extremely dangerous if his heart rate kept rising without any restraint.However, he had underestimated a common tier-12 specie's heart essence, and he entered the 1X acceleration in five minutes and his heart rate was still climbing!

Chapter 145 Enemy Alert
﻿Although entering the 1X acceleration brought Jacob danger, it also unexpectedly hastened the process of the heart essence's absorption.It brought Jacob pain, but he could feel the power coursing through his body with every passing second.The 1-cm infinity Curse Marked within Jacob's heart suddenly stirred and start expanding little by little.This process hastened, even more, when Jacob entered the 2X acceleration after ten minutes of endurance.However, Jacob could feel the process was almost over and was completely focused on calming his heart rate.The cursed mark also finally stopped when it expanded 1-inch from 1 cm, and the blurry pattern within the infinity symbol also became apparent despite their blurry state, they were two symbols, 'o' and 'x'!Jacob also felt a strange energy released within his bloodstream from his heart, and without any effort, his heart rate suddenly dropped until it returned to its normal state and harmonious."What just happened?" Jacob opened his eyes in bewilderment as he looked at the cursed immortality which was still hovering in front of him. There were still over ten minutes until his daily limit of summoning reached its end.He opened the progress page._______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 70.01%.…_______'So, I do cross two limits at once, again.' Jacob was delighted as that strange energy was still coursing through his body, making him feel like he was in a hot spring.At this moment, the writing in the book changed, which was clearly Immortika's doing."You should wolf that potion while you still had the chance… heheheh…"Jacob's eyes dilated and didn't hesitate. He took out the jar he got from A-10000 and drink two mouthfuls of titan tears.Although he didn't know why Immortika had written those words, he didn't dare to ignore it. Because he knew this delirious book would never lie.Just as the titan tears entered his body, Jacob felt his skin stiffening before he looked at his hands. He was shocked when he saw them visibly getting skinnier until his skin was tightly wrapped around his bonds and nerves.It was like there weren't any meats in his body.He finally understood what Immortika meant by that warning.It was a side effect of fluid acceleration and hunger of 70%.Jacob just burned a huge amount of energy, so it was only normal for his body to burn his muscles for that energy, and if he didn't react in time, he might've fallen unconscious because of exhaustion.Simply put, he could've died if he didn't consume the titian tears to appease the burden on his body."Sometimes, I wonder if you're supposed to lead me to immortality or sudden death." Jacob's hoarse voice sound filled with indignant."Hahahaha… I told you the way to immortality isn't easy as you think it is. You can die when you think you're the safest. It's just a matter of simple omission."Jacob didn't refute and closed the annoying book, but deep down, he was still feeling grateful since Immortika just saved him. But he won't say it unless he wanted to make it more annoying.Because of the titan tears, his energy was 10% replenished while hunger was also gone by 5%. But he started feeling dizzy and quickly gulped down two more mouths full of titan tears before he moved toward the cooked A-10000.Although Jacob now looked like skin and bones, if he unleashed his prowess, he was ten times stronger than half an hour ago.Jacob starts eating without any restraint. He was so immersed in it that he unknowingly started crunching a common tier-12 species' bones like it was a cracker.The strangest thing was Jacob found it quite flavorful, and no longer cared about bones or meat and ate everything without spitting out anything like a savage.As he eats, his body quickly absorbs the nutrition, and he finally regains some meat over his bones.In the end, his hunger was 65% decreased while he was still skinny and needed more common tier-12 meat to regain his masculine physique.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Nevertheless, Jacob was now out of danger and more powerful than ever. He drinks one liter more titan tears to quench his reaming hunger and finally felt the full power of his 70% synchronization body with his heart.'The titan tears of this quality are only enough up to 90%, or it might exhaust at 80% since the hunger will increase.' Jacob frowned as he again had a deeper understanding of his own condition.Before, he thought this many titan tears were enough until he reached 100%, but now that he experienced hunger and energy consumption after entering 70%, he was no longer delusional.He required that second titan tears elixir, and to make it he required to go into the rare or even rarer region.'Well, if I killed the dark elf and those three other members sent here by killer skull society, I might enter 100% without any problem.' Jacob's eyes shimmered with dark light.He then closed his eyes to rest for a while because his next target was A-9999!---However, Jacob did not know that the moment he killed A-10000 a signal was emitted from his brain, and within 24 hours, the Killer Skull Society was alerted, and another emergency meeting was called out.As a result,Inside a spacious stone room, many pieces of lab equipment were placed neatly while there were three glass cells filled with green liquid, and inside those cells were three gray humanoid monsters, slumbering.On a side, a curvaceous figure with long black hair was standing while holding a book and pen in front of another gray monster on a metal stretcher. But the difference was this humanoid monster's entire torso skin was removed, and its organs were visible in front of this figure.At this moment, the silver wristband on her wrist suddenly vibrates, breaking her focus. Her beautiful crimson eyes narrowed before she pressed on that silver wristband.The calm expression on her breathtaking, beautiful, ebony face suddenly crumbled as her eyes dilated when she read the message on her star watch."Skull No. A-10000 had been killed, and the culprit might be the mysterious Faceless Ancient. Stop doing everything and rendezvous with Skull NO. A-995's team and get rid of the variable as soon as possible. Failure won't be acceptable!"This was the entire content of the message.A-9999's eyes shimmered with killing intent as her red lips curled into a strange smile. "So, you still didn't leave, huh? Although I don't know what your end goal is by coming back and daring to hinder our plan, you won't survive this time, though…"---Somewhere in the rainy mountain ranges,A-995 was walking with his small beanpole in his hand while holding an active scanner in his other hand.Yet, at this moment, his black Star Watch suddenly vibrates."Hmm?" He was startled for a moment before he opened the message. It was the same message as A-9999.He coldly sneered, "That maggot is courting death."He tapped the white beanpole in his hand in anger at the group, and the next moment a slight earthquake jolted the area around A-995 and blasted some trees close to him into smithereens!---Jacob did not know that he had been discovered by the Killer Skull Society, and currently, all four members present in the uncommon region were coming toward the earthen kingdom to find him!Today, he left the cavern and found Harrison, who was a few hundred meters away from his location.Harrison had already gotten rid of every troll in the forbidden forest, and as per Jacob's order, he was keeping an eye out for intruders, so no one would disturb Jacob.After getting more black liquid, Harrison was even more confident and wanted to earn more black liquid, so he was doing his duty sincerely.When Jacob appeared while holding a three-meter-long bag, he felt Jacob was somewhat slimmer than the last time he saw him, but doesn't question him, neither he asks what Jacob did with that 'troll'.Jacob looked at Harrison, whose build was just like the past him, and said, "Let's go back to the mines. I acquired the information from that 'troll' that the secret agent who wanted to harm humanity will come in a day or two."So, I want you to confront that agent. But I'm warning you, his strength might be A-rank. Are you ready to go into the last phase of your training? If you last five minutes against that agent, it'll prove your abilities, and I'll give you enough black liquid to enter A-rank."As for danger, you don't have to worry about it since I'll be watching your back." Jacob confidently declared like a teacher to his student.Harrison's eyes glowed with resolution when he listened to this. He was moved by Jacob's care. He finally 'understands' Jacob was nurturing him as his personal student and teaching him the way of a hero.Harrison thumped his chest with extreme confidence, "I'll do as my lord command and get rid of the vile villain!"

Chapter 146 Who Trapped Who? (1)
﻿On the periphery of the Earthen Kingdom,Inside a small cave, four capped figures were gathering here, three tall and one short, spotting himself with a beanpole."So, according to your scout, that Maggot is still in this forbidden forest's facility close to the titan iron mines?" A-995 sharply questioned."Yes, I have made a parasite slave and have him scout the capital city of the earthen kingdom and the forbidden forest to see the conditions there. I didn't dare to go myself, since it might alert the enemy if he was still there."Anyhow, the scout brought back grave news. Not only the killer of A-10000 rendered the entire royal family cripple and left the kingdom in chaos. It's clear he isn't aware that we already knew about his presence."So, he was probably planning to draw me in with this chaos. I think A-10000 might've revealed that I'll come back in a few days to pick up Titan Tears so he could escape torture."My scout had spotted him close to the mine setting up some traps, so I'm sure of it, he wanted to kill me as well." A-9999 respectfully replied, her arrogance was nothing in front of this small person, and she even feared him!A-995 sneered coldly, "What an arrogant maggot. It seemed he might've contacted his superiors, and they wanted him to hinder our plan until they sent someone else as a backup."Or he's just a greedy native and here for more titan tears so he could increase his strength to a higher level, or there's also a possibility he wanted to capture you to gain our attention and then negotiate with us his freedom."There are other possibilities, but whichever his motive is, we'll just have to capture him to found about it."Since he wanted to reel you in his trap, let used this trap to reel him into our trap instead. He probably won't have the technology of our caliber, and we're already prepared, so there's no need to be afraid of this bumpkin maggot!"Let's start at dawn and capture ourselves a maggot!" A-995 declared!"Yes!" the three of them replied in unison.---At dawn,Harrison, dressing as Jacob, was sitting calmly a few meters away from the bloody building where he massacred trolls three days ago.Jacob had told him to wait here like this without any fear of any bullets or ambush until the 'agent' arrived and he had a match with him.However, he had also set up many traps around to weaken his opponent by Jacob's order yesterday.He was extremely confident in dealing with the 'agent' now and then winning himself a ticket to A rank.After tasting the power, his previous belief crumbled, replacing new beliefs which were simple; power is equal to rule. He started longing for more power, and that's why he was willing to do anything to gain it.Right now, he knew he could only gain power by following Jacob, and after following him to the Earthen Kingdom, he discovered Jacob was quite 'noble' despite his tyrannical image.He had crushed the noble family of trolls, which was the biggest threat to humanity, and then this lab, which was also a threat to humanity, and now he was going to kill the mastermind behind the war.Although Harrison admires Jacob's 'nobility', he doesn't agree with Jacob's method because he does it for 'free' and without anyone knowing it.He didn't know why Jacob didn't want to tell everyone that he has gotten rid of such a huge threat alone, but he doesn't dare to ask because he didn't want to give Jacob the impression that he had changed from the past and now harbor ambition.He was afraid Jacob would stop 'nurturing' him and won't pass on his secret to that dark liquid to him.Jacob was extremely strong so, overpowering him for that black liquid was akin to court death. So, he decided to act just as Jacob wanted and win him over.The more Harrison becomes obedient, the more thing Jacob gave him. Just like that green liquid that can quench his hunger and thirst, it was miraculous. So, he acted more submissively.He also believed that Jacob wouldn't let him die after nurturing him to this stage!At this moment, Harrison snapped out of his thoughts when his ears picked up faint footsteps quickly approaching him. His hearing also increased after he entered the B-rank, so he instantly became alert.Five hundred meters away from Harrison's position, on a large three, a figure sat wearing a hood. In front of him was a three meters long heavy sniper rifle, completely black, resting on its stands on a thick tree branch.Just the barrel of this rifle was alone two meters long, and a long scope was on top of it. The person was calmly looking through the scope toward Harrison and all the clear mining areas.This person was naturally Jacob, who was prepared to kill A-9999 with his newly built titan sniper!After Jacob used his knowledge to modify the titan sniper and created special bullets, he called it the Friction Killer. He brings some materials from the dark city that made it possible to complete this new titan sniper and bullets.Jacob was quite confident in this new sniper rifle because it could now shoot bullets at Mach-10 speed!However, with such speed, the rifle will be blasted apart after six shots, so to be safe, Jacob kept the limit to three or four rounds. As long as A-9999 didn't have an energy shield that could activate before the bullet blew her head, she was dead the moment Jacob pulled the trigger!However, Jacob was completely vigilant because yesterday he found a troll loitering around the vicinity of mines. Harrison didn't notice him since it was quite proficient in hiding its footsteps sound, but how could Jacob miss him with his current hearing?But he didn't kill that person and let him go after he scouted Harrison. He wanted to draw A-9999 in open, and if that scout was hers; he didn't mind revealing that he was there. Because in Jacob's thought A-9999 still didn't know A-10000 was dead, and she might think he was holding him, hostage, so she will come out to test his motives.That was why he didn't leave the earthen kingdom after thinking about the other three skulls in the uncommon region as well.If A-9999 alerted the other threes and have them come here to overpower Jacob, they will still have to come in the open, and this was a chance he won't be going to miss!Even if she came alone after overestimating Jacob and misunderstanding his motives, Jacob would still kill her and then hunt those three skulls down after raising his prowess.In any case, Jacob mused, he didn't have to do much if he played his cards well and used Harrison as a perfect bait.That guy had no idea what he was getting into, and he was completely blinded by benefits, and took Jacob for a kind, noble person, while the reality was completely different.Jacob had long known about Harrison's change in nature at the tyrant mansion. He also sensed Harrison's ambition increasing, but Jacob doesn't stop him at all, and even encourages it and then manipulates the old guy with his own ambition.From the start, Jacob was growing Harrison into a perfect bait that would be hard to not get noticed by a big fish.'If that scout was sent by the dark elf. He had notified her that Harrison was setting up traps when he saw him, so she would be even more confident in approaching him while thinking she was completely prepared.' Jacob's lips curled into an astute smile as he heard faint footsteps from his position. 'She's deliberately making her footsteps loud enough to be noticed by me. She came prepared!'How could someone like A-9999 make the rookie mistake of not hiding her footsteps?Jacob knew if he wanted; Harrison won't even notice him before he slit his throat, so he guessed A-9999 really wanted to have a negotiation with him, or she was bait sent by the other three.Whatever the case was, Jacob wanted A-9999 heart and blood!At this moment, a capped figure appeared within the woods as it moved slowly toward Harrison, who had already stood up as his eyes shone with confidence.This capped figure stopped fifty meters away from Harrison since the trap field was ahead.A-9999's jeering yet coquettish voice sounded, "So, my dear Faceless Ancient, care to explain why you came back? Could it be you missed me?"If you hadn't killed A-10000 I would've let you spend a night or two with me, but now that you did, you will still spend nights with me, albeit not in the pleasure chamber, but in the torture chamber!"Harrison was baffled by these words and looked at the capped figure in confusion. 'Is she pretending to be an idiot to lure me out of the trap field?'However, Jacob, who had heard everything, clearly felt his heart turn cold, 'They knew I killed that lion-head orc? But how!?'

Chapter 147 Who Trapped Who? (2)
﻿Jacob instantly felt something was wrong.Because only he and Harrison knew that he killed A-10000, but for some reason, A-9999 also knew!Which could only mean one thing: 'Could it be some device in their body that could alert others at the moment of their death? I was just wondering how they could tell Jerry was dead, but I thought it was just because they were monitoring him.'But it turned out I was looking at it in the wrong way all along, their technology is far more advanced and unpredictable.' Jacob's expressions were grave, 'Then this could also mean the other three members are here as well and they knew about my plan to draw them here.'Jacob looked at A-9999 with an icy glare and he felt there was something wrong with her and then it accrued to him, 'Fuck, she can feel the danger from me, but it shouldn't be possible with 50 meters distance.'Should I kill her or wait and see why she was stalling? But that idiot might jump the gun too soon and give me away. I have a chance to kill her now. But what if the other three are planning something and they had more advanced trackers to track me down?'The moment I kill her, I won't get the chance to retrieve her body before the other threes will charge in this direction, one of them might already be somewhere here already.' Jacob felt like he shouldn't take the shoot and wait to see what these four were planning.He was hidden completely, and his breathing and heartbeat were almost none existed.'I should wait before the strongest between them appeared and kill that person to get rid of that danger,' Jacob decided and waited.Because right now, exposing him was not a good thing since they already knew he killed A-10000 they won't be here just to talk with him but to eliminate or capture him for information.So, he would see what they were truly planning, and if the others showed themselves, only then he would risk exposing himself.Harrison looked at A-9999 fifty meters away and couldn't help but sneered coldly, "Are you going to use your mouth to defeat me?"A-9999 suddenly felt that this voice was somewhat different. She can only feel danger from Jacob when she were only twenty meters away from him. Right now, she can't tell if this is the real person or not.However, when she looked at the mask and stature, she thought it was indeed Jacob. She would never forget his physical appearance, and that person also seemed to be quite confident and gave an air of arrogance, which means he couldn't be an impersonator. He was extremely confident in his prowess.'Why am I even worried? I just have to capture him to see if he is real, or not and if he is indeed an imposter, then the real one will be here somewhere, lying in ambush. If he thinks he can trick me with these traps, then he's already dead.' She thought and finally took out something from within her cape.It was a palm-size red chrome ball, and she suddenly pressed her thumb on its smooth surface before it glowed and then, "Here's a meeting gift." She sneered before throwing it toward Harrison.Harrison was shocked, and before he could react, the red ball was already only an inch away from him. The next moment, it suddenly exploded in red liquid and engulfed him before he could react.The red liquid completely wrapped around Harrison like rubber, and then before he knew it, he had turned into a red manikin, and he struggled to come out of this rubber substance.A-9999 eyes narrowed as she mumbled, "It was too easy." She knew if it was, she could've dodged it, but this guy didn't even react in time. It was just a probe, but it was already over.She knew it was a fake!She suddenly shouted, "It's a fake! Stop focusing your scanners in this area and…""Wisss… splash…" A-9999's head suddenly blew into bits like a watermelon before she could even react, or anyone else, as a matter of fact. She died without even feeling anything, and the trees behind her also blasted in a long line with this bullet!"Bang…"A sonic boom sounded in the vicinity at this moment when A-9999's headless corpse touched the ground, and a dark brown energy barrier appeared this time on her body.The bullet was so fast that it hit the mark before making any sound or giving the enemy a chance to activate their shield!"W-what just happened?" A cloaked figure two hundred meters away from A-9999's corpse holding a scanner mumbled in bewilderment, without even realizing it.However, making a sound was the biggest mistake he does, which was enough to be heard by Jacob, who had already entered 1X acceleration, and his hearing was double that of before.The next moment, 'Bang.' The head of this cloaked figure was also blasted into bits, and he died just like A-9999, clueless and without even realizing it.'Boom'Another sonic boom rang in the vicinity.Jacob loaded another bullet, which was 1 foot in size. Its bullet head was black and only three inches long, while the shell was white and 9 inches in size.He was completely focused while holding his breath, and his acceleration was still at 1X.The moment he saw Harrison getting trapped in that strange red liquid, he knew it was impossible to draw others, and they will know Harrison was a fake. He never thought even a bait would have to be on the same level as the prey.Nevertheless, he decided to act and took the shot at A-9999 without hesitating anymore because dealing with three was much better than four.He also activated his 1X acceleration, increasing his hearing sense. He knew the other three will make some kind of mistake after A-9999's uncanny death.And he was right. Her death was so shocking that one of them even uttered words that were enough to give Jacob his location, and he took the shot.To not get affected by the sound, Jacob had prepared special noise-canceling earbuds, and before the sound was made, he would put them in his ears or he would harm himself with this ear-piercing sound wave.'Two more!' Jacob's heart was beating wildly, and he entered 2x stage at this moment, and his hearing raised again. At this moment, the barrel of this sniper was red with heat, and a faint crack could be seen on the tip.Nevertheless, Jacob didn't care, and at this moment.'Ss…'A tiny sound entered Jacob's ears of some dry leaves getting crushed in the three-hundred-meter southwest direction. The other party was clearly much calmer and trying to escape the vicinity while moving within the shades of trees so he won't get hit by a bullet.However, Jacob was prepared for this and pointed his rifle in the escapee's direction. After making sure about the direction, he pulled the trigger before two dark earbuds appeared in his ears.The bullet blasted some trees in its way and then landed on a shadow that just stepped in the bullet's direction and shattered the dark brown barrier like glass before piercing through his spine and blasting apart his stomach!'Boom…'Jacob saw the cracks in the barrier and the sniper's body appearing, but he loaded another bullet without caring about it. Only a single person left. He was close to killing all four high-ranking skulls and acquiring enough hearts to enter 100%!Right at this moment, an enraged voice sounded filled with malice, "Sneaky Maggot, die! Earth Shatter!"Jacob was shocked when he heard this voice. It came from over fifty meters behind him. It meant this person had snuck up on him despite his hearing, and he still couldn't detect his presence, as if he didn't have a heartbeat or breathing.Yet, he didn't have time to think about it because the ground beneath the tree where he was hiding suddenly started to crack as if an extremely strong earthquake had just appeared.Jacob didn't hesitate, picked up the rifle, and quickly jumped toward the other tree, but the area of this sudden earthquake was fifty meters, and the ground was shattering apart.So, Jacob didn't have time to think as he was bussing running this area.However, that malicious voice rang again. "Do you think you can escape after killing my people? Earth Spikes!"Before Jacob could find the location of this voice, magically sharp spikes rose from the shattering group and quickly approached Jacob's potion.Jacob's heart palpitated as he understood something. 'Magic, this is fucking magic!'He never thought he would get the chance to experience fabled magic firsthand. It was unexpected, and he didn't have time to admire it because he was in an extremely dangerous situation now."Cursed immortality!"Tell me, what is this species and where is his position?"He knew this person was hiding his traces extremely well, and even with his hearing; it was impossible to locate him.So Immortika was his only hope!

Chapter 148 Magic Core?!
﻿"Cursed immortality!"Tell me, what is this species and where is his position?"Jacob quickly questioned while dodging the incoming spikes with difficulty. But he was spooked because he didn't know what kind of trick the other party had since now magic was involved."It's a Rare-Tier-5 Earth Goblin with 1-Star Initial-level Earth Element Affinity and Power! He's at your 7 o'clock hiding underground, ten meters deep. You have hit a jackpot if you could acquire its heart! Hahahaha…"Jacob ignored the last line and pointed his rifle when Immortika pointed and pulled the trigger!"How…" A panicked voice sounded when Jacob pointed his gun in the same direction, and before he could react, the bullet was already fired.Jacob felt the entire titan sniper boiling, and without even thinking, he threw it away…"Booommmm…."With the gunshot sound, the sniper rifle also blasted apart, and Jacob was naturally within the blasting range as well, but he threw it before it was blasted so he only suffered with shockwave and some metal debris piercing his skin which wasn't a big deal.But he also lost his balance and was sent flying and landed between trees.However, Jacob didn't have time to lie down since his heart was already at the 3x stage of acceleration, and he still didn't know if that goblin was dead. But when he saw the ground stop shaking, and no more spikes came out, he sighed in relief but made sure he looked toward Immortika.But he was shocked when he saw…"Idiot, what are you looking for? Go and dig that goblin out. He had the material you needed for the last level of Cursed Heart Emergence. If you leave him underground for half an hour, you'll lose that material!"Jacob was startled and didn't dare to hesitate, and quickly sprang into action before drinking a mouthful of titan tears. He quickly discovered the bullet hole in the ground and quickly dug along the bullet line.Digging wasn't hard for him with his current prowess, so it didn't take long before he was ten-meter-deep into the group and suddenly dug into a small opening in the ground.He saw a small figure laying there in its own blood and gore as the bullet blasted apart its entire right chest as well as he spotted a small beanpole in its mutilated right hand.Jacob didn't have time before he took a heart box and started filling it with its blood, and he thanked his luck that the heart was intact, so he quickly placed the heart in the box as well.Only then, "Now, what is this material you spoke of?" he questioned impatiently.There were three more bodies he required to collect hearts and blood from, laying outside, and if he was late, the blood might run out or go bad, so he was in a hurry."Relax, just this heart is enough to let you complete the 100% cursed mark, so you need no more hearts. Just eat them all to quench your hunger. As for the material I'm talking about, just open its stomach, and you'll know what I'm talking about."Jacob was ecstatic when he heard he didn't need to collect those damn hearts anymore, so he was more relaxed, but he was still under 3X acceleration, so he needed to calm himself down.Afterward, Jacob cut open the earth goblin, who looks just like a typical gibing with a sharp long nose, long ears, and long teeth. The difference was there was a green mark between his eyebrows.The moment he opened the goblin's stomach, Jacob was shocked because something was glowing in the greenish light, and he instantly understood what he was looking for.Without caring about the mess, he took out the glowing thing from Earth Goblin's stomach. It was connected with a strange green membrane, but the moment Jacob touched it the membrane burst like a bubble, and a two-inches shining green stone appeared in Jacob's bloody hand."What is this?" Jacob was astonished as he looked at the shining stone, which was smooth and warm to the touch."Hehehe, it's a 1-Star Initial Earth Element Core, or you can call it a magic core. Once you complete the cursed mark, I'll give a proper explanation of Magic and what this core is used for. Just store it in the infinity pendant for now, or it'll evaporate in the air in a few minutes, and you have no place to cry."'A magic core?' Jacob was shocked and didn't dare to be careless with this thing and store it away.Afterward, Jacob collected the small staff, which was probably a magic wand in his eyes, and stored it away as well. He was going to check it later. He then picked up the goblin's body, which was his nutrition, and headed toward the other three to pick up their bodies and equipment as well.When he reached where A-9999 had died, he looked at Harrison, who was probably choked to death in that red liquid and didn't care about him, and picked up A-9999's headless body as well.He quickly collected the other two bodies and stored small pieces of equipment in his pendant.From Immortika, he found that the other two deceased were a 'Rare-Tier-2 Orc and a Rare-Tier-4 Troll.'Jacob then left the area, leaving behind the mess for others. He was going back to his man cave to start the distillation and grilling process as soon as possible.After encountering a magic user, he knew just how dangerous they were, and even with his powerful body, it wasn't certain that he could win against them. If not for the newly built titan iron, he would have never been able to kill all four of them. Especially the Earth Goblin who only died because of Immortika's help, and without it, Jacob would be forced to flee.Since it's going to be his last injection, Jacob put all three bodies of 'nutrition' on three skewers and finally has the time to deal with the 3X acceleration.He had already lost the little bit of meat he had put on the other day and returned to being skinny again. He drank another mouthful of titian tears before he closed his eyes and starts meditating to calm his heart rate.After half an hour, Jacob finally managed to make his heart rate calm and break the meditation. He looked at bonny limbs and smiled wryly. 'I still have a long way to go before I will be able to exit 3X acceleration without going into a mediation state. The energy consumption is just too great.'After lamenting about his ability, Jacob finally looked at the small pile of equipment he collected from those four and moved toward them.There was only two intact full-body armor, one was from the troll while one was a female armor from A-9999. These armors were made with special materials and were much stronger than anything Jacob had seen in this place.But his friction-killer bullet still pierced these armors, the armors worn by Earth Goblin and Orc were proof of it.Nevertheless, these armors were still better than what Jacob currently had, and he could wear the troll's armor under his long jacket.Then there were two more of the red liquid explosives he got from A-9999, and there was also a device that was some kind of scanner and radar.She was also caring a pair of silver guns, which were clearly far more advanced than common plains guns.Then there was a dark green energy shield belt which was much stronger than Jacob's.The troll and orc were carrying cold weapons, a long sword, two battle axes, and two automatic guns. Everything was high quality.Jacob also found some explosives and flash grenades. He also got two more scanners that had the same functions as the one A-9999 was carrying.But when he fiddles with those two scanners, he found a virtual map of the uncommon region, there were two marked places on them.'Could it be their hideouts? Where they stored their other equipment as well as the research data from mutants? It's quite possible since they weren't carrying any large firearms, and they were only here to capture me.'If they had come prepared and wanted to just kill me, I don't think they didn't have sniper rifles in their place. Or these could be just their labs. Nevertheless, I should check them. I might find something useful,' Jacob mused as he stowed away the scanners.Even without this map, just their other functions made them priceless in Jacob's eyes.Strangely, there were four palm size white cubes which Jacob discovered within everyone's pocket, and by the looks of it, they were a set.But he didn't dare to fiddle with them since he didn't know what these cubes were for and stored them away until he found out.Lastly, there were four Star Watches he got from each person, and all of them seemed quite high quality. At least compared to the one he has!

Chapter 149 Surfing The Star Network
﻿Jacob tried activating the star watch of A-995 but was shocked because there was a red-letter message with a timer and an option in start watch at this moment."User 'Earth Slayer' life signal has vanished!""Please wear the Star Watch and 'Sign In' within 24 hours, or the Star Watch will be reset and any unsaved data will be gone."[Time before the reset: 23:11:39]"New Sign In"Jacob's eyes narrowed and looked at the other three watches, and there was the same kind of message which made Jacob astonished.'This watch might not be as simple as I thought it would, and I think it might not be traceable as I thought it was. These watches are even more advanced than the one I had and need information about killer skull society.'They could tell I killed that orc, and this star network is the only thing that might help me!'Jacob thought before he put on Earth Goblin's black Start Watch!The next moment, a new message appeared on the star watch:"New Life Signal Detected!""Sign In?""(Note: This device is already bonded with 'Earth Slayer' and it will be reset upon New Sign In)"Jacob did not know what a life signal was, but he could tell it wasn't something that a dead person could emit, so he pressed the sign-in. He was more interested in this star watch and star network now.The moment he pressed that option, a ten-second timer appeared which indicated the time it would take to reset it.After the times ended, Jacob saw a colorful screen with a familiar notification.'Welcome to Star Network!''Starting the Bidding process of Star Watch Model-A-11 with the user!''Select the Binding Process'Old User''New User'Jacob didn't see these options in his Model A-05, so he tried selecting the new user since he wanted to create a new account. Then the process was the same as the last one he had to speak for voice recognition.However, the moment he did, another option popped up which made Jacob frown.'Start the DNA Binding?''Yes/Back'Just like the last time, he felt a sharp perk on his wrist, right below the star watch screen.A red scanner appeared at this moment.'DNA has already been registered with the Star Network.''Please Select Old User to continue!'Jacob's frown deepened when he saw the menu return to the first screen again. He reluctantly pressed on Old User then.This time, the Voice Scanner and DNA Scanner were skipped since the data was already collected, and a new option appeared.'Analyzed User Life Signal?''Skip''(Note: With Life Signal, the user account will be 100% secure and without the life signal, the device cannot be used!)'Jacob's eyes narrowed when he read the note. Although he didn't know what this life signal was. But from the looks of it, it had something to do with security, and it was really secure.This security function didn't exist in the old model of A-10000.In the end, Jacob didn't skip it and chose to activate it. He was even more sure now that this thing wasn't hackable, but not 100% sure though.Nevertheless, he no longer dreads this technology anymore because there was no more threat to Jacob's life in the uncommon region.A green scanner appeared, and it remained activated for an entire minute before it vanished.This time, another unfamiliar option appeared:'Transfer Date from Star Watch?''Skip'Jacob thought for a moment before he didn't skip this part as well. He still had a map in that star watch, so he didn't want to discard it just like that.'Please place the star watch banded to you close to Model A-11.'The star watch appeared in Jacob's hand, and the moment it suddenly lit up on its own when it came in the range of model A-11 detection, Jacob saw a transfer screen appearing on both watches before the date transfer was finished within ten seconds.There wasn't much data to transfer, to begin with, so it went quickly.'Profile has been activated!''Bank Account has been activated!''The Star Network is in sync!"'User 'Faceless Ancient' welcome back to Star Network!'After this series of notifications, the menu finally appeared, which had far more options than Jacob's old watch. He even discovered message and camera functions, which made him grimace. Because these two were not present in his old star watch.At that time, he thought they were applications he would get in some app store, but now that he looks carefully, it wasn't the case at all.'That bitch tricked me!' Jacob instantly guessed as he threw an icy glance at A-9999's stewarded body and sneered before looking at the star watch again.This time, Jacob explored every function of the star watch so he won't get tricked by others in the future. It was just like a degraded mobile phone, but Jacob guessed that there might be more advanced star watches that have call functions as well.Nevertheless, just this message function was enough for now, and he could even send an MMS and receive one.However, when Jacob saw the price of just sending a single message without any attachments through the star network, he was astonished. Because it was a whopping 500 gold coins. As for an MMS, it was even more absurd: 10,000 gold coins!'Is this some kind of joke?' Jacob couldn't help but cussed whoever set up this ridiculous price.One had to know that with 10,000 gold coins, someone could buy the entire lion street of lionheart city!In the end, Jacob didn't have anyone to who he wanted to send any message, so he finally opened the last application, which was none other than the star network, which was the main purpose of this thing.A typical browser screen opened in front of Jacob. There was a search option, and other built-in options like, 'Star Information Sea', 'Star Market', 'Private Star Servers', and 'Star Bookmarks'.It intrigued Jacob, as it was just like the internet with slightly distinct features.Curios, he clicked on the star market, and a notification popped up. 'Your Star Watch model can only access the Rare Plains Star Market!'Then a new window appeared in front of him. There were many options like search, materials, weapons, potions, firearms, and so on.Jacob was started when he saw that message and then all those options. He couldn't help but open the firearms.The next moment, a menu appeared, and on the very top of it was a long-barrel automatic rifle with its picture and price of 1 million gold coins and contact info of the seller.There were sniper rifles, bullets, spare parts, and even RPGs.When Jacob's eyes fell on a missile, he couldn't help but exclaimed, "Which lunatic put this Cluster Bomb on sale?!"He couldn't help but look at the price and took a deep breath. It was 100 million gold coins, and the seller was even selling 10 of them!Jacob couldn't help but wonder if these rare planes were like a war zone or with no laws.Despite that, he was still quite elated when he saw all those familiar weapons on sale, which means the rare region was like the modern world and looking forward to going there. He then closed the market since it was useless to look since he couldn't get anything on the common plains even if he bought anything.However, he didn't find any of these scanners or these liquid-type bombs on the market, which means they were not common and might be more precious than he thought.Neither did he find any information regarding magic or any wand like the beanpole of A-995.Then Jacob opened this 'Star Information Sea', which gave him the same notification that the information he could gain was only at the level of the rare plain here, not higher.A panel appeared with only the search engine 'Star Information Sea', nothing else.Jacob then tried typing 'Killer Skull Society. He was most curious about them since he came into contact with it the most, and was his enemy at the moment.When the result came, many files appeared regarding the Killer Skull Society, and these files had different price tags, ranging from 1 gold coin to millions!Jacob frowned when he saw so many files and wasn't sure if this organization was really secretive or not, since so many people have information about them. But most of it might be just random bullshit.There was even an option to create his own information file and then release it in the Star Information Sea like a blog. He even has the option to release it for free or for money as much as he wanted.Jacob instantly felt this site was a scam, but he still kept looking for something which might be useful in this pile of shit.Then Jacob noticed a particular file that was free and posted by a person called, 'The Society Killer'!

Chapter 150 Important Grace34
﻿This file's name was 'Kill Skulls without Consequences', which was quite interesting in Jacob's eyes.He clicked on this file, and since it was free, it got downloaded right away.After he opened it, there were only two pages. On the first page was a strange introduction. It wrote,'If you're interested in killing Skulls for the greater good of the world, please kill with caution and as many as you can!'I'm the biggest hunter of the Killer Skull Society. If you have anything on them, please share. I'll buy it at a very high price as long as you have proof. Contact me at any time as long as it is related to Killer Skull Motherfucking Society!'PS: The Society Killer'As for on the second page, it wrote,'Although I know killing the Skulls is doing good and getting rid of evil, this will also put a target on your head if you killed a high-level skull with a 'Brain Chip' inside his head.'Remembered the motherfucking society always plants a special Brain Chip into the head of their important pawns and any member with C Rank Skull or higher rank officers.'These brain chips are specially designed to remain activated by brain waves and the moment these brain waves vanished, these brain chips will automatically be melted into the brain without leaving a trace.'These brain chips also have another function. They all serve as restraints that will keep the members of society in check, and monitor their brain waves all the time and stop them from revealing any core information to outsiders.'The moment they speak something that is considered forbidden in the brain chip's data module which can alter or update at any time from the main data frame, the brain chip will explode within the brain and kill the traitor in the process.'This process can be done remotely as well.'Nevertheless, it will also send a signal toward their main data frame which will alert the society in 24hr about the member's death. They can even tell if the death was caused by a brain chip's self-destruct or by melting after the brain waves were gone.'Even if someone digs out the brain chip, it would still self-destruct, and they know!'Jacob had a deep frown when he read to this point, 'So, this is the reason why they always know about the death of their members. But who is this person who has such a deep understanding of killer skull society?'Even though he wasn't sure about how much information was true but he was quite convinced that this brain chip might be true.He read the reaming part,'After going through so much trouble and experiment, I could finally find a solution to stop these brain chips' death signals.'Yes! I finally got it, you motherfuckers. If anyone is reading this and a motherfucker skull, then wash your neck because that motherfucking society won't be able to avenge you anymore!'More ironic that you can do nothing about it at all, despite wanting to chop me into a million pieces. If you have guts, then I dare you to remove this file from the star network and come find me, you motherfuckers!'Jacob couldn't help but smile wryly and continue to read.'Ahem, sorry I got emotional just now, and that previous words were not meant for you, my fellow society hunter.'So, note it carefully, the method to stop the brain chip death is to use aluminum foil to seal the head of a skull within half an hour of his death and then buried it at least ten-meter underground, and I can guarantee that the skull society would never know the skull was dead unless they look for him purposely.'If you have a better method please share, the price is negotiable.''PS: The Society Killer'Jacob closed the file and shook his head. 'This is the most primitive method to block an electromagnetic wave.'If this brain chip only emits an electromagnetic wave after someone's death, then I can make an anti-electromagnetic field jammer and destroy the electromagnetic wave entirely,' Jacob thought.Nevertheless, this information was still helpful since it revealed the nature of the brain chips to him.Furthermore, since he no longer has any need to hunt for hearts, he wasn't planning on antagonizing the Killer Skull Society anymore.After injecting this heart essence, he'll leave this place for good and what happened next had nothing to do with him.Afterward, Jacob searched for maps, and he found many detailed maps of Rare Plains, even some specific maps that have safe passages between common and rare plains.In the end, Jacob bought two maps, spending fifty thousand gold coins.He also searched for some more detailed information about rare plains and spent another fifty thousand on many different books, which include beasts of rare plains, terranes, flora and fauna, power hierarchy, and some more important knowledge.Jacob understood that this star network would be more useful than he thought.But he was shocked when he tried searching for 'Zodiac Plains' or 'Zodiac Plains Map' because nothing appeared and he won't be going to believe that no one had ever tried to search for it before.Star Network was like the internet, and it was probably essential to advance civilization like the rare plains, so this information might be far more classified and above the level of the rare plains altogether.In the end, Jacob didn't dwell on this matter since it was out of his scope and check other options of the star networks, but suddenly, a notification popped up, which startled Jacob.'Important Grace34 wanted to add you as a friend!' 'Accept/Cancel'Jacob's eyes narrowed. He had already learned about how the friend function works on the star watch.The profiles serve as a contract and you could search for anyone's profile as long as you have their username on the friend search function. This function wasn't present in the A-10000's watch, so Jacob's profile didn't have an 'Add Friend' option either.However, after he upgraded the star watch this function and the 'Sent Message' function, appeared on Jacob's profile, so now anyone could add him as their contact or send him a message.Furthermore, the friends could send messages and MMS at a 50% discount, which was an unusual aspect.Nevertheless, Jacob knew his contact 'Faceless Ancient' was quite unique, and few people were free enough to search for it as well. So, the only people who would be interested in him and know about this name were the Killer Skull Society!'It's only been less than 2 hours since I killed those four. Could it be their brain chips are high level, and the society already received the reports of their uncanny death and then suspect me?' Jacob mused.Suddenly, another notification popped up before he could decide what to do with this sudden friend request.'Important Grace34 has sent you a message!'Jacob opened it without hesitation, since it was just a message he could see the contents without alerting the other party. As for replying afterward, it solely depended on him.The message was brief;"Important Grace34: If you don't want to be forever hunted by society, then hand over the research data, and we'll consider letting your insolence slide this time."Jacob's lips curled into a wintry smile. 'It seemed they knew, and now whatever this research data is, it is quite important to them.'Their high-level members probably won't make it here in time, and the lower-level members in common plains were only be sending themselves to death if they came after me.'So, they chose a soft approach. But if they think I'm gullible, then they're still underestimating me.'Another message appeared:"Important Grace34: We'll even compensate you with 100 million gold coins and the price is negotiable."Jacob sneered as he typed a message."Faceless Ancient: I don't know what you're talking about and who the fuck are you?"Somewhere far away from common plains,"Bastard, bastard, he's still pretending to be not to know me?! Do you think I'm a fool?!" An enraged holler filled with hatred and frustration rang in the room.The sound of teeth grinding together could be heard as a masked person stood with a hologram display above his covered wrist. There was a message box that had a chat open with 'Faceless Ancient'.This mysterious person was Important Grace34.A few minutes ago, Important Grace34 received the grave news that all the A-rank skulls sent to oversee the cannibal plan were dead, and he nearly vomited blood in anger.Because it was too sudden, this had thrown their entire plan into shamble, and whoever killed those members was clearly much stronger than them. So, sending lower-level skulls after him would be a waste.As for who killed them all, he naturally thought of the only person who could have done so, but it was nearly impossible.Nevertheless, he tried to search for the person on the star network, since it was the only clue they had.But when he saw a message option appearing on Faceless Ancient's profile, which clearly wasn't there before, Important Grace34 instantly knew it was definitely this bastard who did it!
