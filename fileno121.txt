Chapter 121 Rare Tier?
﻿Jacob was refining the last batch of the titan tears.With this, he would have 1,754 titan tears drops in total.After the smock vanished, Jacob took out a large glass jar, which was almost filled with dark liquid and he put those few drops into the jar and stowed it away in his pendant again.He then looked at the reaming pile of the titan iron and shook his head in pity. 'All of this will be going to waste. Well, I'll let that trolls have it. If he survived the extraction of the parasite gem.' He thought.However, at this moment, his eyes narrowed when he heard faint steps and calm heartbeats. His hearing now was extremely sensitive. He could listen to a sound within a hundred meters radius, and the closer the sound was, the stronger his hearing.He could tell these heartbeats weren't from his slaves nor any of the members of the sunset family, but these heartbeats were extremely calm as they moved toward his location.'Did I get exposed?' Jacob's eyes turned sharper. 'If there's someone with a brain, it wasn't hard to figure it out. They just have to investigate the people who know about convoy routes and then take out the suspects one by one.'I don't know if slave no.1 (Sunset Duke) is still alive or not since these parasite gem controllers will remain the same even if the slave died or the gem shattered. If that's the case, then I would suffer an enormous loss if I lost that rare-grade parasite gem.'Jacob frowned before he looked at the staircase with cold eyes. He wanted to see if this was just a coincidence or if these two strangers were really here for him and know about this place.He wasn't afraid of anyone in the uncommon region or even rarer region, so he didn't mind seeing how things were playing out. Furthermore, he was about to leave anyway, so he didn't mind creating some trouble for trolls.Thereupon, when the steps were finally at the door of the underground warehouse.'Boom…'The door was blasted into bits!Jacob's lips curled slightly, 'So, they knew. What a drag….'Footsteps rang as the intruders were slowly descending the staircase as if they weren't in the least bit worried about whoever was hiding in this place.Jacob was the same. He remained static while looking at the staircase.The warehouse was illuminated with lamps, so it wasn't difficult to see each other.Two capped persons appeared in Jacob's view at this moment, while the same could be said to be for the other two.Both sides looked at each other.Jacob suddenly frowned before his calm expression suddenly crumbled when he felt a strange sensation from one of the capped figures, which made his fine hair stand!'I'm feeling danger?!' Jacob was flabbergasted as his expression turned grave.He knew better than anyone that if someone could make him feel danger right now, that person had to be at least an Epic or even stronger.Furthermore, there was a helper as well. He couldn't help but cussed his bad luck.'Just what the hell are these guys doing here?!'Jacob was no longer confident in killing them. Even his escape route was blocked by those two right now."Cursed Immortality!"Jacob quickly summoned the book. He wanted to know what tier they were and if he could bluff his way out of this mess.While Jacob felt the hidden danger, he remained static without showing anything, while the other party was the same as well.'Why is there someone like this doing in this place?! Could it be the organization plan has leaked between the upper echelons of one of the three hegemonies?'It might be this person deliberately killed the Rogue Skull so he could lure us here and then get rid of all of us in a fell swoop?! Or this is just one terrible coincidence… no…' The woman's mind was also working like lightning as my speculation appeared.She never thought the 'fish' she wanted to eat turned out to be just the tip of the tail of a shark!If she knew, she could've at least brought her weapon with her and her fighting gear. But she appeared unarmed since she also didn't think there would be someone who could threaten her life in this kind of place.While she sensed the danger from Jacob, her partner didn't have their strength level and developed that danger instinct.He coldly sneered, "So, you were the one who killed Rogue Skull and stole something that belonged to the organization. You lowly thrall, you really have guts."The woman trembled when she heard this, 'This muscle brain would be the death of both of us! If I knew, I would've eaten him long ago!'Jacob, on the other hand, had an extremely sharp hearing, 'Why is the other one's heart rate increased so much while this guy is as calm as ever? Could it be the other guy can also sense that sensation as well and is now wary of me while this one can't?'He quickly reached this conclusion since he was also surprised by the enemy's strength, so this might have been the case for the enemy as well.But it still didn't mean it was enough to make the enemy back off. There are still two of them while he was alone.'Wait a minute… if they also think like me, then they're unprepared like me as well!' Jacob's eyes shone with a thoughtful light.The Immortika finally replied about the information he asked for as well."Hahahahaha… this is really a godsend. Would could've thought you would encounter a rare species so soon! Hahahaha…""The fuck you're talking about?! That guy is nowhere near a rare species! Now give me the information I need without messing around!" Jacob tutted the moment he saw those words."Bastard, you dare to ignore…""Shut Up!"Before the other guy could complete his sentence, the woman bellowed at him furiously, which startled him greatly. He could feel the extremely icy feeling from her, and he shuddered. He didn't dare to utter another word anymore.'I was right!' Jacob quickly caught the strangeness between their wording, and this was just enough to make him even more assured about this previous speculation.While Immortika also finished writing,"You idiot, I said 'Rare Species' not 'Tier' which means literally what it means."Didn't I already tell you that 'Common, Rare, Rarer…' bullshit was just these natives have created themselves so they could feel better and hide their inferiority from others?"Let me tell you, the Tier-1 to Tier-12 Ranks were actually called the Common-Tier Ranks. I can't tell you that at the time because you hadn't contacted a higher-tier being."But now that you did, I can tell you that the Common-Tier Ranks are the bottom feeders of the evolution chain and are as irrelevant as ants."Above 12 Common-Tier are the 9 Rare-Tiers, and any Rare-Tier-1 Creature can stomp a thousand Common-Tier-12s like ants."From two creatures in front of you, one is a Common Tier-12 Lion-Head Orc, while the other is a Rare Tier-1 Dark Elf. You're also at the Rare Tier-1."Oh, and a Dark Elf can use initial-level element power as well. Which in your term means… magic! Hahahahah…"When Jacob read all the information at a lightning speed, he nearly lost his footing when he saw the word 'Magic' which was the last thing he was expecting to come in contact with in this place.Magic was a fabled concept to him even now, and he had no idea just how deadly Magic was or how it worked. He was simply clueless about it. Although he felt much better when Immortika told him he was also a level of the rare-tier-1, that means he could put up a fight.But the word 'Magic' made his heart waver a little and completely toss the idea of even trying to kill the other party.'You could've kept the last part to yourself, right? But you deliberately reveal it to me to make things worse!' Jacob tutted coldly.He clearly knew just how sinister this book's mentality was, and it wanted nothing but to watch Jacob burn the world down while enjoying itself from the sidelines."May I know why are you in the Common Plains?" The woman suddenly spoke politely, without any hint of emotion.Jacob had yet to utter even a word as he was just staring at them without any expressions.'Common Plains?' Jacob's eyes shimmered with uncertainty.But now that he knew what kind of existence the other party was, he didn't want to appear ignorant, or he might lose the element of mystery.He coldly said, "Oh, you want to know? Then how about you told me what a Lion-Head Orc and a Dark Elf are doing in this place?"'How did he know?!'They both thought at the same time. Since they were wearing masks that could easily hide their racial features beneath their capes, someone couldn't know their exact race.But this mysterious man knew!

Chapter 122 Birth Of Facelss Ancient
﻿The Orc was instantly on high alert and finally understood why his companion shut him down.'This is terrible! If he's as strong as this crazy bitch, we'll be at a disadvantage since we didn't bring our battle gears and weapons. Fuck my luck!' He cussed inwardly, 'Should I make an escape? I will only get in her way, but she might kill me if she takes it the wrong way, and the organization won't hold her accountable as well!'The Dark Elf, on the other hand, was much more composed than the panicking Orc.Although she was also apprehensive of this mysterious man now, she couldn't escape as long as her life wasn't threatened. Furthermore, with the start of the Cannibal Plan, she couldn't retreat now.She even regretted starting the war so soon without investigating this variable thoroughly.She was at fault this time, and she might suffer a terrible backlash from the organization for this. If she escaped without even trying, she would be dealt with no matter how good reason she had!"It's indeed impolite to not introduce ourselves." She finally spoke, "I'm Skull NO. A-9999, this is my boorish companion, Skull NO. A-10000. I apologize for his unsophisticated speech and for barging in like this. We'll compensate for this if you don't mind."'It's these guys again!' Jacob tutted inwardly when he heard the introduction.But he was as shocked as he was vexed by the Killer Skull Society's prowess and their members. He finally understood why that guy told him that strength doesn't matter in this organization and that the lower the number of members, the stronger they were.'There are even 9998 below her, and she's already at my level. It seemed I can't mess with the Killer Skull Society openly.' He grimaced.But he didn't lose his composure. He could feel their heart rates were hurried, especially the Orc.It also proved that they didn't know about his strength and came unprepared, and they wanted to avoid a conflict that was aligned with his thoughts.But he had an upper hand when it comes to the element of mystery, so he doesn't want to appear too obvious.He coldly sneered, "The Clown Society really knows how to act arrogantly when the odds are in their favor while also knowing when to retreat when kicked in an iron plate."Skull NO. A-10000 clenched his fists when he heard ridicule in Jacob's tone and called their organization 'Clown Society' without any fear.The Dark Elf was also displeased with this remark, but she knew they were at fault, and from Jacob's confident tone, he wasn't afraid of them as well. She didn't want to fight when she wasn't even had her weapon, so she endured the urge to curse back."We didn't know about Sir's presence in this place, or we would come bearing gifts. It was just a terrible misunderstanding. But I think Sir just went a little excessive with your words."You took something from our agent, but we don't want any conflicts. So, we would like to buy it back, at the right price. What do you think? I hope you would consider the goodwill of the Killer Skull Society." Skull NO. A-9999 calmly offered.Since Jacob hadn't attacked, this also put her mind at ease, and now she just has to negotiate with him. Once she acquired the titan tears. She will alert society about Jacob's presence here and let them decide what to do next. She just wanted to complete this task and get out of there now.Jacob squinted his eyes. 'Are they talking about the mutant? No, that thing isn't worth sending someone like Skull NO. A-9999 here.' His eyes suddenly shimmered with surprise as he glanced at titan iron, 'Could it be…?'"I pick many things from here and there, so be specific about what you want?" Jacob coolly stated.Skull NO. A-9999 replied without any hesitation, "You might have come in contact with a Rogue Skull of our society. He was a traitor and took a precious potion formula and ran away with it many years ago."It seemed he had offended you, and we're glad you took him out. But that formula belongs to society, and we would very much like to buy it back from you. It is called the Titan Tears, and society knows you have it."She deliberately highlighted society's name to make Jacob apprehensive, while society didn't know at all!'So, the secret organization after that idiot was the clown society? I might've thought.' Jacob smiled wryly. 'I have two copies of titan tears. One is translated and only has two formulas, while the original one is still not completely translated.'Even Tunny wasn't able to decipher more than six pages despite knowing the Philosopher's language. He said that there were levels of Philosopher's language available to different ranks.'There should be six levels of Philosopher's Language, and Tunny only mastered the first one, and he was required to be a Master Potion Alchemist to get the information for level 2.'Jacob mused, in these six months he learned the Philosopher's language, but he found out that it wasn't complete, and Tunny told him the truth about it.Furthermore, the titan tears formula was quite complex, so Tunny could only decipher the first six pages accurately which recorded the formula of uncommon titan tears and rare titan tears.But when Jacob tried to read it, he found that the first page was filled with unfamiliar words, and only some of them were familiar. Which made him speculate that the introduction part wasn't clearly translated and Tunny might've made mistakes.Nevertheless, just the two formulas were enough for Tunny and Jerry to reach the peak of common rank. So, they didn't care. While Jacob was different, he was planning on completely deciphering the book.The Titan Tears were very useful to him, and he didn't want to search for a substitute. He was afraid he might not even find a substitute as good as titan tears. So, he was planning to research the Philosopher's language when the time came.However, he never thought the Killer Skull Society knew about this formula as well and after it, and even tracked him down.'Tunny told me Jerry found this book in ruin, and he never let anyone see it all these years. So, they might only know the name but not the contents of the book…' Jacob thought sharply.He decided to test it, and said, "If that's the case, I don't mind giving it back since there are only two potions formulas which would be quite useless to me after some time. Your society doesn't mind me using it, right?" Skull NO. A-9999 had a silent sigh of relief when she heard this. If Jacob didn't agree, then she might really have to test his strength. But now that he spoke like this, it means he was willing to give it back at the expense of continue using it for himself until he deemed it useless.It also means he was 'afraid' of society.Completely at ease, she chuckled and said, "We're not that mulish. Since you do us a favor by getting rid of a traitor, we won't inflict any rules. But please keep this formula to yourself for 20 years and afterward you can release it publicly if you want. You can do that, right?"Jacob pulled a snide smile and nodded, "Of course, since you guys cooperating, I can't reject your goodwill, right?"Inwardly, Jacob sneered, 'Heh, I'm profiting big time!'Now that his mind was at complete ease, he said, "Let's discuss the price. What is your offer?"Jacob knew the Killer Skull Society's roots runs deep, and money might be just a number for them. So, he wanted something that only someone in their position could offer, but he had no idea what to ask for. He felt exasperated when he thought about his shallow knowledge.That's why he let them decide first, and see what they're willing to offer.Skull NO. A-9999 had no idea about Jacob's ignorance, so she only thought it was Jacob's way to see their goodwill.She pondered a bit before she said, "First, can you tell me what were you doing here and your name?"She asked this because of the Cannibal Plan, and if Jacob wasn't here to mess with them and only here for the titan iron, then there was no need to turn hostile to him.But if he was investigating them, then it means the three hegemonies knew about their plan, which changed their entire plan.Jacob squinted his eyes and suddenly asked, "The war was startled by you guys, right?"Skull NO. A-9999 thought for a moment and nodded, "Yes, are you intending to stop it?' She probed.Jacob chuckled and shook his head, "I have nothing to do with anyone in the uncommon region. Don't worry. I won't get in your way as long as you stay out of mine."I was only here for titan iron, as you had already guessed."As for my name, call me… Faceless Ancient!"

Chapter 123 Star Watch
﻿When Jacob was about to give his alias, 'Jack'. His eyes suddenly landed on Immortika's newly written words."Call yourself Faceless Ancient. You'll thank me later!"Although he didn't know why he went with Immortika's suggestion at that moment."… As for my name, call me… Faceless Ancient!""Why did you want me to use this name?" Jacob then asked with uncertainty.Although he didn't mind using this alias. But it came from Immortika. He was curious about it, as well as slightly wary."I can't answer that… hahahaha."Jacob's expression darkened, and he directly closed the book in exasperation. He knew Immortika's antics very well. Even though it liked to mess around, it never lied to Jacob, and its words always have some kind of mystery behind them."What an arrogant way to call yourself!" Skull NO. A-10000 finally couldn't help but sneer.He has been suppressing his emotions and was on high alert for quite a while now, and since Jacob turned out to be non-hostile, he finally opened his mouth."Can you keep your mouth close for a moment? Or would you like your tongue to rip out?" Skull No. A-9999 coldly berated in a threatening tone.Although Jacob appeared to be unhostile at the moment, he might turn hostile if he felt offended because Skull No. A-9999 would!She would want to rip apart an idiot Orc if he dared to talk with her in this tone.Jacob coldly looked at the Lion-Headed Orc and spoke, "I want his life as a part of this deal now."Skull No. A-10000's eyes contracted when he heard this, and he took a step back. He suddenly felt a murderous pressure on him when Jacob looked at him. He even felt Skull No. A-9999 would take this chance to get rid of him, and he was ready to flee.Skull No. A-9999, however, shook her head. "I know he's annoying and disrespectful, but this isn't called for a death sentence. Besides, we'll deal with our own people. I'll raise your compensation for this offense."Jacob was startled. He didn't expect this decisive woman would take this stance. He was simply testing the waters to see just how united they were, but he never thought she would risk turning adverse for that idiot.'Either she's extremely loyal to the society or she's bonded by something like a parasite gem that won't allow her to take certain actions.' Jacob mused with a sharp light in his eyes, 'Killer Skull Society, huh? I'll see more of them in the future.'"Alright, let's hear it." Jacob nodded without forcing Skull No. A-9999.Skull No. A-10000 had a massive sigh of relief when he saw the situation was subdued, and he didn't dare to open his mouth again. The opponent wasn't someone who he could mess with or poke remarks at. Skull No. A-9999 also felt this person was quite sensitive like her and this kind of opponent she hated the most. Because they were too hard to deal with.She spoke in her charming voice, "500 Million Gold Coins for your inconvenience and a Rare Tier-1 Technology of Light Orb Shield for the titan tears as goodwill from our organization. Furthermore, if you're willing to leave the Common Plains, I'll add a Common Tier-12 Haste Potion Formula!"Although Skull No. A-9999 didn't have the authority to make this offer.But she knew when the higher-ups of the society heard that someone like Jacob was lurking under their noses and this endangered their entire plan, they will pay even more to make Jacob leave the three kingdoms!Jacob's eyes dilated when he heard this unusual offer. 'Could this be the normal means of trading between the rare kind? A Rare Tier Technology seems quite nice, and I've heard of this haste potion. It can raise someone's speed by 5% percent in those books, and this potion is quite rare.'But she's willing to give me the entire formula just to make me leave this 'Common Plains'. It's quite generous. Well, it's a good deal for me.'If she had told me to wait here so she could fetch those things, I would rather leave than wait for her to bring her weapons or some helpers. But how is she going to give me all this? She didn't even carry a bag?'He suppressed his curiosity, nodded, and said subtly, "Alright, I won't appear unjust. But I want the complete map. Mine was destroyed. That's why I wandered here in this shithole. I also wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible."Jacob ambiguously demands a map as to what kind of map he'll let them decide for themselves. But he was sure that after observing the scale of his power, they would definitely give him a map suitable for someone like him.Furthermore, he never planned on staying here. He would put a target on himself since society would see him as a threat. He also didn't know if they have more people like the dark elf, so he won't give them time to call for reinforcement.So, he would leave the moment this deal was finalized!He was now truly scared for his life and was determined to remain low-key unless it was necessary.Jacob also knew as long as he held the titan tears formula, they won't make a move on him, but the moment the formula left his hands, they will try to hunt him down.After all, in their eyes, Jacob now knew whatever they were doing, and they won't let him spread the news for the secrecy's sake.They were only friends and back down for a moment!Skull No.9999 eyes shone in understanding when she heard this, 'So, he appeared here by chance? Well, it does make sense since it would be far more dangerous to cross to this side without a clear route.'She mused. She even felt relief. It also gave her some hints about Jacob's background.Furthermore, Jacob didn't seem to be aware of their Cannibal Plain, or he won't make a deal like this by handing over the Titan Tears Formula.Nevertheless, she knew the moment Jacob left this place he will be hunted down before he could cross to the other side.Killer Skull Society won't let a variable like Jacob leave this place under any circumstances when it comes to the Cannibal Plan.However, Skull No.9999 would be completely out of this situation since it won't be her problem anymore. She didn't want to fight with Jacob under these circumstances either. Since this might alert that hidden 'Protector of the Zodiac Taurus Bank'.So, letting Jacob leave the three kingdoms' territory first and then letting the society hunt him down would be a far better option."Alright, give me your account number. I'll transfer the gold coins, technology, potion formula, and map right away into your Star Watch. But I need access to my Star Watch for this. Can I?" Skull No.9999 showed a silver wristband on her ebony wrist.Jacob squinted his eyes when he saw the wristband. 'Now, what is this Star Watch? Is this an advanced mobile technology?'Now, he was really in a dilemma. He didn't know there was something like this and that these methods of exchange would be entirely virtual. This place was just far behind in technology from the place these two were.But he can't tell them he only has a pager, which didn't even have any signal here.So, he made an ambiguous excuse, "Do I look like I'm wearing one?" He coolly showed his wrists.Skull No.9999 eyes squinted behind the cape when she heard it, 'It seemed he was telling the truth.'Nonetheless, she then looked at Skull No.10000 and said, "Give him yours."Skull No.10000 was baffled by this command, 'Fuck, I spent 50 million to buy this watch, and now she wanted to give it away?!'But he still reluctantly took off the black wristband from his wrist. He said, "Unbound, Reset" after pressing a button on the side.The next moment, a screen lit up on the wristband before he tossed it toward Jacob with a resentful grunt.Jacob caught the four inches wide wristband. It was extremely smooth and slick; it was like a rubber band.If he hadn't seen the screen with his eyes and a slim button on the side, he would think it was just an ordinary rubber band."This is my account number ***."To distract Skull No.9999, he gave his account number.He didn't think she would give him this Star Watch, and now he didn't know how to activate it.But he still wore it as if he knew precisely what he was doing and pressed the button like the Skull No.10000.Skull No.9999 nodded and suspected nothing and thought Jacob was just activating the Star Watch, so she also started pressing on the silver wristband on her wrist, which differed greatly from the one on Jacob's wrist.Jacob saw a screen appear on his Star Watch, which made his eyes contract."Welcome to Star Network!"

Chapter 124 Star Network
﻿'Welcome to Star Network!'Jacob's cocked an eyebrow when he saw the color screen and familiar white color words. The words change into another after the introduction.'Starting the Bidding process of Star Watch Model-A05 with the user!''Please speak 'Continue' for voice recognition.'Jacob coldly does as it was written, "Continue."A blue scanner suddenly lit on the screen before new words appeared.'Voice Recognition has been successful.''Start the DNA Binding?''Yes/No'Jacob's eyes narrowed as he touched the 'Yes'.He was monitoring Skull No.9999 as he saw her also tapping on the lit screen.The next moment thereafter, he felt a sharp perk on his wrist, right below the star watch screen.'This thing can pierce through my skin? And where did that pin was hidden?'Jacob was astonished when he felt the pin perking on his skin and then vanishing just like that. He looked at the Star Watch profoundly.Another red scanner appeared at this moment.'DNA has been collected to Star Network.''New user detected.''Please Select a Star Network Username.'A small keyboard appeared with an empty name box.Jacob thought for a moment and then looked at the other two, he typed,'Faceless Ancient'If not that he had already given this name to them, he hadn't chosen it. He didn't know if they would be able to see his name or not. Just to be safe, he decided to change it after his deal was done with those two.However, he nearly cursed when he saw the next words,'The Username is available.''The username has been selected and unchangeable for 20 years.''Select Privacy:'Public'Private'Jacob chose private without even looking at the details below.'Collecting data on user…'Profile:'Name: Jacob Steve'Race: Human'Sex: Male'Affiliation(s):'Zodiac Taurus Bank: Common C-Rank Mercenary''Alchemy Guild: Basic GunsmithJacob's eyes went wide as saw his information appearing one after another. This information was all that was recorded in the uncommon branches of these two organizations.However, this wasn't the end, the scanning was still active, and the screen changed again,'A D-Tier Zodiac Personal Account has been detected!'Do you want to connect the Bank Account with Star Watch Model-A05?''Just what the fuck is this Star Network, it got everything just by a DNA scan. It is probably even more advanced than the internet.' Jacob was vigilant as he tapped on 'Yes' again.Although this Star Watch has access to his data, it revealed nothing about his special circumstances. So, he wasn't a concern anymore.'The Account *** has been connected with the Star Watch Model-A05!'After that, the menu was finally open, and there were only five icons with their names.'Profile''Bank''Files''Date Transfer''Start Network'However, before he could explore any further, a notification appeared as his 'Bank' icon flashed. 'Picky Eater transfer 500 Million Gold Coins into your account…'Jacob looked at Skull No.9999 as she was now looking at him as well."Do you receive it?" She asked.'Picky Eater, really?' Jacob looked at her strangely, but he nodded his head, "Picky Eater, I presumed?"Jacob clicked on the bank icon, and he saw his bank balance had increased by five hundred million."Current Balance: 723,890,130"Another notification appeared on the screen.'Your D-Tier Account is eligible for C-Tier Upgrade.'Upgrade/Later'Jacob upgrades it without any hesitation. 'This thing is far more convent than that ZMTD.'Skull No.9999 looked at Jacob's profile sneakily as well,'Faceless Ancient: Private Account'She coldly grunted when she saw this and closed it."Alright. I need to look at the formula of titan tears first before I'll transfer the date." Skull No.9999 coldly told.In this short time, she had already alerted the higher-ups of Jacob's presence, and when she told them he was willing to hand over the Titan Tears Formula and willing to leave this place. They instantly agreed with the compensation.Not only that, but they sent her a new map so she could give it to Jacob.She knew the society has already on the move and Jacob would be dealt with as long as he followed this exact map.Furthermore, she wasn't worried that Jacob would not follow the map because as long as Jacob stayed in Common Plains, he won't be able to hide from society's eye!She even used the 'picture function', which was unique to her Star Watch, which was of a higher model. She took Jacob's pictures without even him knowing and sent them back.'You could only blame yourself for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.' A cold glint flashed past her eyes. She almost believed that Jacob was likely telling the 'truth' about how he appeared here.But for the greater good of their cause, they can't let Jacob leave the common plains!Even if he had that Star Watch, he could only make bank transitions, use Star Network's search engine, or buy some virtual staff. He can't contact anyone with that old model or send messages.She thought Jacob wasn't aware of such a function after she saw he wasn't demanding her star watch.Even A-99999 got that model after spending a fortune in the society member shop.Jacob thought it made sense, so he took out a book from his 'pocket'.Although Tunny only translated two formulas, they still filled this hundred-page book.Jacob opened the book in his hand and let Skull No.9999 have a look at the contents. He knew she can easily see every word from this distance.After the thirtieth page, he closed the book and coldly said, "You have already seen the first formula. After the transaction is complete, this book is yours."Skull No.9999 nodded. She had some understanding of potions, so when she saw diagrams and complex algorithms of materials and their components, she knew it was indeed the real deal.She tapped the transfer files app on her watch and placed two files in the transfer tray.Jacob felt the vibration from his star watch. He saw the notification of the transfer and accepted it.The next moment, within two seconds, three files appear.Two were complex, while the last one was a virtual map that was extremely large, and his lips curled up when he saw the details.'What a fucking big world…' He thought with exasperation.This map covered the entire Common Plains, which was divided into Epic, Rarer, Rare, Uncommon, and Common Regions by the natives.But actually, it was just the most insignificant region, and its area wasn't even a tenth of the Rare Plains, which was the place from where the Dark Elf came!That's why Jacob was shocked by the vastness of this world, and he was longer even thought about how huge this world was and finally understood why it was called the Zodiac Plains, not Zodiac World.He closed the virtual map and decided to study it after no one was around.He then tossed the book toward Skull No.9999, and she caught it.She quickly opened the other half part, and after confirming it was all there, she put the book away.She was finally relaxed, and now even if Jacob turned hostile she could easily escape."It's nice doing business with you." She asked in a friendly tone. Now, her entire tone was changed."Likewise." Jacob nodded without any emotions.She then posed another question in a gentle tone, "So, when will you leave?"Jacob coldly replied, "In one day, I still have this titan iron to refine. I can't waste it, right? So, please, if you will.""Tsk, tsk, alright, I was just being friendly. Let's go, there is no place for warmth in this world." She lamented, but her steps were swift.'This two-face bitch, she's leaving me behind!' Skull No.10000 cursed as he fled at full speed. He didn't dare to stay with Jacob alone!'Dark Elf of Elf Race, huh? There are thousands of folktales about them in my old world. I never thought I would encounter one in such a situation. Well, she was a Dark Elf, so I still didn't encounter a real elf yet.' Jacob couldn't help but think like this since now he wasn't under pressure.When he was in peril, he didn't care about anything except his life, even if he met a fabled dragon. He would not let his thought wander in such a situation.However, now that he was out of danger, he was curious.Nevertheless, this didn't mean it was completely out of danger since Skull No.9999 left.He knew she might've already contacted them through her Star Watch. It was completely possible, so he wasn't planning on staying here for a second longer.Jacob told them he was going to leave in a day to buy himself some time. In fact, he was going to leave right now.Jacob had nothing to carry. He even abandoned his precious distillation equipment.In the deep shade of night, Jacob left like a phantom just like he appeared!

Chapter 125 A Mind Game
﻿Inside a large hall, a few cloaked figures were sitting around a round table while facing a cloaked figure's projection."Do any of you find this Faceless Ancient background?" A grim voice sounded from the projection.One of the cloak figures replied sulkily, "No, there's no record in Rare Plains about such a figure. He must be a nobody who was probably being chased by someone and accidentally crossed to the Common Plains, as A-9999 reported."Another cloaked spoke at this moment. "I found something interesting, though.""Oh, let's hear it." The person in the projection coolly shifted his focus on this small figure, as well as everyone else."From this Faceless Ancient fellow's Star Network Account, I found that he had never made a purchase and wasn't in any of the three hegemonies' private star servers."Although no one can bypass Star Network's security, this doesn't mean everyone is anonymous. However, this person is quite peculiar since it's out of the ordinary to not buy or have any contact with the Star Network, despite being a Rare Rank expert.""So, according to you, this person isn't from the Rare Region, but the Common Region, and he somehow threatened and fooled A-9999 into handing over everything he required to cross to this side?" The person in the projection voice was filled with unspeakable danger.If this was true, then didn't this mean they were just fooled by a native of a common region?It would turn their Killer Skull Society's prestigious into the mud."It's just my speculation. Although there's hardly any case of someone breaking into Rare Rank from Common Rank in the Common Plains, there's still a possibility, and we can't ignore it even if we didn't want to." The person sighed and continued, "If we look at the bright side, if he really is a native of common plains and somehow achieved this level of power that could threaten A-9999, then there's only one possibility.""What might that be?""Titan Tears!" He said matter-of-factly.The entire room fell into silence after they heard it.After a few moments, the person in projection impassively said, "It seemed you found something which made you quite sure that this is the native of common plains, right?""It's indeed true." The person nodded. "After I analyzed the Titan Tear's two formulas acquired by A-9999, I found they were written in a first-level Philosopher's Language."We never paid much attention to this formula unearthed in the common plains and let it rested in the hand of Rogue Skull for years as a keepsake."However, after this Faceless Ancient crawl out of nowhere, it made me think, what if Titan Tears weren't just a Common Rank Formula, but a Rare Rank which would make it easier for common species to break into rare species?"I have already tested the Basic Common Grade formula, and trust me, with only 1000 drops a normal lab rat turned into Tier-3 Common Species, and there's still an Intermediate version that required titan iron essence to make, and we'll have the result soon!""What?!""Is that true?"Everyone exclaimed when they heard this.Even the person in the projection trembled ever so slightly."Silence!" He coldly uttered, making everyone shut their mouth.He then deeply spoke, "Sent me the data."pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "I have already mailed you." The man chuckled as if he had already expected this.The person in the projection went silent, and no one speak anymore. They knew he was seeing the test results and they wait eagerly for his reply.After a few minutes, the figure in the projection finally spoke with a hint of elation. "This is indeed a magical potion. Your theory about that native might be true indeed. The Rogue Skull was simply incompetent. That's why we never found the true value of titan tears."Now, I understand, you're suspecting that this native didn't hand over the whole formula because it might be written in a higher-level Philosopher's language and given us a copy, right?" He sharply questioned."Only one way to find out." the person said darkly, "But if it's true, then we can't let him escape with such a potion in his possession. Even the three hegemonies would do anything to get their hand on Titan Tears if it can increase someone's chances of crossing the rare rank!""Indeed, he must think we won't be able to find out about it just because he handed over a part of it. His thinking process is indeed like a typical plains native who didn't know the vastness of this world."But he would know soon since he had Star Watch now, and this would make him desperate to hide. Yet, it's to our advantage."The person in projection coldly declared, "Order A-9999 to chase after him and keep track of his whereabouts. She didn't need to engage until the reinforcements arrived."Even if this is all just a speculation, we can't ignore it and have to get rid of him. Sent one Three-Digit skull as well as two peak four-digit skulls. This Faceless Ancient has to die for his disparaged view of us!"---A silhouette was moving between trees in the middle of the night at high speed.This person was none other than Jacob, who was already at the border of the Humane Kingdom after he left the Sunset Duke Estate an hour ago.He was in a hurry to enter the Humane. He stowed away his Star Watch since he didn't know if it was traceable or not.If not for that virtual map on the watch, he might've destroyed it.So, he decided to only activate it when he wanted to leave the Common Plains, right now, he didn't have such a plan because he would be at the bottom of the food chain in Rare Plains, and he wasn't confident in crossing the boundary with no harm.Furthermore, since he was now invincible in common plains and only existences of the Dark Elf level could threaten him, he was going to hunt any species that could increase his prowess.One had to know, Jacob was only 50% done with his heart conversion, and he was already at the level of a Tier-1 Rare being like a Dark Elf.The Common Plains were now like his hunting ground, where he could increase his prowess to an even higher level taking no risks.But he knew the Killer Skull Society will be going to hunt him, and this will make his life somewhat difficult.However, as long as he increased his heart percentage as well as learned how to control fluid acceleration, even Skull-9999 would not be his match.That's why he wanted to use his speed to increase the gap before changing his appearance and lying low in the humane kingdom.No one knew he was actually a human, and no one would have believed it either. So, he was going to mix with humans, and in the meantime, learn fluid acceleration.The Killer Skull Society was doing something in the humane kingdom, and this would be the perfect time to act as a human and hide somewhere near a random town.If someone like Skull-10000 came scouting the area, he would gladly welcome them with his swords!Now, this was a mind game, and Jacob was quite good at playing them!Jacob easily passed through the army barricade and headed toward the Rainy Mountain Ranges. He was going to choose a spot that was close to the Rainy Mountain Ranges so he could flee anytime.The Lionheart City was naturally the place that came to his mind, and that place was quite far away from the war as well.Some people even know him as a C-Rank Mercenary so it would be a perfect mirage.---Skull A-9999 naturally received the order to tail Jacob and didn't let him out of her sight. They even offer her enticing rewards to keep her motivated.'Hmph! They are just afraid they will lose him, and I'm better at tracking.' A-9999's eyes turn cold, 'But I really suffer a loss in that fellow's hands this time. I can monitor him, and when the reinforcements arrive, I'll see how he can remain composed and arrogant at that time!'She easily held a grudge, and if she wasn't completely confident in killing Jacob, she won't make a move.Now that the orders were only to follow Jacob, she didn't mind, since it was her specialty to track others.She left the Cannibal Plan to A-10000, who was now much reserved, and left toward the sunset mansion. This time she brings her gear and weapon.'It's only been an hour, so he was still making the titan tears. Hehe, let's see where you can hide!'She chose a spot a hundred meters away from the underground facility where Jacob was brewing titan tears, and she hid within a tree crown.When half the day passed, she felt something amiss. 'Is he an idiot or just too confident? He still dared to make titan tears despite knowing that we are on to him!'

Chapter 126 Returning To Lionheart City
﻿The Lionheart City was still the same as ever, lively.But the situation because of the raging war between the Humane Kingdom and the Earthen Kingdom had made it even livelier.The reason being it was far from the frontline and closest to the vast Rainy Mountain Ranges.Since trolls stopped the cowardly human route toward the common region, the only way left for them was the Rainy Mountain Ranges. The Humane Kingdom was like a wall between the Rainy Mountain Ranges and the two kingdoms.For decades, the Humane Kingdom had been blocking the stampedes of animals led by beasts for these two kingdoms like a sentry.Some humans even believed that these two kingdoms left them here for this exact reason, and it was nothing but a curse.However, now it had become a blessing because the trolls couldn't block their retreat route toward the Rainy Mountain Ranges even if they wanted to.Even though the Rainy Mountain Ranges were extremely dangerous for common folks, it was still better than being slaughtered by the Trolls.However, unlike the common region, humans weren't hastily to retreat into the Rainy Mountain Ranges, especially those nobles.They were waiting for the news on the front line and hoping that the royals could negotiate with the trolls and stop this unjust war. So, they don't have to leave their homes and wealth.That's why the barren and weakest Gloria Country became almost congested.Those who couldn't enter any city or town made camps around them, and most of these people were the actual residents of Gloria Country, who were forced out of their hoses by powerful mercenaries or noblemen.Even the ruling family of the Gloria Country, the Gloria Family was rumored to force out of their castle and live in a shed of their own territory because a Marquise Rank figure occupied their castle with his family and other high-ranking nobles.In the middle of the night,A silhouetted wearing a hood appeared on the Lionheart City's wall as his amber eyes were icy cold as he looked at the brightly lit town even in the middle of the night.This person was none other than Jacob, who just reached here.Because the main gates were closed, he had no choice but to climb the wall, which was a piece of cake for him.There were many camps outside, and some tatter camps with people living in famine. He could understand why they were in such shape. He had seen trolls in already conquered human cities, butchering humans, raping women, and abusing children.However, he didn't lend a helping hand since it would only make him expose himself, nor he would even if the Killer Skull Society wasn't on to him.War is part of every nation's history and without the capability of war, a nation can never be called strong.Even those piece-loving nations are required to have the power to keep the peace, much less a war-mongrel nation like Hob Trolls.Even without the involvement of the Killer Skull Society, the troll would've started this war because the humans were getting stronger at a terrifying rate, and this wasn't good for goblins as well.They would've done this kind of slaughter to decrease the human population and cut down their experts.But Jacob also noticed something strange on his way here. Those trolls were collecting the blood of every human they killed in large containers and then sending them somewhere.Jacob mused it might be related to the realistic goal of the killer skull society to start this human slaughter.But he didn't want to get involved and looked the way. He knew since they could send someone as powerful as a dark elf here to oversee this propaganda, they would naturally not let anyone like Jacob interfere.However, Jacob also saw an opportunity in all this, but to grasp that opportunity he required much stronger power than he currently had, and that's why he came straight to this place to mix with the humans and stay far away from the war as long as possible.'I wonder if my old house is occupied as well…' Jacob looked in the direction of his luxurious mansion and squinted.He could hear many powerful heartbeats around the city, but instead of feeling flustered, his lips moved upward into a cold smirk.He jumped from the wall and landed on the ground. Without stopping, he headed toward lion street where his old mansion was!Soon, he reached the destination and saw the closed gate of many E-Rank and D-Rank mercenaries camping out the gates.'It seemed someone powerful had taken over the place after my renting time was over, and they even hired so many mercenary guards.'Jacob easily leaped over the thirty-meter-tall wall and entered the familiar garden.He saw the lights of the mansion were still up, and without hesitation, he headed toward it.Jacob also revealed his face, hid his hood within the collar, and knocked on the door. He didn't mind going from the window, but it would be meaningless since he couldn't remain hidden all the time.Since the new owner was still up, he decided to get it over with taking over this place.Soon, the doors opened, and a middle-aged man in butler clothes appeared.Jacob knew this man, he was the butler of this mansion, Harrison.Harrison was shocked when he saw Jacob's appearance and instantly recognized him with his silver hair."S-sir, you?" He was bewildered.Jacob has vanished for over a year now, and the new owner appeared recently after his renting contract was over.Even the head of the Gunsmith Guild once comes looking for Jacob, which shocked Harrison. But since he wasn't here, he left without saying anything.They even assumed Jacob was dead in the wilderness.Jacob had a good impression of Harrison and nodded. "Who is living here right now?"Harrison was snapped out of his stupor and sheepishly replied, "Sir, since you hadn't come back over a year, the landlord rented this house to a C-Rank Mercenary Group, and now it's their garrison place."Jacob didn't even frown and merely nodded. "Take me to their leader."Harrison was baffled by this comment, but Jacob had already entered the house and walked toward the hall.Harrison horridly followed and blurted, "Sir, it might not be a good idea. This Mercenary Group belongs to the Tiger's Den. A B-Rank Mercenary Group under a B-Rank mercenary command."They won't take it happily that you barged in like this and might take it as a provocation. Furthermore, I heard them talking that because of the war, the Tiger's Den dominant team might come here with their leader to lie low. You should leave while you can."Jacob chuckled when he heard Harrison's concerning words. He knew this guy was kind and really wanted him no harm."They're already here," Jacob said as he looked at the hall filled with eight people in their night clothes while holding different weapons and firearms.They were clearly not expecting some guests and were wary about the sudden knock on their door despite many guards outside. Those fellows were ordered to not allow anyone in, so whoever can break past their detection will not be anybody!Six of them were women, all of them were city-toppling beauties, and two guys were also tall and handsome.Furthermore, they were all C-Rank Mercenaries!Seeing Jacob's handsome appearance, those women's eyes lit up while the two men frowned, watching this unknown fellow walking like he owned this place and their butler following behind him with a worried expression."Harrison, is this your friend?" The dainty woman in a white nightgown questioned with her blue eyes affixed on Jacob's cold face.Harrison's heart palpitated when he saw those powerful figures gathering together at the same time. He was about to nod when Jacob spoke."I'm not anyone's friend. I was living before you guys in this place and was away for some time. But instead of waiting for my return, the landlord rented this place out." Jacob coolly stated.The tall man with blond hair frowned and coldly rebuked, "Punk, don't try this nonsense with us. You break into our house in the middle of the night, so you're not here to tell us your punk-ass story, right?" He suddenly pointed his rifle at Jacob while his finger was on the trigger."Yellow, don't shoot in the house, or I'll throw you out!" A tall, brown-haired woman with an hourglass figure and a fierce look on her pale white face threatened the blond guy named Yellow.Yellow trembled slightly and lowered his gun with an aggravated look on his face as he looked at Jacob.She then looked at Jacob, and her expression became icy, "Leave, or I'll kick your ass out of the lionheart city!"Everyone smiled wryly when they heard this as if they were accustomed to this woman's temper.However, Jacob looked the same and merely said one word laced with a ghastly intent, "KNEEL!"

Chapter 127 What Happened?
﻿"Kneel!"The moment this one worded sounded, the eight C-Rank mercenaries' hearts palpitated as their expression went appalled. Because they felt death from the bottom of their hearts from the silver hair man standing before them.Every sliver of their being was screaming in their head to do what they were told, or they will die horribly!'Thud…'The weapons in their trembling hands fell before their legs turned to jelly, and they fell on the floor, supporting themselves with their hands while their heads were down and their pale faces were filled with hazardousness.Harrison's eyes were as wide as they could get as he looked at this scene as if he was seeing a living dream. He didn't feel anything, but he could tell Jacob had used something to have made them kneel without putting any resistance.His entire view of Jacob upturned at this moment, and fear crept into his heart with reverence.Jacob coolly stated, "Now, I'm going to rest in my room. You guys can live here, just don't disturb me. Harrison, prepare my meal and deliver it to my room.""Y-yes." Harrison quickly bowed with his back filled with perspiration. He didn't dare to voice out any of his opinions anymore.Jacob nodded before he left toward the master bedroom without caring about those eight mercenaries, trembling as if they were in the middle of an icy lake.He merely showed his killing intent and a part of his strength, and they were all scared shitless.Even a Common Tier-12 Orc was scared away by him, much less these common tier-3 humans.Jacob knew the fastest way to subdue them was to show his might, and it worked like a charm. As a human, he knew very well how a mind of a human in power worked, and they won't simply back off unless they knew the opposite party was far superior to them. Unless they were simpletons seeking their death!After Jacob left, the eight of them felt like the looming death was left with him like a breeze.The woman with a fiery temper had an aghast expression. She looked at the space where Jacob just stood in befuddlement and mumbled hoarsely, "W-what just… happened exactly?!"It was a very fresh experience for them. Even their boss can't do what just Jacob does, and they can tell he didn't use any kind of poison, either.What just they felt and still lingering in their hearts was nothing but pure fear!The other man with short hair and bronze skin panted heavily as if he was suffocating and stood up. His legs were still trembling slightly. He bellowed, "J-just run!"He headed straight toward the door without even looking back for his companion.The others also looked at this back, and without thinking twice, they followed suit!Harrison, who was standing on the side, was shocked when he saw them fleeing without their luggage or weapons.He truly wondered what Jacob just did to make them like rats.A disgusting smell hit his nose all of a sudden as he looked at the spot where those eight were sitting, and he squinted when he saw eight wet spots on the carpet.Ashen, he hollered, "Someone quickly through this thing out before the lord smells this abhorrence!"---On the south of the Humane Kingdom, a graceful silhouette was standing on top of a tall building with an indignant look in her crimson eyes.A-9999, who finally fingered it out that Jacob wasn't in the underground facility after wasting a day, and a half, was now fuming with rage.She never thought that fellow would leave behind everything and run away the moment they left the area.Not only that, but he didn't leave behind any traces. Even someone like her, who took pride in tracking others, was completely clueless and failed to find Jacob's traces, no matter how and where she looked.In the end, she decided to head in the Rainy Mountain Ranges' direction, since if he wanted to leave, he had to cross that place no matter what. But there was a possibility he was still hiding somewhere in the three kingdoms' territory to lead them in circles.Perplexed, she had no choice but to scan through the entire humane kingdom just to make sure he wasn't there. Only then she would go back and search the other two kingdoms.If he wasn't here and left toward the rare region's direction, then the incoming members of the society will be able to intercept him. She just has to make sure he wasn't hiding anywhere near the three kingdoms, the common region even.Only then did they initiate the Cannibal Plan. It was also the order from higher-ups.At this moment, the Star Watch on her wrist vibrates, drawing her attention.'There's no user in this area.' She squinted her eyes with exasperation. She was using her Star Watch to find Jacob's star watch's corresponding signal. Since he was the only one with a star watch in this region, it was quite an effective method.Furthermore, she was confident that Jacob would not abandon the star watch with the map in it and the knowledge she transferred.Even if he did, she had to find the star watch to make it absolutely sure.As for the possibility of destroying it, everyone knew even if you burn a star watch to ashes, you can still find the last place it was activated before it got destroyed!That's what makes the star network scary and unfathomable!Nevertheless, she still took out another scanner, which was like a black box. Although this thing burns money, it was the most effective way to differentiate between species without them realizing it.Unless humans have set anti-radar systems in this place, no one will hide their species from this device.'Even if you grow wings, you can't hide from me!' A ruthless glint flashed past her eyes as she activated it!---The next morning,Jacob opened his eyes when the first ray of sun hit the world. He wasn't feeling any fatigue and was refreshed after he got to take a break from all that traveling and potion refining.He exited his room without wearing his shirt and headed directly toward the pool area.'I should be able to do it this time.' Expectation shone in Jacob's eyes as he thought about the two hours limit of Water Meditation.The last he practiced the Water Meditation was exactly in this place, and never thought he would continue it in this place again.If he hadn't found the Dark City and crossed into the rare region, he might've never returned to this place.But it seemed he still had some kind of fate with this place, which just won't allow him to leave.Without caring about the water temperature, he dived straight into it and started the water meditation.He crossed the one-hour threshold with little difficulty, and the 10-G pressure on him now felt like normal gravity with his current prowess.As he reached the two-hour point, he still had over half his breath remaining.The moment the two hours threshold was crossed, just as Jacob expected, the G-force increased the very moment, and he finally felt the pressure.Even the floor below him began to crack.'So, this is 20-G force!' Jacob could still handle it, and it wasn't enough to make him alarmed. But it was enough to make him finally feel suffocation.Nevertheless, Jacob knew he could last 30 or 40 minutes more, even with this suffocation and pressure.However, when the five minutes pass, Jacob felt a strange tingling sensation around his body.But this sensation only lasted for 2 or 3 seconds before it vanished, and the next moment the pressure on Jacob also vanished completely!Jacob's eyes snapped open with a hint of bewilderment, he stood up.'What happened?'Yet at this moment, thereafter, the water in the pool suddenly started to turn into smoke and discharged into the air!Jacob instantly knew what caused this sudden change. 'The oxygen was completely removed from the water, and now hydrogen had nothing to bond it together, so it turned into its natural state!'As for what caused this change, it might be that sensation I felt, and the G-force also broke because of the oxygen's exhaustion. I have already run some tests in my old life, and the oxygen indeed got exhausted every time we practiced Water Mediation. Or there's something more to it.'Did this mean if I want to continue this technique, I need a vaster water body with every increase in gravity?'That sensation made my cells cheer for a moment, which meant it was good for even someone like me. Just what kind of technique is this Art of nature, and what is its end goal?'Jacob mused with a grave expression. He no longer dared to belittle this unknown technique from his old world.However, his thought process stagnated with a deafening roar, "Bastard, come out!"

Chapter 128 Tiger’s Den
﻿Samuel was one of four B-Rank Mercenaries of the Humane Kingdom and enjoyed status as high as a Duke of the kingdom.Unlike most people, Samuel's family was an Earl Rank Family, and with their support, he joined Star Mercenary Agency. He was extremely talented and ambitious.In three decades, he finally broke into the ranks of B-Rank Mercenaries.After he was granted his own fief close to the royal capital like other B-Rankers. He then made his mercenary group Tiger's Den into a self-sufficient company and started annexing talented mercenaries all around the kingdom into the company.Unlike other B-Rank Mercenaries who wanted to live a carefree life, Samuel wanted to leave the uncommon region and head to the rare region to see the other side. But he didn't want to join the black knights despite the Marshal's personal invitation.He likes freedom and the person being in control. So, he started to nurture his own team and wanted to make them all B-rankers, so their journey would become smoother.He was extremely cautious and didn't dare to underestimate the path toward the rare region.Everything was going great before this unjust war happened with the Earthen Kingdom and after experiencing the troll kingdom's prowess himself. He knew it was hopeless for the Humane Kingdom.So, like others, he retreated into the Gloria Contrary in the sham of a fake injury.Furthermore, from his company informers, he found one of the four C-Rank Mercenary Team under him had a vast mansion in the Lionheart City, which was close to the Rainy Mountain Ranges.So, he instantly went there and summoned every C-Rank Team there as well.He was planning to bring everyone into the Rainy Mountain Rages to raise his own survival chances when he traveled toward the Rare Region.However, when he came this morning, he found out some punk used a strange trick to scare the mercenary team under his company and 'captured' the mansion.Which made him and other members of Tiger's Den's dominant team infuriated, and with over 100 members in tow, Samuel barged into the mansion with killing intent.He let loose a deafening roar, "Bastard, come out!"Every member behind him was holding cold weapons and firearms.Amid this group was a team of eight. Their expressions were filled with lingering fears as they looked at the mansion with uncertainty.These eight were naturally the ones who Jacob scared silly into peeing in their pants and made them flee despite didn't want them to.They were called the Fiery Lake Mercenary Group, a famous C-Rank Mercenary group that joined the Tiger's Den a few years ago and become more famous.Their leader was a brown-haired woman with a fiery temper. Everyone called her Fiery Lake because of her enthralling beauty and fiery temper.But that bold, fiery look couldn't be seen in Fiery Lake's beautiful eyes anymore. As she vividly remembered what happened last night.However, she was still uncertain about what happened at that time, even though she believed that silver head man tricked them and made a fool of themselves.But she was still fearful for some reason, and if not for Samuel's presence, she would never return here, even if she was uncertain about the last night's events.At the very front, a 6'1 tall burly man donned skin-tight armor, and two battle axes attached to his back were coldly looking at the mansion with his black eyes. His square bronze skin face, with short black hair, gives him a handsome look. He was Samuel, a B-Rank Mercenary and Boss of Tiger's Den Company!"Whose dog is barking in the wee hours?" A sulky voice rang at this moment before the mansion's door opened. Jacob appeared wearing an unbuttoned white shirt and black pants.When the ladies in the group saw Jacob's appearance and his tone-ripped pale body, their eyes lit up. He was hundreds of times more handsome than Samuel.A long black hair woman was standing right behind Samuel. It was as if she was carved out of flawless snow-white jade. Her slim and supple waist was exposed slightly under her tight, soft armor. Despite that armor, her towering chest and sexy exposed collarbone were a sight to behold.With a height of 6 feet, she looked completely out of place, as if she was placed in a group of swine. She was no doubt the most beautiful woman in this group and aloof.She was the vice president and vice-captain of Tiger's Den; Alice. She was very close to entering the B-Rank.Alice was quite interested in the person who dared to chase out the members of Tiger's Den and still didn't run.However, when she heard Jacob's arrogant words, she instantly thought this was some idiot who didn't fear death or didn't know who he was messing with.But now that she saw him, even she had to admit he was the most handsome man she had ever seen in her life. She was a duke's heir, and she met with princes; they weren't Jacob's match.'He's going to die… it's a pity he's a fool,' She thought coldly when she was Samuel trembled when he heard Jacob's words.Samuel has a hideous expression after being called a dog by this pretty boy, and now he's showing off his body while pretending he doesn't exist. It intensified his killing intent.Especially when he felt Alice's gaze. He already considered Alice his personal property and someone only he could court, so now it was personal.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "Since you dare to snatch my thing, I'll send you on your way." Samuel coldly uttered while he moved his hand toward the axes on his back.Jacob's expressions were impassive as he looked at Samuel and let him draw his axes."How about this? I'll take one of your arms because of the disturbance you just caused." Jacob uttered as if he was giving an absolute verdict.Harrison and the other servants watching this drama were gobsmacked by Jacob's words, as did everyone else.A skinny guy with revolvers in his hand bellowed while pointing his gun at Jacob, "Boss, let me rip off his sharp tongue for you!"He was Shooter, another vice-captain of the Tiger's Den mercenary group."Heh, Vice-Captain, don't you see the boss's expression? He's going to chop that guy into mincemeat. Just enjoy the show." Another member of the tiger's den sneered darkly.Alice remained expressionless while she looked at Jacob with uncertainty in her watery emerald eyes."DIE!" Samuel roared as he charged at Jacob with 80 MP/h speed and hacked his axe toward Jacob's shoulder with an icy smile. He now wanted to make Jacob beg for death, not kill him directly.Jacob was also unarmed, which made him even bolder, and he didn't feel any kind of danger from Jacob, or he won't charge like this.Although it looked like Samuel was rash, the fact was, he had already probed Jacob's prowess in his behavior. Well, in his mind, at least.However, what happened next made everyone's jaw drop in the group.'Thud…'Samuel's axe suddenly landed right between Jacob's index and middle finger and was stuck then and there!Samuel's eyes went wide as his face started to turn pale when he comprehended what had just happened. He tried to retrace his axe, but it didn't even budge.He quickly used the second axe to chop down on Jacob's forearm. Furthermore, he wanted to cut it off.However, to his surprise, Jacob didn't even move his finger to black it and let it land on his forearm.But what happened next made Samuel and everyone watching gobsmacked with horror!They saw the axe powerfully land on Jacob's forearm, and it should be enough to chop his arm off, but not only his arm was as sturdy as ever, but the blade only cut his shirt and barely grazed his skin."Is that all?" Jacob's snide voice sounded, sending chills down everyone's spine while making Samuel scared silly.Samuel finally understand at this moment that Jacob wasn't an idiot, but he was!From the start to finish, Jacob didn't show any fear. It wasn't because he didn't know about him, or he had a screw loss on his head, but Jacob didn't consider him a threat at all. He was probably like a child throwing a tantrum in Jacob's eyes.Appalled, "Wh-who are…" before he could speak another word, Jacob's other hand moved like a blur at this moment. and grabbed Samuel's other shoulder.Jacob coldly uttered, "I'll be taking this arm as I said."Before Samuel could struggle, he felt gripped by an iron claw, and the next moment, "Ahhhhhhhhhh…"His blood-curdling, hysteric shrill rang and was heard by the entire lion street.The mercenaries of the tiger's den witness a ghastly sight with pale faces at this moment.Their valorous leader's hand was torn like a rag doll by this terrifying guy. and blood flowed like a small fountain from Samuel's mangled shoulder while he was screaming in pain like a pig!

Chapter 129 A-Rank?
﻿It was a gruesome scene, as they watched the silver-haired man impassively holding the severed arm with bloodstains all over his white shirt and body while his victim was screaming right before him. He looked nothing less than a devil."Sh… s-shot him down!" Samuel shrieked with bloodshot eyes as he suppressed the appalling pain.The Tiger's Den Mercenaries snapped out of their stupor, and their faces were ghastly pale. They all hesitated because Jacob was more powerful than Samuel. No, he was too powerful!What if he decided to kill them all if they retaliates? Right now, Jacob only tore Samuel's arm and didn't kill him, which he easily could. No one doubted it anymore.But if they really went on this road, there will be no return for them anymore.Furthermore, when everyone saw the 'Devil' was just standing there calmly and looked at them with his icy eyes without any hint of panic, they all felt palpitations in their hearts.But if they didn't shoot, didn't Samuel won't let them off?Just as some of them collected their courage and starts raising their firearms, Alice's crisp voice rang, "Stand down!"Her face was paler than anyone on the scene because she had this astonishing yet impossible proposition in her mind, 'He's an A-Rank!'Because of her background, she was far more informative than anyone, and she heard lots of legends about an A-Rank expert, and this man in front of them was nothing but like those legends!The moment Jacob tore off Samuel's hand like he was tearing a dry leaf, this realization hit her. She never thought there was someone with an A-rank mercenary strength hidden among humans.Since Samuel dared to offend him, he was courting death, but what about them who came with him?Her heart beat wildly just at the thought of it, and now Samuel had given a suicide command. She knew just how shrewd Samuel was, and he might've already guessed what she does, and he wanted to use them as a distraction so he could escape.But when she noticed Jacob remain expressionless and remained in his position, she was even more sure these kinds of bullets would not work on him, and they would be seeking their own death once they start firing.So, she instantly stopped those fools.Jacob's lips suddenly curled into an amusing smirk as he looked at the tall beauty. He had to admit she was probably the most beautiful woman he had seen from the day he was born in this world.But what aroused his interest was her decision-making in this chaotic situation, and she was thinking about her survival just like this fool who wanted to take everyone with him for a chance to escape.Although Samuel and Alice were the same kinds of people, Jacob could tell this woman was ten times savvier and calmer than Samuel.'Well, since she'll be more obedient, I don't need this one.' Jacob's eyes turned cold as he looked at Samuel, who was seething in pain, or pretending to as his bloodshot eyes were darting around.Since Alice blocked his life path, he won't let them live either. He roared hysterically, "Bitch, do you really think he'll let you all go?! Don't listen to her attack… attack for me!"Alice had already noticed Jacob's smirk, and her heart was beating like a drum.When she heard this and couldn't help but cursed out loud, "This scoundrel dog wanted us to die with him! Don't listen and drop your weapon. We're not matched for this gentleman, he's an A-Rank!""A… A rank?"Everyone's minds jumbled when they heard A-Rank, and they finally understood why Samuel was beaten so miserably!Compared to a B-Rank Samuel, who had already offended an A-Rank expert, they would choose to surrender and earn this powerhouse's forgiveness. Even the most loyal original Tiger's Den members have the same thoughts, and the very next moment, they all dropped their weapons without any hint of hesitation."W-we surrender!""It was Samuel's fault and… and… they were also the ones who took him here!"Everyone turned and pointed toward the Fiery Lake Team of Eight with indignant eyes.If it wasn't for these eight, would they come here?The answer was yes!Because Samuel had already considered this mansion his hideout until the war with the trolls would decide and even bought it from the original owner. So, they would've come here even without them.But to save their own skins, they put all the blame on them and hoped Jacob would spare their life.They never thought there would be an even scarier existence than the entire Earthen Kingdom residing in this barren country, and they just had to offend him!It was all because of one fucking mansion!The Fiery Lake Team's faces were ashen when they saw everyone pointing at them and distancing themselves from them.Despair filled Fiery Lake's beautiful eyes at this moment. She regretted reporting this incident to Samuel and deciding to stay here.Now it was all over, their comrades had abandoned them!Samuel also found hope amid darkness when he heard this. He quickly blurted, "L-Lord, yes… it was all them…"At this moment Jacob annoyingly spoke, "Enough!"The scene felt deadly silent.Jacob scanned through the crowd with his cold eyes before his eyes paused for a moment on the Fiery Lake Team and then he stopped at Alice, which made her shudder.He impassively asked, "You will be the leader of these clowns from now on, and if anyone dares to run… your end will be…"Just as his icy voice trailed off.His hand blurred again, only this time when it appeared again, it was coated with blood, and it wasn't empty, but there was a beating heart in his hand.Everyone felt terror when they looked at the heart, which, beat by beat, turned dormant.'Thud.'When they heard this sound, a chill ran down their spine because Samuel was laying in his own blood without any hint of life, and there was a hole in his chest.'Squish…'Jacob clenched Samuel's heart and coldly said, "This could be any of your heart, so I'm suggesting to not try anything funny, or I'll hear you."Alice, who was looking at Samuel's corpse with an appalled expression, also felt terror and didn't dare to look Jacob in the eyes anymore."You'll be Salve No.1 from now, and your first task is to make the pool in the backyard a hundred meters deep with a solid platform in the center and build a doom over it. Is that clear?" Jacob coldly uttered while glaring at Alice.Without waiting for her reply, he turned around, about to leave before he left one last line, "Every woman will live in the mansion 'with me' from now on, while men can make camps outside and be in charge of security. If anyone approached, tell them to fuck off."Harrison looked at the incoming Jacob with daze and terror, as well as the other servants of the house. They all thought it was just a dream.They never thought they were serving someone so powerful all this time!Jacob looked at Harrison meaningfully, which made the latter shudder. "You'll be in charge of those people and the materials they required, and if they resist your orders, tell me."Harrison felt like his knees were trembling and urged to release the pressure between his legs, but he didn't dare, afraid he will be lost Jacob's goodwill and had his heart crushed like Samuel's."As your command, my lord!" He quickly bent his head ninety degrees.Jacob didn't mind and left.The entire purpose of putting this show in everyone's eyes was to put fear in everyone's heart as well as announced his existence among humans.Furthermore, he really required some labor to make the pool deeper so he could continue practicing water meditation. These people happened to be just what he needed, and Samuel delivered them to him.'Now, I just have to remain here and wait for their reactions. If I thought correctly, this might really work…' An astute glint flashed past Jacob's eyes as he headed toward the basement.Alice looked at the empty space where Jacob was just standing a few moments ago. 'S-slave No.1?!'Those words rang in her mind like thunder. She, a proud daughter of a Duke, was proclaimed a slave, and she can't even put up resistance or word out of her protest!It was simply a tremendous blow to her pride and confidence!Everyone has complicated expressions on their faces. They never thought their entire understanding of power would be upturned by coming to this place.Although Jacob called their Vice-Captain in slave, what about them?He called them clowns; they weren't even considered slaves to him. and all the pride and achievement they had accumulated in these years turned into smoke.As for escaping, did they have the ability?

Chapter 130 Silver Tyrant
 ﻿The incident with Tiger's Den wasn't something that could remain hidden.Some of the neighbors around Jacob's mansion witness the entire incident played out with aghast expressions.No one thought a B-Rank Mercenary, the symbol of power in the Humane Kingdom, would die so tragically.But the biggest news out of it was the possibility of an A-Rank expert present between humans!In this state of hopeless war, this news was like a windfall for the Humane Kingdom. Because if this was true and they really had an A-Rank expert amidst them, then trolls would be the first ones trembling in fear.One had to know between the three kingdoms, there wasn't a single A-Rank expert present, and neither did they know about the existence of Dark City.Very soon, this news spread like wildfire from lion street to lionheart city, then within half a day, the entire Gloria Country was shocked.In one day, Jacob's existence was known to every person with status!Since no one knows his name, everyone starts calling him Silver Tyrant because of his eye-catching hair color and for his tyrannical display with Tiger's Den.Rumors have it that the Silver Tyrant would crush anyone's heart who opposed him with his bare hands, while he was also a debaucher, and every night he slept with hundreds of women.The proud daughter of Duke Riley and the most beautiful woman of the Humane Kingdom, Alice Riley, was captured by Silver Tyrant and now had become his personal slave.More and more exaggerated rumors spread between humans and Silver Tyrant became even more famous than the war between the two kingdoms!---The throne hall of the Humane Kingdom Royal Palace was bristling with activities at this moment.Just a day ago, this place was gloomy because of the impending danger of trolls.However, today the atmosphere was filled with hope, and many high-ranking officers who were secretly planning their desertion were also present. Even some already deserted nobles were back.On the golden throne, a handsome middle-aged with long, shining golden hair supporting a matching golden crown was sitting with an expressionless face while his light blue eyes have a hint of exhaustion.He was the third King of the Humane Kingdom, King Philip III!With a platform below Philip, sat three prices and a princess as well as their mother, the Queen Consort. The entire main royal bloodline was present today!There were also two tall men clad in golden armor standing right behind the King's Throne with expressionless faces, but the aura they were giving was extremely imposing.Philip slightly nodded his head while looking at the bristling throne room.The next moment, the royal guard behind him loudly stated, "In the name of his Majesty, I command everyone to be reticent!"The next moment, the entire throne hall fell into silence, and they all looked toward their King with myriad emotions.They all knew today was going to go down in the concise history of the Humane Kingdom.Philip expressionlessly scanned through the entire throne room and looked at every person present today.Many nobles lower their head when they felt Philip's cold eyes on them.Philip, however, didn't bring up those skedaddle acts and looked at the burly man who has a fierce face and sat straight at the very front of the left row.He impassively asked, "Marshal Galant, you have a report to make, I presumed?"Marshal Galant was the strongest person in the Humane Kingdom and the commander of the Royal Army. He was even more respected and famous than the Humane King!With Galant's prowess, he could've easily dethroned the Grover Family from their royal status, but he was always faithful to the crown.Not only that, but he was their biggest supporter, and that's how the Grover Family was still in a commanding position, or with rising powers of different factions, the Grover Family would've lost their hold on the Humane Kingdom long ago.Especially the Riley Family under Philip's younger brother's control.The Riley Duke not only roped in the B-Rank Samuel into his household with his charming daughter, but that daughter was extremely talented, and she was very close to entering the B-Rank herself.It could easily upturn the entire Humane Kingdom's political structure. However, now…Galant politely replied with a complicated glint in his eyes as he looked at his King, who seemed to have grown older after the last time he saw him."Your Majesty, this subject indeed has an important report." He took a deep breath and continued, "The trolls suddenly stopped attacking our borders and even abandoned our already conquered cities and territories last night. Right now, their armies are on standby at their border. While we also noticed all the B-Rank trolls were summoned back to protect their King. They're even willing to talk now…"Galant was really marveling right now as he reported these astonishing reports. It was like he was repeating a dream. He never thought that the stubborn troll army who wanted to exterminate every human backed off because of a simple rumor…Philip didn't have any emotions when he heard it as if has expected this.He said with acerbity, "All of this just because… Silver Tyrant's appearance, yes?"The entire throne room was deadly silent when they heard this name. They all knew about it before coming here.The trolls retreat because of the possibility of an A-Rank expert appearing amidst humans, it might change the entire power structure of the uncommon region.Although it was still unclear why the Silver Tyrant showed his face only now, one thing is clear, just his presence was enough to make humans the strongest power between the three kingdoms!At least that is what everyone in this hall thought.That's why some cowards dared to crawl back from their hideouts.Everyone knew things were going to change in a very prominent way for humans!Galant sighed and lowered his head before he said, "Yes, your highness. Both goblins and trolls were now secretly inquiring about Silver Tyrant, and many spies were found."Galant was also one of the few who know just how difficult it was to enter the A-rank and what kind of status these beings had in the rare region. He was a reserved member of Nightmare Knights Legion, and he wasn't even qualified to become a full fledge member.Now, this A-Rank expert appeared out of nowhere, and he also was quite young. He was really baffled by this news and almost spat blood in frustration.He was used to revering by everyone here, but after the Silver Tyrant appeared, those who knows about his prowess no longer looked at him as an absolute being anymore.Even he's also afraid of Silver Tyrant because he clearly knows how difficult it was to beat Samuel even for him, but this monster killed him like he was killing a chicken.Many people witnessed this scene while the entire Tiger's Den powerful experts were working like constructors at Silver Tyrant's place obediently. There's no room for doubting this information.At this moment, a middle-aged man with a great resemblance to Philip stood up with a grave expression on his face.He said while deeply looking at Philip who was already expecting this, "My King, we all wanted to hear, what is your stance on this matter?"Philip's lips suddenly rose slightly into a mocking smile. "First, I want to hear Duke Riley's stance. I heard Silver Tyrant kill your 'Son-in-Law' as well as enslaved your cherished daughter, and many terrible rumors about her are all over the kingdom. Do you intend to march your army there and seek justice? If yes, I'll lend you a hand, since she's my niece as well."Everyone's expression stiffened when they heard this and lowered their heads.If there were another hot topic besides the Silver Tyrant, then it would be Alice Riley.She was already crowned as the kingdom's most beautiful woman, and now she was raised to be a mere slave of Silver Tyrant.It was an enormous blow to her and Riley Family's reputation.Duke Riley's expression went rigid when he heard this, and clenched his hands tightly.How could he not want to march his entire army there and save his daughter?But whenever he thought about how dangerous that fellow Silver Tyrant was that even Samuel was toyed to death by him. He felt chills on his spine and didn't dare to think of revenge anymore.Although he had ulterior motives when he sent Alice to the Tiger's Den company to win over Samuel, Alice had proven to be as talented as Samuel in these years, so he no longer belittled his daughter.However, Samuel had gone and sought his own death, and now Alice fell victim, and he could do nothing, which made him indignant.He suppressed his urge to punch his brother in the face, and stiffly said, "I won't dare to cause my King trouble. It's Alice's fortune to catch the interest of our Kingdom's first A-rank expert."A ruthless glint shimmered in his eyes at this moment, "Now, I would like to know how my King will approach Silver Tyrant!"
