Chapter 271 Black Sea Company
Jacob looked at the map in front of him with shining eyes and a faint smile, "Who would've thought I would get this map so easily? Now, I don't have to worry about my traveling problem. But now I have to kill those guys since that woman still has some use." He muttered with derision.Although this mission seemed quite deadly, killing a mercenary who could become a permanent member of the bank won't be someone easy to kill. But for Jacob, he just needed to lure them outside the dark city before turning them into ZC.Not only he profited from this, but he also got two important maps from a reliable source.'Now the question is when should I get rid of those guys?' Killing intent flashed past his eyes. Since Lucy wanted to kill him, he won't show mercy as well.The next day, Jacob left the alchemy guild after twenty months and headed toward the market of the inner circle for a stroll.The moment he started walking on the street, Jacob instantly felt multiple eyes on him, but he didn't react and pretended to be ignorant.Jacob was heading toward a special building which a black sailboat logo on its front, and written under the logo was 'Black Sea Company.'The reason he came to this place was naturally to buy a ship, and another reason being he was quite familiar with their product as well. Because he used the Black Ship of their company to travel in the rare plains as well, but it was stolen goods, so he had to return it back.Furthermore, since this company can open in the inner circle of the dark city, then it couldn't be normal at all.That's why after asking around, he found this place, and he must say it was only inferior to three hegemonies buildings.Without hesitation, he walked within the building and entered a large expansion, lavishly decorated with different ship statues.An elvish woman approached Jacob with a smile as she greeted him, "Welcome, gentleman. How may I help you today?""I want a treasure ship." Jacob impassibly answered."Do you have any rank preferences?" asked the elf without hiding her elation.She knew the Treasure Ship Jacob was refereeing to were ranked ships that were made of treasure materials. Anyone who could buy a treasure ship in this place had to be a big shot so she could get a large commission if she managed to sell a high-quality, expensive product."I want at least an Advance Type-1 treasure ship, but I want it small, around the range of 10 meters. Money is not a problem." Jacob stated as he had already thought about what kind of ship he wanted.The biggest requirement was that the ship should be able to fit in his pendant.The elf woman's eyes lit up as she instantly knew it was going to be her lucky day, "Please follow me. I'll inform the manager!"Jacob nodded and followed her into a private room. He didn't have to wait before a demi-human with foxy features entered the room wearing a white suit, followed by the same elf woman who brought him here."My name is Reuben, and I'm the manager of this branch. How may I address esteem, sir?" Reuben politely introduced himself to Jacob."Jack." Jacob plainly answered.Reuben wasn't bothered by Jacob's lack of response since everyone in this place was mostly eccentrics."My associate here told me you want a treasure ship with at least Advance-Type-1 rank?" He asked with a big smile.And when Jacob nodded in affirmation, he quickly said, "In that case, I would like to confirm one thing, which type of payment are you going to use? I must inform you, sir Advance Type-1 ships only sell using a special type of currency, and without it, I'm afraid I can't sell you Intermediate or Advance Type-1 ships. It's star network's policy. I hope you won't take offense."Ruben was telling the truth. In fact, any treasure above basic type-1 could not be bought by using only gold coins, no matter how much someone had.This rule was implanted because these treasures were too powerful, not to mention very difficult to make, so the Star Network created this policy so only someone with ZC could buy them, not just any random tom, dick, or harry.Jacob also knew what this guy was asking by not speaking the name out loud, so he coolly replied, "Zodiac Credit." Reuben's smile widened, "In that case, I have three ships that suit your demand, Sir. Please have a look." He quickly activated his star watch before three ships' projections materialized in the air.He pointed at the white ship and said, "This white ship, size 9.6 meters is an Advance Type-1 treasure ship, and its speed is 500Mph, with an Advance Type-1 magic barrier function, autopilot, Star Watch controller, navigation, and advance type-1 sea scanner. Its price is 900 ZC."Then he pointed at the golden ship, which had silver markings on it, "This Golden Ship, size 10.2 meters, not only has all the white ship functions, but it also has Advance Type-1 magic scanner as well and a magic cannon which could be controlled manually by star watch controller. Its price is 1500 ZC."Lastly, he pointed at the dark blue ship with black markings, but this ship looked like a flat triangle, not a ship."This Stealth Triangle, size 5.9 meters, is two passengers Ship, and it has every function of the aforementioned ships except the magic canon. But it was done because this ship's true specialty lies within its stealth function and speed."The stealth function can make it hide under the detection of extraordinary creatures and any Advance Type-1 scanners. At the same time, its speed is Mach 1. The price of the Stealth triangle is 3000 ZC!" Reuben stated as he looked at Jacob, who was silently listening to his introduction.Jacob looked at all three ships before his eyes stopped at the stealth triangle eventually. Not only was this ship small, but its size was also quite to his liking. Furthermore, he didn't need any cannons as long as he could remain hidden.The star ocean was too dangerous, so having stealth was more important than having firepower.So, he impassively stated, "I will take this stealth triangle and make it black if you could!"

Chapter 272 Earth Great Minor & Dark Moon Of Beast Forest
Jacob left the Black Sea Company with a content look in his eyes, and Reuben even walked him to the gates with a very respectful expression.Afterward, Jacob started to stroll the market while looking at materials available from different vendors. He was just trying his luck to see if he found any materials for the array.In the end, Jacob didn't find anything, and he wasn't surprised since even the alchemy guild, which was the biggest dealership of materials, didn't have them. The chances of others having them were even less.However, Jacob also had another purpose for doing this. He was making his presence known to his watchers and wanted to draw as many as possible.In the evening, Jacob returned to the alchemy guild and opened his inbox to see the messages he received when he was out in the market but didn't bother to reply. He even received a few calls, which he also ignored, and he had some idea who they were from.Just as he suspected, the calls were from Great Earth Minor.With a cold smile, he opened the reply of Great Earth Minor.'Great Earth Minor (Reply): So, you finally decided to show your face?!'Great Earth Minor (Reply): You give me your location I'll come to you!'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Why aren't you replying?'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Alright, let's meet in the Dark City's alchemy guild in two weeks!'Jacob sneered when he saw those messages, 'He's replying to his own questions. Well, I expected no less from a desperate dying idiot. But does he really think he still has the initiative anymore?'Jacob started to write his reply.Somewhere in the beast forest,Two figures were hovering in two glass cells filled with black liquid. One of them was a fox face orc, while the other was a brown hobgoblin. Both of them were extremely skinny as if someone had drained all blood from their bodies.At this moment, the star watch on the hobgoblin's wrist vibrates before he opens his beastly green eyes and looks at the message he just received.'Faceless Ancient (Reply): I can't come to the dark city. Select another place, and it has to be closer to the best forest, and I'll come when I have time. If you don't want to wait, then forget about it. If you agree, then reply, and if you spout any nonsense or rush me, I'll block you, and you will never be heard from me again. Don't even think of a second that I need you. You need me, so get your mind straight before you reply to me. This is your last chance!'Killing intent started to rage in the hobgoblin's eyes, but he suppressed his urge to write a curse back and press a button within the glass cell before the black liquid started to sink.The fox face orc also sensed something and opened its foxy eyes, and when he saw the hobgoblin was about to come out, he also pressed the button to exit the glass cell.After getting a clear look at the hobgoblin's ugly yet pale expression, the orc seemed to guess the reason behind it as he asked, "Mason, did that prick reply?"Mason, who was none other than Earth Great Minor, didn't reply and only pressed his star watch a few times before a projection of Jacob's message materialized in front of the orc.When the orc saw this, his expression also turned nasty like Mason, and he spat in an extremely eerie voice, "What an arrogant bastard! What should we do?"Mason hoarsely refuted, "Lucas, you motherfucker, you still dare to call others arrogant and ask me what to do? When I'm in this damnable state because of you!"Lucas, who was none other than Dark Moon of Beast Forest, couldn't help but smile bitterly because he knew Mason was right.When, twenty months ago, Jacob didn't tell Mason about the plutonium. He turned to Lucas, who quickly agreed to Mason's demand and even invited him to his lab to research the material together.In truth, even Lucas didn't know the true properties of Plutonium, and he was so eager to get his hands on it because he had an old picture of plutonium with only one description, 'Intermediate Type-2 Material.'This picture was something he found in an abandoned lab in the south of rare plains, and not only this picture but the entire research data of an explosive expert, and with that exact data Lucas became what he was today.That's why when Lucas saw the plutonium in the market, he wanted to get his hands on it to see if it was really the same material in the picture. Because it was, he could become rich.Furthermore, by Mason's interest in it, Lucas guessed that he had more than what he was showing. So, he became greedy and decided to lure Mason here by the lure of researching together. But he didn't tell him about that silver being intermediate type-2 material.Mason was also greedy, so he decided to agree with Lucas's invitation since he wasn't losing anything, and once he got a keen grasp over what kind of material it was, then he could sell it and gain huge profits from it.However, none of them had thought that things would go south the moment they started experimenting with that piece of plutonium, and within a few months, they started to experience grave symptoms.First, they thought nothing of them and ate some random healing pills to alleviate those symptoms. However, they soon found how wrong they were when they started coughing blood, and their conditions turned worse.It was at that time Mason started to understand the meaning behind Jacob's subtle words and tried contacting him, but he never received any reply.Now, their condition was so worse that if they couldn't contain their bodies within type-1 healing liquid for eight hours, they would feel pain worse than death, and their life would start slipping away. They can't even breathe properly anymore.They were at the end of their ropes and were about to head to the dark city alchemy guild to seek help from the alchemy guild when Jacob finally responded.However, they had lost all the initiative over him, and now they could do nothing but play on the palm of his hand. "I know, I was being greedy, but don't forget you were already experiencing light symptoms when you came here, which means the exposure to this metal was also as deadly as experimenting on it. The process just became faster."So, we should stop blaming each other and do something about our condition before we turn into living corpses. We can still stick to our plan and go seek the seniors' help, or we can take the risk by inviting this guy here. Although it's risky, I'm confident he won't be able to do anything to us as long as he enters my base… cough… cough…" Lucas suddenly started coughing violently as drops of blood were mixed within his saliva spared over his hand.Mason's expression became extremely dark as he also stopped the urge to cough and weakly nodded, "Alright. I think this guy, cough…, is more reliable since he knew the symptoms. So, I'll give him the location of this base. But we should also be ready just in case the negotiation fails."Lucas smiled coldly, "Don't worry. Although we get this mysterious illness, we still manage to create a weapon out of that deadly material. If he knew how dangerous this material is, I'm sure he won't try anything funny!"Mason nodded with a grim expression as he started typing…!

Chapter 273 A Wanted Man
In the noble circle of the dark city,A masked man sitting behind a long chair was looking at the black-cloaked figure in the hologram in front."So, that rat finally left his hole, huh?" He coldly asked with a hint of ecstasy in his voice.The person in the hologram replied in a raspy tone, "Indeed. After months of waiting three days ago, that guy finally decided to leave the alchemy guild building. But he goes back after wasting half a day in the market.""At least, it's confirmed he's still in the dark city and hiding in the alchemy guild. Tell me, what did he do in the market?" The masked man asked coldly.The cloaked figure in hologram respectfully replied, "The only place he remained for more than five minutes is in the Black Sea Company. He stayed there for almost an hour. After bribing the assistant there, I found he bought an advance type-1 treasure ship for 3000 ZC.""3000 ZC, huh? It seemed the information about him robbing the senior grandmaster alchemists was not wrong." The masked man muttered with a hint of shock before he said, "Speaking of information, do you find how Skull No. A-2 was killed? Did that dog get exposed and put down by this prick?""The thing is, Lord A-0, we didn't have connections in the Senior Grandmaster circle of the alchemy guild after A-2 was killed twenty months ago before sending us the details about Faceless Ancient's actions."But I have some connections in the Grandmaster circle. According to my source, Senior Grandmaster Otto only vanished after Faceless Ancient left the guild for the inner circle."Furthermore, that guy had already killed a Senior Grandmaster before he left, and since he is still living in the dark city, then it means it shouldn't be him who killed A-2."Other than that, I have no new intel about his uncanny death. Even his brain chip didn't contain any information, which was quite strange. Even a Star Hacker isn't capable of doing such a thing to our brain chip." The cloaked figure replied with uncertainty.The masked man or Skull No. A-0 sighed ruefully at this moment, "After our hasty retreat from the freedom plains while leaving our investment behind, the death of a single-digit A-rank skull has made the higher-ups in the epic plains furious."We are not allowed to enter the epic plains without getting our hands on the research data from that hateful rat. So, I don't need to tell you just how important this mission is for both of our futures, right A-1?" asked A-0 meaningfully.A-1 nodded his cloaked head and gravely said, "Don't worry, Lord A-0, I have put all the two-digit agents in the dark city in this mission. The moment we get the chance, I, as well as the other nine, will personally take action and get the data back."No. A-0 nodded his head in acknowledgment, "Very well, I will wait for your good news. Just don't underestimate that rat. He's too strange and always manages to surprise us. I don't want any mishap this time, or you and I both won't be able to handle the consequences.""Understood!" A-1 solemnly uttered before his figure vanished from the projection.A-0 then connected another call, and a dark projection materialized, and a melodious yet icy voice rang, "You better be calling me to tell me that you have recovered the data?""Madam, please rest assured, everything is under control now. As long as that Faceless Ancient leaves the dark city, he will not be able to escape." A-0 no longer appeared arrogant as he spoke with this 'Madam.'"I've been hearing this excuse for what, about two years now?" The woman tonelessly remarked."But madam, this time, I think he's going to leave the dark city. We just discovered that target had bought a treasure ship from the Black Sea company. So, this could only mean he was going to the great star river or star ocean. As long as he leaves the dark city, it doesn't matter where he goes. He won't escape our grasp!" He quickly assured.The woman remained silent for a moment before she coldly spoke, "For what you've done in the Freedom Plains, I will give you two more years to retrieve the date. If you fail, then you have to return with all the acquired assets. But you won't be rewarded as handsomely as it was originally planned, and someone else might not let off this chance to take your position as '0'." Done stating her piece, she disconnected the call without waiting for A-0's reply!A-0 was momentarily stunned. An extremely sinister aura flashed over his person before it vanished. His hands were clenched so tightly that his bloodlessness was on the verge of exploding.'Sigh...' Taking a deep sharp breath, he calmed himself and unclenched his hands, leaving bloody imprints of his sharp nails on his palms."This damn bitch wanted to claim all my achievements for herself while using me as a scapegoat. If she really thinks I will let that happen without fighting back, then she got another thing coming for her."As long as I get my hands on that slippery rat, I'll let her know I'm no longer just a pawn." His eyes turned extremely malicious and glowed with a tint of crimson, "I need to oversee this entire operation myself. There's no room for messing up!"---A day later, in a lavishly designed hall, a few figures were sitting around a round table. All of them have terrifying murderous auras like beasts.Right in the center of the round table was a hologram of a man wearing a long black windbreaker with a hood, and his face was covered with a faceless mask. It was none other than Jacob."Did you hear in three days there is going to be a competition in the alchemy guild which is held by non-other than our target? Not only that, but there is a rumor going in the alchemy guild that the new guild leader will leave right after this competition." A bull face orc uttered."I heard about the former news. It is confirmed. But how reliable is this rumor?" A demi-human woman with lion-like features questioned with a growl."No one knows the reliability since this rumor just started spreading among the guild members. The source is unknown. But if there is even a vague possibility that it's true, then we can't miss this chance."This guy has been a pain in all of our asses. The secret commission is no longer a commission but has become an order from the higher plain. Now, if we don't kill him, we can't leave this place with the incoming reinforcement from the higher plain." An elf with a deep scar over his right eye coldly uttered in a rageful voice.There were five giants sitting behind the table like small hills, one of these giants, spoke sinisterly in his mountainous voice, "Alright, inform all of our men. If this guy is really going to leave, we can react at a moment's notice. From our new orders, we need to go in full force!"The others nodded their head in agreement as they all looked at the hologram with killing intent in their eyes!

Chapter 274 A Possibility In Dark Noble Circle
Today, the atmosphere of the Alchemy Guild in the inner circle has been quite subtle. All the Grandmaster Rank Alchemists have been missing from their posts and weren't in their research labs either.However, no one seemed to surprise because they had some idea about where they had gone.According to the announcement made three days ago, today was going to be a big event for all the Grandmaster Rank Alchemists, and this event was held by none other than their new tyrannical guild leader.There were also rumors that this was going to be the guild leader's last day, and a new guild leader and vice guild leader will take his place. But it still remained to be seen if this mysterious rumor was true or not.But one thing was sure many people were paying attention to the alchemist guild today.As for the people in question, they were all gathered on the 99th floor of the building where 59 Grandmaster Alchemists were standing in front of their own workstations while facing Jacob standing on the platform right ahead.Jacob was looking at those 59 Grandmaster Alchemists standing in rows, looking at him with excitement, anxiety, perplexion, and such emotions."Alright, today, as promised, I will invigilate all of your ranking tests. You guys might be wondering why I'm taking tests not in your profession-related workshops but in this place."The reason being extremely simple, if I were to invigilate all of your tests one by one, then it would take too much time, and I don't even have knowledge about some of your unique professions."The other alchemists' expressions turned grim as many of them were wondering about this exact same thing after they had time to mull over it.Normally, a Senior Grandmaster level test was conducted by a Senior Grandmaster of the same profession and judged by four others judges. But in their case, the only Senior Grandmaster available was Jacob, and they didn't even know his profession. Still, they were sure that he was the only grandmaster of a single profession since they had no idea about how a reserve alchemist has to be proficient in four different professions.Some of them even thought that Jacob would take them to the common circle branch and have their tests taken by those old alchemists all at once, so they were not worried.However, when they were summoned here and saw the set-up of those workstations which were used to teach novices and then Jacob had them choose one each, they were no longer sure about this anymore.They even think Jacob was messing with them, but no one had the guts to raise their indignation.Jacob didn't care about their reaction as he knew what he was doing, "Alright, before I continue, I want to inquire about the two other tasks I have handed to you guys. First, if any of you found the materials I have requested, then raise your hands."Even information about those materials will be helpful, and I will give ZC for it. But if you know the exact location, just tell me about it, and I will reward you with a permanent member slot. But if you lie, then just know that you can't hide from me."Some of the alchemists' eyes brightened, and some were dimmed while some of them appeared helpless.Jacob saw eight people raise their hands which was quite a good result, in his opinion."You, wolf face, speak first." Jacob declared while looking at the wolf face orc standing in the first row.The orc quickly spoke, "Guild Leader, I didn't manage to get any of the materials, but I do know the information about the Night Salve's location."Jacob coldly said, "Let me guess, it resides in the Western Star Ocean, at two miles depth?"The orc's happy expression wrapped as he dryly nodded, "Y-yes."Jacob snorted coldly, "By the exact location, I mean if a person had them. As for the locations of their inhabited areas, I know as much. I want information about if someone had them already and where to find them. If you guys have information like this idiot, then don't waste my time and lower your hands."The reaming seven people looking excited were started by this new development, and six of their expressions turned hideous as they reluctantly lowered their hands.In the end, the only one whose hand was still in the air was a tone skin gnome."Speak," Jacob asked dismissively.This was quite a letdown when he saw those six were like the orc, and he was no longer as hopeful as before."Replying to Guild Leader, when I was searching for these materials, I got a very interesting piece of news from my friend in the noble circle of the dark city."According to him, there is only a single person in the entire dark city who might have all three materials." His tone to extremely respectful as he spoke."Who might that be?" Jacob's interest was finally piqued.The gnome quickly replied, "It's the Dark City Administrator, the Dark Earl! According to him, the Dark Earl is also a Pill Alchemist, and his rank far surpasses Senior Grandmaster Rank."He owns a pill shop in the noble circle, which only opened once a month. But that shop only sold ten pills refined by the Dark Earl himself, and all those pills were auctioned, not sold like normal. "Furthermore, every dark noble fought for those pills in that auction with everything they had. The auction items can be bought by either ZC or alchemy materials above type-0."Just three months ago, someone had bought a pill with materials, and one of those materials happened to be the five carcasses of Extraordinary-Tier-6 Assassin Parasite Bugs. And this is just a drop in the wealth of Dark Earl's ocean-like wealth, which he had been accumulating for who knows when!"Everyone in the room was looking at the gnome as if he was a monster because none of them had any connection to the noble circle of the dark city since those dark nobles of barren ranks were simply too arrogant.In their eyes, the rank of Lower and Upper Dark Nobles were like commoners, and only those barons or higher rank dark nobles were true nobles.Furthermore, everyone knew just how mysterious the enigmatic Dark Earl was. After hearing this piece of information about him, these lower and upper-rank dark nobles were even more awed by Dark Earl.Even Jacob's eyes contained a hint of astonishment after he heard about this Dark Earl. If this gnome was telling the truth about this shop of Dark Earl, then he might really get everything without searching for those materials himself.Especially the Assassin Parasite Bug, which was the most difficult to find because they only exist in poisonous swamps and not just any poisonous swamps but poisonous swamps with at least an extraordinary tier poison effect.In the entire rare plains, only one poisonous swamp met this requirement, and it was right in the heart of the Wild Nation!

Chapter 275 Magic Gem
Jacob looked at the gnome, who was looking at him anxiously, "Tell me your name and your alchemy professing.""It's Dilly, and I'm a Grandmaster Potion Alchemist," Dilly replied apprehensively.Jacob didn't reply as he suddenly tapped over his wrist, and a projection appeared soon. He opened the guild leader interface, which he received with the badge."I want to send Grandmaster Potion Alchemist Dilly an official member invitation." Jacob coldly spoke, and his words shocked everyone.White Sage's electric voice rang at this moment, "The invitation has been sent, and as long as Grandmaster Potion Alchemist Dilly completes a prerequisite, he will be able to become an official member successfully!"The alchemy guild official member slot was not easy to earn as the alliance or the bank. Without skills, Jacob's invitation would be wasted the moment Dilly failed the prerequisite imposed by the Alchemy Guild.This was also the reason why the alchemist guild had quite a few permanent members in the rare plains. Only invitations like bronze invitations were exempt from any prerequisites."Alright, Dilly, your information is really what I needed it to be. You have earned yourself one permanent member spot, and now it's up to you if you were able to pass the test by the guild or not." Jacob's impassive voice woke everyone from their stupor as they looked at Dilly in unison.Dilly was also standing in a daze as if he was in a dream, and when the Star Watch on his wrist vibrated, he was snapped out of his stupor and quickly opened the mail in front of everyone.They all saw Dilly really received a chance to become a permanent member as long as he completed the prerequisite and he could take this test within one year before this invitation expired."Thank you, Guild Leader!" Dilly quickly bowed in gratitude. He never thought Jacob would really give away a precious slot for a small piece of information.This was also proof that Jacob wasn't lying, and he was a man of his word and really wasn't a selfish prick like Braylon."No, need. You've earned it." Jacob coolly stated, "Now, I'm giving you another chance to earn yourself another invitation which means even if you failed your test once, you could try again."Tell me if your contact can arrange a meeting with Dark Earl or his star ID or at least contact him to deliver my message. Naturally, I won't ask him to do it for free, 5,000 ZC if he can arrange a meeting or give me his star ID and 500 ZC if he can really deliver my message." Jacob declared tonelessly.Jacob knew he needed to get hold of that enigmatic Dark Earl first if he wanted to inquire about the materials. He knew he couldn't enter the noble circle without being a dark baron, which would take too much time. He starts completely the Dark missions.So, using Dilly's contact was the easy way, but it would be quite difficult even if the other party really accepted it. He might outright take his money in the sham of delivering his message and then just pretend to deliver his message.He won't even know if he was telling the truth since afterward, it would be upon the Dark Earl to contact him, not the other way around. Jacob won't be able to blame the other party at all.Still, he was just fishing, and if there wasn't anyway, Jacob didn't mind trying some other method.Everyone looked at Dilly enviously. When Jacob offered him another slot, Dilly was so happy he almost jumped.Still, he suppressed the urge in front of Jacob and quickly replied, "I will make contact with him today and report to you as soon as I get the answer!"Jacob nodded and said, "Alright, it seems I need to stay for more days now."Many alchemists' expressions changed when they heard his words, and it finally dawned upon them. If Jacob wanted to contact Dark Earl, he needed to be in the dark city, so why the hell would he leave and hand over his position before he gets what he wants?Many glanced at Dilly with unkind hidden gazes, but they knew it was now inevitable. If they were in his shoes, they would've done the same."Alright, you guys didn't need to be so disappointed. I'm staying didn't mean I'm going to stay indefinitely. I'll select a guild leader and vice guild leader in this test as promised, and they will hold the command after I'm done with the dark city." Jacob coolly declared as he could easily sense some guys' apprehensive heartbeats.But he couldn't care less about those hidden snakes."Now, on the second task." Jacob changed the topic, which bought joy to many eyes as they were motivated to try their luck. Since Dilly can get a slot, they can as well.Furthermore, the matters of the star ocean couldn't' be confirmed, so Jacob won't have to know about the authority of their information.However, Jacob's next words through those guys from the sky to the shit pool, "Let's forget about the information on Star Ocean, I've acquired what I need, and I'm pretty sure you guys' information won't outmatch mine."So, let's start the test, shall we?" Jacob dismissively declared.Despite wanting to question Jacob's integrity, they knew they would only make him unhappy or even offend him, and they didn't want to do it, especially since this test was more important.Jacob then suddenly took something out of his pocket. It was a small diamond shape white gemstone."You guys should be familiar with this gemstone, am I right?" He questioned.Everyone nodded without hesitation."Still, for the records, I'll explain briefly. This gem in my hand is a 1-Star Magic Gem which contains unrefined Mana equivalent to a 1-Star Mage (Basic Mage)."But to refine one 1-Star Magic Gem, ten 1-Star Magic Cores are required, and most importantly, an alchemist needed to have very keen mastery over their refinement skills."Only Master Rank or above alchemists could refine a Magic Gem of 1-Star Rank, and the method to refine a magic gem is not a secret either since they could be used in numerous weapons or some mages can even absorb the magic powers contained in them to recover their magic power."But as an alchemist, we all know that there is a certain purity level of these magic gems, which showed by their transparency, and we also have a device to measure it. This pure white magic gem in my hand is refined by me, and its purity is 94% percent."However, I can only achieve this much purity on a 1-Star Magic Gem, and as I try to refine a higher rank magic gem, the purity would plummet greatly. And we should all know that an over 90% pure 1-Star magic gem contains more potent mana than a 1% pure 9-star magic gem."So, my test is simple. It is the test of your refinement skills since we all need them at our current levels. Especially at the Senior Grandmaster Rank. If you can refine a 1-Star Magic Gem with over 90% purity, you are qualified to become a Senior Grandmaster."Jacob declared while scanning the dumbfounded crowd. This task was easy but as well as difficult if it wasn't properly done, and it all comes down to their focus and refinement skills.Jacob then stated coldly, "Since it's a ranking test of a Grandmaster Rank Alchemist, you guys will only get one try, and you have 3 hours to complete it. The materials are under our workstations."Don't try anything funny since this test is being recorded by me, and the moment I spot something, I will be free to impose any punishment on you as your invigilator, even torture."His icy cold words sent chills down everyone's spines."Now start!"

Chapter 276 End Of The Test
Three hours passed in a flash, and all those grandmasters were sweating profusely. They could refine a 1-star magic gem within fifteen minutes if it were any other time.However, today, they all took three entire hours to carefully combine the magic cores and then purify them while refining the final product.To refine a high-quality magic gem, it was an essential step to eliminate all the impurities within magic cores, which were mostly collected from magic beasts or some wild races living in the wilderness.Those impurities include the element of a magic core because if the element were left alone, the magic gem would remain the same as a magic core, non-absorbable.Meaning the element mana within a magic core couldn't be absorbed by someone else with another element. Even if someone had the same magic element, the mana they could absorb from a raw magic core is 10% before the magic core would turn into dust, and reaming 90% will go to waste. Furthermore, the mana contained within a raw magic core usually is tyrannical, and it would do more harm than good to recover one mana with it. That's why the Magic Gem was invented.Not only the magic gem's mana was gentle and could absorb by anyone, but it could also be used on a magic weapon as a mana battery, so even those without magic could also use a magic weapon.The biggest benefits were the higher the purity rate, the faster the mana absorption and potency.However, just a 1-star magic gem was sold for 50 million gold coins, and their purity rate is also between 40% to 49% percent (Low Quality). A magic gem with 50% to 70% purity (Mid-Quality) was worth 100 million, while a magic gem over 70% purity rate (High Quality) never sold in the common market, much less a magic gem over 90% purity rate (Flawless Quality) because it was simply too time-consuming.But these flawless quality magic gems were only used as a precious recovery mana source in very grave situations. No one uses a flawless quality mana gem as a power source on their weapon.However, if they all knew that Jacob had been using flawless quality mana gems on magic weapon crafting to create finished products, everyone would go insane from his wastefulness.Because a magic crafter would normally use their own mana to craft a weapon, and those without magic didn't dare to choose this profession because they needed magic gems to complement their lack of mana.Jacob was also doing the same, and he knew he was being too wasteful. But did he care? The answer was no.Because Jacob didn't care about money when he could make more, he only cared about the result he would obtain from spending that money. Furthermore, he has developed a habit of using the finest materials for his research or experiments, especially when he can afford them.Although this habit of his has cost much, even in his past life, he always ends up obtaining far more than he lost. It was the same here. He had become an Elder Grandmaster rank magic smith in 18 months and even developed his own unique insight on the path of a magic smith.It could also be the result of the unique traits he got with cursed immortality, but his own personality played the biggest part in it as well.Right now, Jacob was testing, looking at those alchemists holding magic gems, and with a glance, he could tell just what kind of quality they had. Because he, himself, had spent three whole months to achieve over 95% purity rate in 1-Star magic gems.Although it was only a 1-star magic gem, he knew this gem was far better than any trash quality (less than 40% purity) 9-star magic gem. Even if the mana within them was limited, he could always use more to fulfill the demand for mana."Alright, let's start with the first row, you guys can come one by one, and I'll examine the quality rate of your magic gem. As for who will be the guild leader and vice-guild leader, it's simple, the person with the highest quality rate will be the Guild Leader, and the second person will be the Vice Guild Leader."This way, everyone has a fair chance, and only the best among you will prevail. Now without wasting more time, you, cripple, come." Jacob pointed at the Elf with a missing arm.The Elf was none other than the one who had been brave enough to confront Jacob and then lost his arm.The Elf's face instantly went white and then black when he heard Jacob calling him 'cripple.' If he had more power than Jacob, he might've started fighting him, but now he can only ground his teeth in hatred and move his ass obediently.Jacob didn't even remember the guy's face as, in his eyes, the elves were all the same, good-looking, with pointy ears, long heights, long hair, and arrogant personalities. They mostly resembled humans, like giants and dwarfs.Jacob then took something out from under the table where he was sitting. It was a 10 square inches white flat plate. At its one end, there was a small black rectangle. Everyone knew it was the 'magic purity scale,' used to measure a magic gem's purity rate.Furthermore, the one in Jacob's hand was an advance-type-1 grade, and it was something he got from Braylon's workshop, and now it was Jacob's!Jacob then pressed his finger over the black rectangle, and a mechanical beep rang before a white '00.00%' appeared with that rectangle."Now place it on it. If you have any doubts about the scale, you can use your own. I don't mind." Jacob coolly stated before he leaned back on his long chair, giving the cripple Elf full access to the magic purity scale."I know Guild Leader won't stoop to such a level to scheme against a nobody like me." The Elf stiffly smiled in flattery.With a glance, he knew that the scale was an advance-type-1 grade, and all this thing was getting recorded, so Jacob won't try anything funny on a nobody like him.So, he took a deep breath and placed the diamond shape white gemstone on the scale's smooth surface.'Beep…'Everyone was scrutinizing him while the Elf was holding his breath, and when he saw the number change and a new number appeared, he almost fainted.'82.97%'"How is that possible?!" He exclaimed in disbelief."Alright, you failed. Next." Jacob's dismissive voice sent the Elf into an abyss.The Elf found his courage as he knew this kind of chance would only appear once in a blue moon and said with a pale face, "C-can I try it on my scale?"Everyone looked at the Elf disdainfully, and some even gloated at his audacity. He was asking to lose another arm."Go ahead. You have one minute." However, Jacob didn't care about this as he knew these kinds of doubts would appear, so he just let them be.The Elf didn't dare to waste even a second as he quickly took out a 4 inches small red magic purity scale which was only a basic-type-1 grade.Furthermore, when he activated it, only '00%' appeared, unlike '00.00%' on Jacob's scale. He quickly placed his gem on it, and it took ten whole seconds to give the final result, which only made his expression paler.'81%'When he saw the number, he felt like crying, but he knew he might lose another arm if he dared to say anything anymore. So, he listlessly picked up his gem and scale and left the hall.No one felt pity for him since they were too busy worrying about themselves. They never thought grandmasters like them would fail over this simple task. It was simply too humiliating."Alright, next," Jacob speak again.This time, it was a demi-human with fox-like features, and he was covered in sweat, and his hands were trembling when he placed the gem over the scale.'Beep…'His heart skipped a beat with that beep and when he saw the number…'86.08%'"You failed." Jacob coolly stated.Despair filled his heart, but unlike the cripple Elf, he knew how to accept reality, so he bowed toward Jacob and left the hall."Next!"

Chapter 277 The Walking Disaster (1)
It took less than an hour to filter through all the 59 Grandmasters and test their magic gems' purity rate.Now, only 13 alchemists were present in the hall, which makes them the Pass contestants, and they were all ecstatic about their future prospects.Especially the violent scale Kobold named Clayton and a tigress face orc female named Audrey. They were smiling ear to ear as if they had won some huge lottery.Jacob spoke dismissively at this moment, "Alright, I've sent your recordings with your names to the higher-ups. You'll receive your Senior Grandmaster badges within a week, and I've also sent you guys invitations as promised. Now being a permanent member depends on your own skills."Lastly, the next Guild Leader will be Clayton, he had refined a magic gem with a purity rate of 92.69%, and the Vice Guild Leader will be Audrey as her magic gem was 91.93%."I might not be available in the guild for a few days, but I'm not leaving yet. Now you guys are dismissive, and Dilly, you have only a week to give me an answer. I have already added you, so you can contact me any time."Dilly, who was also involved in the group and managed to pass Jacob's test and manage to receive another invitation, quickly nodded, "I won't disappoint Guild Leader.""Alight, go." Jacob nodded."Thank you, guild leader,"Everyone bowed their head before they left the hall in full of excitement while Jacob remained there sitting on his chair.His lips suddenly curled up, 'I wonder if those rumors of me leaving the dark city today managed to draw all those people out who wanted to kill me, especially those mercenaries.'I was planning to leave right after this test to kill those idiots and then head toward the location of that great earth minor it's in the inner beast forest, which is quite close to my location. Afterward, I would've started searching for the materials and then left the rare plains for good.'But I need to change my plan now. The Dark Earl can save me tremendous time if I somehow manage to contact him. But I'm not going to become a dark baron to meet him since the time required to achieve that title is even more lengthy than finding those materials on my own.'Let's see how it's played out. I can only decide after Dilly gives me his final answer. But it didn't change the fact that I need to get rid of those pests today, and then I should head to the location in the inner beast forest before that guy died.'With that thought in mind, Jacob stood up and walked toward the exit and went all way toward the lift, and headed to the first floor.Jacob then started moving toward the exit of the building and made sure he got noticed by as many people as possible.The moment he exited the building, Jacob instantly felt multiple pairs of eyes land on him.'Well, it was even easier than I was expecting it. Spreading those rumors was the right thing to do after all.' Jacob was satisfied with this development.Jacob then hails a taxi and directly heads toward the exit station, which would lead him to the common circle, and from there, he would leave the dark city from the same gate he had entered.That was the only known entry and exit of the dark city to the common public.--- The moment Jacob entered the taxi and started heading toward the exit station, those pairs of eyes hidden all around the alchemy guild building quickly started sending messages to report about Jacob's movement.Within the Star Mercenary Agency in the Inner Circle of the Dark City.A hobgoblin looked at his wrist, and his lips curled up in a cruel smile, "He's really leaving the dark city. What an idiot. The higher-ups clearly overestimated this guy to tell us to use full force against him. Heh, what a joke."---Within the noble circle of the dark city,Skull No. A-0 was looking at a projection of Skull No. A-1 with somewhat disbelief, "Did that really leave?""Yes, it's completely confirmed; it's 99% our target. He's now already entering the exit station of the inner circle. Those rumors spreading in the inner circle of the alchemy guild might not be baseless after all. As for who spread them, it doesn't matter anymore."I've already contacted the other nines, and they are moving according to the plan as we speak. I'll give you good news in three days." A-1 confidently assured.A peculiar glint flashed past A-0's eyes before he said, "There is something wrong with all this. I want you to send a probe to the alchemy guild building; send two or three if you have to. I want this confirmed Faceless Ancient really left the building, or if this is just a decoy?"If that's really him, then inform me before you take any action. We might not get another chance if we let him escape this time. If he really made a mistake, then let's make it his last.""Understood!" A-1 quickly agreed before the call was disconnected."Why did he leave like those rumors stated he would? There is something fishy about all this situation." A-0 muttered gravely, "If it's a decoy, I have to find the real one, but if it is not, then I need to be extremely careful. This guy is too mysterious and astute unless he's not confident. He won't make a move like this."With a grim look in his eyes, A-0 stood up and walked toward the door.---With Jacob's single move, the entire dark city seemed to come alive as the normally barren exit station of the inner circle started to greet many visitors who wanted to leave the Inner Circle of the Dark City.Not only that, but even the outer dark city experienced the same thing as hundreds of cloaked figures embarked on the exit lifts, which led to the only exit of the dark city.Only if those guys had known they were walking straight toward their funerals, and this would also starts a terrifying storm... alas no one can escape fate!

Chapter 278 The Walking Disaster (2)
(A week before everything went down...)After Ellie disconnected the call with Jacob, her lips curled up as she muttered in disdain, "Although he's ambitious and vigilant, but it also made him predictable. Dad already predicted that he might want something like a route map toward the epic plains or an Epic Rank Magic Evolution Manual, or even knowledge about the rank Epic Alchemist Tiers."In the end, he was just content with maps. I guess a lowborn will remain a lowborn no matter how high they can climb the ladder. Since he wanted to be a dog without a leash, he could be one. I just need him to direct him in a certain direction then."Coldness crept into her eyes as her Star Watch's interface started to before a contact appeared, and then a voice call request was sent, and soon it got connected.A melodious voice with a hint of surprise exclaimed, "Oh? Tell me if it's really my little darling, Ell, or did some Star Hacker manage to hack my Star Watch!"Ellie instantly snapped with a hint of killing intent in her eyes, "Lucy, you bitch, cut the nonsense and tell me if you're interested in making a bet with me or not!"Lucy's playful voice rang again, "Long time no see, Ell. I was just making sure you are the real deal since the Star Hackers are getting out of hand lately as the trial is upon us. As for the bet, if you need money, then just ask. You know I won't reject you even if I have to sell my body for you!"Ellie gritted her teeth in indignation, "Bitch, if you don't want to talk properly, I'll cut the call!""Hehe, how cute. You're just making me more excited. Alright, I'll bite." Lucy giggled without any hint of seriousness. This made Ellie even more rageful, but she didn't lose her calm as she said icily, "I recently discovered that you tried to undermine me regarding the matter of Faceless Ancient."Don't worry, I won't hold it against you, but this matter also involved Faceless Ancient, so it was necessary to mention him. I know you put some kind of commission on him. So, I want to bet on this exact thing since the stage is already set. Do you dare?""Oh? It seemed that Old Pervert finally had his way with you, huh?" Lucy chortled wickedly."Do you believe I'll raise your bank branches in Alchemy Region into the ground if you dare to spout any more nonsense?" Ellie nefariously questioned."Alright, you know we are best friends, and best friends joke all the time. Tell me what you suggest." Lucy coolly changed the subject.Ellie controlled the urge to cut the call and revealed, "I want to bet whether Faceless Ancient could come to Epic Plains alive or not."Lucy remained silent for a moment before her intrigued voice rang again, "Are you betting on; he can?""Yes," Ellie answered without hesitation."I know it won't be so simple with you. So, what will be the conditions?" Lucy questioned."I only have one condition, and that if he is stopped or dies at the hand of any epic level being, or anything epic as a matter of fact or type-2 or above treasures, poisons, mech, this bet will be voided," Ellie answered coldly.Lucy again fell into contemplated silence before she replied with a hint of interest, "You want to void the bet but not place a condition like if I violated this, I will have to give you the item I bet? Don't tell me, if you found yourself losing, you will just go out your way and use this loophole yourself so you could save your own ass?"'This bitch is as sharp as ever.' Ellie narrowed her eyes. She didn't deny it nor admit it and coldly spoke, "I'm placing this condition only because if I didn't place, you would never bet the item I want.""Then you should've tried to ask me. I might've fell for your trap, you know." Lucy mockingly replied."Are you betting or not?" Ellie snapped."I want to add another condition, then. If you accept, then let's talk about what we're betting." Said, Lucy.'Here it's come.' Ellie took a deep breath, "Tell me.""I want to confirm two things first. The first one, this journey will be made by Faceless Ancient alone, right? Second, if he dies in the Star Ocean by some epic-level beast or gets poisoned by a type-2 rank poison or some pirate ship, even some epic stray dog, before stepping on the soil of the epic plains, this bet would be voided, right?" She questioned."To answer your first question, I have already sold him the map of the epic plains' sea routes, but he will not get any help from my side, and I have nothing to do with his actions except that map he bought from me for his services."As for your second question, yes, as long as he won't die by anything but epic or type-2 and with their involvement and can't reach the epic plains, you won. But if you did, you lose." Ellie replied."Heh, giving him a map is akin to giving him a shortcut. But it would make it more interesting. The last question, we are using Zodiac Oath Contract, right?" She asked again."Of course, it goes without saying. Or do you think I would make a bet with a willy bitch like you?" Ellie scoffed."You know that's kind of hurt." Lucy sighed sadly, which was clearly just to tease Ellie more before she said, "Alright, then, then my condition is simple, before this bet, if anyone, this included all the beings in existence, including you and me, so if 'anyone' had made any prior arrangements expect that map part, the bet shall be won by the person who didn't win the bet the moment he Zodiac Oath was established. If you agree to this, then let's talk about the items."Ellie wasn't got flustered by this condition at all. On the contrary, her lips curled slightly, 'The old man was again right!'"Alright, I agree to this condition as well." Ellie agreed without hesitation."Oh? It seemed you didn't sleep with him after all." Lucy's voice contained a rare surprise.Ellie's expression instantly went dark, but before she could curse, Lucy continued, "Then tell me, what are we betting?"Ellie suppressed her murderous urge as she knew it was now a critical point, and she couldn't miss this chance, or she won't get another."You know damn well what I want." Ellie coldly declared."The Scripture of Blank? Alright. But you should know how precious it is, so unless you bring out that Old pervert's Null Space Mirror, I won't bet it." Lucy stated her own condition as if she had expected this much.Ellie, on the other hand, was also expecting this type of demand from Lucy, 'Old man, you better be right about this, or it's not my fault.'After taking a deep, cold breath, she solemnly declared, "Let's seal the deal then!"

Chapter 279 The Walking Disaster (3)
(Present)Nighttime, under the starry sky, between the canyon, around a massive waterfall.The fifty-cubic meter, glistering black block, which was the entrance of the Dark City, revealed an opening on its one side, and a tall hooded figure clad in black walked out.Jacob saw the night sky filled with stars, and down below was the raging water stream from the massive waterfall."Goodbye, Sir Faceless Ancient. The Dark City hopes your stay here was pleasant, and Dark City will always welcome you anytime!" Dark Rose's electric voice rang at this moment."Glad to hear that." Jacob impassively commented with a chuck before he glanced back at the closing door, and an icy smile appeared on his face.Without wasting more time, he walked to the edge of the platform, and without hesitation, he dived into the water stream.Just five minutes passed after Jacob exited the dark city. The small opening appeared again, and this time, there were many figures appearing one after another.Some of them used their star watches before they also dived, and this kind of scene was being played for almost an hour as today many people were leaving the dark city, which hadn't happened for a long time.At this moment, Jacob was calmly running into the dense magic beast forest, slowly making his way toward the inner region. But his speed was only average as he ran between trees.'Just how many people are after my life? Don't tell me the entire mercenary agency was put on the task to kill me? Or are there more hidden enemies that I was unaware of? Well, let them come then. I'll get rid of them in one fell swoop.' Jacob thought maliciously.Although it looked like he wasn't paying attention and was going on his merry way, in truth, Jacob was on full-time high alert. From the moment he exited the canyon, he knew he was being watched.After he entered the forest, those guys who were lying waiting in the forest started following him, and slowly but surely, their numbers started to climb as time went by.Jacob guessed that those guys who were present in the beast forest before he left the dark city were only scouts, and the true force was the guys joining them, and they most likely came from the dark city.But Jacob was still quite astounded when he found that the numbers of his pursuers kept increasing, and not only that, but it was more than one group.He didn't know if those guys were together or knew about each other existence, but he was pretty sure that they all had one common goal, him!If he wanted, he could start acting right away, but he didn't do so because he wanted to see just how many guys were after him and get rid of them all at once.Although this action of his was dangerous and filled with uncertainties, Jacob was quite confident in preserving his life unless there were epic beings present among those guys or they had type-2 treasures, which was nigh impossible in his knowledge!Even if, by some bad luck, any of those possible scenarios came true, Jacob wasn't like twenty months ago. He was as ready as he could get to start the voyage to the epic plains.The Rare Plains were now just like a backyard to him, which he could leave on a whim nobody could stop him.Jacob then thought of something as he thought, 'Cursed Immortality!'Cursed Immortality instantly appeared, hovering in front of him as the pages started to turn and he read words written by Immortika."You finally decided to summon me after two years. I was getting bored out of my mind!" Those words were filled with resentment.But Jacob wasn't the one to fall for them, "If you're doing wailing, then help me find if there is anyone here with a heart worth of Cursed Blood Condensing."Jacob knew it was almost impossible to find another wyvern-like existence in this place again, but this didn't mean he won't find someone with a faint trace of some legendary bloodline.According to Immortika, as long as he eats the heart of someone with legendary potential, his Cursed Blood Condensing would increase. And the bloodline plays the biggest part in having a potential of legendary rank.But it wasn't important to have a true legendary bloodline. That's where descendants came into the picture. Even if someone had a faint trace of their legendary bloodline, they would be considered a descendant of a legendary being.Even if there was a 000.1% bloodline present in that person, Jacob was willing to take their hearts since it was better than nothing. The chances of that blood density getting higher would be increased when he starts his hunt in the epic plains.Right now, he had hundreds of chicks following him, and he could slaughter them as he wished, so he didn't want to waste any potential heart. That's why he summoned Cursed Immortality to identify those hearts.Even if the result turned out to be disappointing, he was also hoping to use it for scouting. But of course, he won't admit that out loud."Hehehe… do you think legendary rank's descendants would play house in a place like…" Immortika suddenly stopped writing, which was quite a surprise to Jacob as it never had happened before.Which made his heart palpitate, "Do you found something?" He asked in disbelief as he instantly became vigilant of his surroundings. He can ignore anything but cursed immortality."Hahahaha…" The very next moment, Immortika's maniacal laughter filled the page, which only made Jacob more uneasy. "Just out with it!" He sternly declared."You really have Devil's Luck! There are two hidden existences within your pursuers who matched the requirement for Cursed Blood Condensing. Although they are not direct descendants, but they are only far from six generations!"Jacob's eyes shimmered intensely as he felt more at ease since it wasn't some danger, "It's quite rare that I'm glad that I summoned you. So, where are they!?"

Chapter 280 The Walking Disaster (4)
"…where are they?""Hehehe… confident, aren't we? But I guess you are qualified to be confident in the rare plains now. Do you want to take action now or before you end this game of yours?" Immortika didn't answer but questioned instead.Jacob answered without hesitation, "No, I'll take them out as soon as possible. They might run away if they witness my prowess. So, just tell me, I'll deal with them first before getting rid of these jokers. Completing the Cursed Blood Condensing is more important than anything!""Alright, you better put on a good show for me. I'll guide you to their locations as they are too well hidden. Only if you accelerate your heart at 15X will you be able to find them." Immortika revealed a terrifying fact that made Jacob feel alarmed.'How could a descent of a legendary being would be so easy to hunt?' Jacob thought as he no longer dared to take the Cursed Blood Condensing lightly. He was basically dealing with high-caliber monsters like the infant wyvern.At this moment, Jacob's figure, which was under every watchful eye's vision, suddenly vanished!"Where did he go?" A black-clad figure jumping between trees without making any sounds exclaimed."Target is out of sight!"These kinds of exclaims started to flow around the forest as all the people started to search madly for Jacob, creating a chaotic situation.While Jacob was now moving like lightning in the west direction without making any sounds, he was so fast even those tier-6 Extraordinary couldn't see his shadow anymore.Jacob took full advantage of the darkness and his superior physique to charge in the direction that Immortika was leading him. He didn't want to make his targets run and finished them off in one fell swoop.Two hundred meters away from Jacob, two figures were standing on top of some kind of small round discs as they hovered ten meters apart from each other above the forest. But for some reason, they were invisible in hindsight.Furthermore, they were both holding two cubes in their hands, and they were both showing the exact place where Jacob had vanished a few moments ago on the cubes' black surface, like a live video feed.Moreover, these figures were wearing tight white robes, and there was black hourglass embroidered over their chests while their entire heads were tightly wrapped under black gauze. Even their eyes were not visible.Under the dim moonlight, they looked like creepy mummified ghosts.Suddenly, they turned their heads toward each other as eerie silence remained between them while they kept their head in each other direction.Jacob appeared only twenty meters away from them behind a tree and looked at Immortika with uncertainty, "Why did you tell me to stop?""Because those two are standing ten meters above the sky wearing white robes like clowns. Can't you see them from here?" Immortika wrote.Jacob was bewildered as he looked at the sky and even made a turnaround, but he didn't see a thing and frowned, "What are you talking about? There's nothing there.""Oh? Hahahaha… it seemed they were using some kind of magic or a magic item to hide from the naked eye!""No, even if they are hiding, I should've heard their heart rate or breathing at least, but there is nothing, especially if they are between the range of hundred meters. Unless they are dark beings, I'm confident that no living being in the rare plains could hide in my hindsight." Jacob retorted."That's where you're wrong. There are myriad ways to hide one's breathing and heart rate, like the Dark Beings. Furthermore, you have yet to come in contact with true magic."The magic in type-1 plains is simply too crude. They don't even have proper magic scriptures to cultivate it. So, you naturally underestimate the use of magic. Anyhow, you will be able to detect them as long as you use your fluid acceleration at 15X." Jacob wasn't flustered by Immortika's words as he knew it was right about the people of rare plains being crude when it came to using magic. Although he had yet to read the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual fully, he had already read the introduction, and he knew it was a basic magic scripture of basic elements.He was putting it on hold because he didn't have time to waste because of Ellie's deadline. But now, he didn't have to worry about time, so he might as well be done with it after making this trip."So, in roundabout ways, you mean to tell me that those two probably have access to magic scriptures. I won't be surprised if they are some high-ranking members of the killer skull society or some high-ranking member of the bank." Jacob coldly stated as his heart rate suddenly started to increase at a terrifying speed.When his heart rate crossed the 10X threshold, faint smoke started to rise from Jacob's person as his senses started to enhance. Even his vision became so clear in the night as he was looking at everything in plain daylight.His hearing also increased as it rang, instantly breaking the 1-mile radius barrier, and now he could hear all those people who were now searching for him high and low even their heartbeats and bloodstream were clear as day. Not even those tiny crawling insects were hidden from his hearing.However, to his surprise, he still didn't find those two-standing right above the sky, according to Immortika. Jacob's fluid acceleration with his epic body was not like what it used to be when he merely had a rare rank physique.He knew his strength too well. If he wasn't wrong, then with every 5X acceleration, he could fight a higher tier being than him without breaking a sweat, not to mention his senses were even stronger than some epic being who didn't have connate high physique senses.So, Immortika probably wasn't joking when it said he could not find them without using 15X acceleration because once he enters that state, he can hear and see the invisible electromagnetic waves in the human eye!
