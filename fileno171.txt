Chapter 171 Motives & Assumption
﻿Inside the military jeep, Douglas and Nathanael had hideous expressions on their faces, as if someone had killed their parents."What now?" Nathanael spoke coldly. He was infuriated by Nixon's sharp words, but alas, he wasn't his match, nor could he afford to provoke the Nightmare Knight Legion.Douglas's eyes flashed with killing intent, "Let's visit the Magistrate. This matter was out of our hands the moment that guy's talent as a Blanker became apparent. And that Nixon is going too far just because he's a Knight Commander. He thinks he owns this place!"Nathanael sighed ruefully, "Who would've thought another blanker would appear in a century, and we let it slip because of our own foolishness!"Douglas sneered, "Hmph, it's too late to regret. But since that guy dared to jump ship, we must make sure he regretted it. He couldn't live in the safety of Nightmare Knight Legion's building."Let's spread the news about him being a blanker to all over the freedom plains. I'm pretty sure those arrogant clans won't take it sitting and try to rope him in or try to eliminate him if he was a threat to their position!"Nathanael frowned, "Won't we provoke Nixon?""So, what? We'll be in the safety of our country, and the legion will not side with him since he had no proof that it was us who did it." A ruthless glint flashed past Douglas's eyes, "Don't forget the legion is not as united as it looked, and they might take that guy as an eyesore and try to eliminate him before he could even mature." Nathanael's lips suddenly curled up, "You're even more vicious than me, secretary!""No one can provoke the dignity of our country and then get away with it!" Douglas coldly scoffed!---Nixon, who was standing in a small white space, was facing a blurry projection at this moment. He came here right after Jacob left.Nixon's arrogant and cold expression was nowhere to be found as he stood respectfully while facing this projection."A Blanker, you say? What is his kind?" A husky voice sounded from the projection.He replied respectfully, "He's unknown in Rare Plains Database.""Unknow?" A hint of surprise appeared in this husky voice, "Alright, send him here. I'll find a way to help him awake a rare element."Nixon frowned as he said, "I don't think it would be a good idea to give him everything so easily. This way, he won't be grateful and won't know our kindness.""Hmm? So, he's like that deviant prick from the Alchemy Guild?" The husky voice sneered coldly."It's still unclear, but we couldn't be too careful after what happened with the Alchemy Guild. I also think he's worth nurturing, but we have to be absolutely sure we make the final decision. He's too careful."A wily glint flashed past Nixon's eyes as he continued. "That's why I let those two dogs of the country go so they could spread this news about a blanker appearing in our legion, and he's a permanent member. Although others might not know what a permanent member is but the permanent members know what it means!""Hahahaha… you wanted him to experience the harshness of the four powers as well as the suppression of those permeant members before giving him a helping hand like a savior." The husky voice laughed in satisfaction."Excellent, Nixon. You're indeed good at manipulating people. Alright, do as you see fit and contact me as soon as the time is ripe. But don't let him die, or someone else snatched him from us, or I'll blame you.""Please rest assured, he's too important for me to let him die or get poached by someone else. I'm sure he might not even dare to leave once he learned about the terror of Wild Nation, much less join other knights!" Nixon smiled slyly as he reinsured the other party.It was as if everything was under his control!---Jacob entered the training room at this moment, the fifth room on the left wall.The moment he entered, a spacious hall appeared in his view, and many advanced training pieces of equipment were arranged, some of which he had never seen before. There was also a training ring in the center.But Jacob wasn't in the mood to admire this place because he was more concerned about the message he received from the zodiac warrior alliance.Although Nixon had given him some idea about the whole situation, he still wanted to be completely sure.Furthermore, he had displeased the Golden Swords Country, which would not end well for him.Although Nixon told him not to tell anyone about him being a permanent member, yet, he invited him in front of those two, so it wasn't hard to guess that he had done it purposely.Nevertheless, Jacob didn't reveal it and pretended he was oblivious to it.He then found the bedroom, sat down, and quickly opened the first message, which was about the rules and regulations of the alliance as well as the ranking system, which was the same as Nixon described it.Furthermore, he also noticed that in the alliance ranking system, there wasn't any information on Fighter Knight or Magic Knight at all.The only information he got was for the Nine Nightmare Warrior Star Ranks, which were specific for the Rare Plains and were the same as the star ranks of the nightmare legion, and there were only names of the rank above, not detailed information.Lastly, he discovered that the Nine Nightmare Warrior Star Ranks weren't divided into fighter and magic. Hence, it became apparent to Jacob at this moment that he was suspecting after he met with Nixon.'So, that guy is hiding his magic potential from the public. I was curious why he was only known for being a fighter knight while he had a 4-star magic core. They might not even know he's an Extraordinary!'So, a permanent member can also hide this fact about their magic power and true strength. I'm pretty sure they couldn't be a permanent member without magic power!'

Chapter 172 The Benefits
﻿Jacob smiled coldly as he opened the second message, which made his hypothesis completely accurate.He was given four identity badges, one for Reserve Zodiac Warrior, which was his real identity. The second one is for the Nightmare Warrior Knight which will be used in the rare plains. The third and fourth were identity badges of both Fighter and Magic Nightmare Knight, and he could even increase their stars to three stars. They were mainly given to him so he could hide the fact of being a permanent member from the public.'Those four powers are pawns in three hegemonies' hands.' Jacob sneered coldly as he installed the badges into his watch, which will be forever installed in his Star Network ID, and he could equip any badge he wanted from his profile.So, he equipped the 1-Star Fighter Knight's Badge, which solved his identity problem for good.In the third message, he received something called the 'Zodiac Credit,' which shocked him again because this Zodiac Credit was the true currency of the Zodiac Plains!Furthermore, his personal bank account had automatically changed into another account called the Type-0 Zodiac Account because he registered with the Zodiac Warrior Alliance directly!Right now, he has 10 Zodiac Credits which he received from the alliance, and he will receive a corresponding reward in ZC as long as he enters a new rank.His golden coins were still there, and he could convert them at any time into ZC, but the conversion rate truly baffled Jacob, which was 1 billion gold coins for 1 ZC. And same goes for ZC to Gold Coins.This also means he was dirt poor in the great zodiac plains and could only smile wryly!As for the true benefits of having a Zodiac Account, he needed to open his bank account application. Which he decided to do later and open the fourth message.In this message was a star network web link, and the moment he opened it, a scanning panel appeared on his watch before a voice started to ring.'Confirmed Life Signal!'Congratulations, the Destiny Star Corporation has approved your Star Network Account!'You have successfully Joined the Private Star Server (Rare Zodiac Warriors)'You have successfully Joined the Private Star Server (Freedom Nightmare Knight Legion)'The Rare Plain Star Network News has been unlocked!'Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he saw that notification after notification.He never expected just by joining the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, he would gain so much, and he didn't even need to do anything or go anywhere.He decided to check them later as well and opened the fifth message.He saw another star network link and opened it without hesitation.This time an application started to get installed in his star watch, and soon, he saw the emblem of the zodiac warrior alliance appearing in his star watch, and he opened it.'Welcome to Zodiac Warrior Alliance Mission Application!'Now corresponding missions according to your rank can be chosen from the star watch application, and a warrior rank can be improved directly through the star watch!'The next moment, Jacob's profile appeared on the application screen.'Zodiac Warrior Alliance ID: Faceless Ancient'Current Rank: 1-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight (Reserve Zodiac Warrior)'Next Rank: 2-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight'Mission'Jacob curiously clicked on the mission section.'Mission'Promotion Mission Available: 3'(NOTE: Complete any one of these missions to promote!)'1.

There was also a new option within his star network right now, 'Star Network News (Rare Plains).But first, he directly opened the Rare Zodiac Warriors Private Star Server, which was exclusive for permanent members in Rare Region.Four further options appeared, Alliance Information Sea (Rare Plains), Alliance Market (Rare Plains), Exchange Market (Rare Plains), and Party Search.It was just like the main network, but the only difference was it was private, and everything here belonged to Zodiac Warrior Alliance.'So, that's what these private servers are about!' Jacob's eyes shimmered in understanding as he finally understood how the accurate information and items were being controlled.He opened the Alliance Information Sea and tried to search for 'Dark Beings,' which was possibly some hated enemy of the alliance and all the living beings, just as Douglass hinted.Unlike Star Information Sea, he only got three results which were all authentic and posted by the alliance, not some random nobody.'Basic Info About Dark Being: 500 Gold Coins'Type of Dark Beings in Rare Plains: 1 UC'Dark Beings Weakness (Rare Plain Vol): 3 UC'Jacob frowned when he saw those exorbitant prices!

Chapter 173 Dark Beings
﻿Jacob never thought the basic info on the Dark Beings was so expensive, and he only had over a billion gold coins and 10 ZC (Zodiac Credit). In the end, Jacob decided to buy Type of Dark Beings in Rare Plains for 1 ZC.Since there was a method to earn ZC by killing Dark Beings, he thought of it as an investment.Thereby, the information file was downloaded onto his star watch, and he opened it to see what made these Dark Beings earn this price and hatred of Zodiac Warrior Alliance.As Jacob read the introduction, he started to frown, and soon after, shock surfaced in his eyes as he read more and more.It turned out that the Dark Beings are the natural enemy of any being with Life Signal because they wanted to devour them!As for what Life Signal was, it was described as an aura of life or the proof that someone is alive and every being had a unique life signal, and a dead creature didn't have a Life Signal.The Dark Beings didn't have a Life Signal either because they weren't alive in the first place; they were like Undead!Although it wasn't described how a Dark Being was born or from where they came, it was made clear that every Dark Being had a natural tendency to devour living beings.Because the more lifeforms they devour, the stronger they become, unlike any normal being, and the stronger species they consume, the stronger they grow.Not only that, but they were intelligent and had their own nation on top of that, and it was called the Wild Nation. It was as large as the four powers combined since no one had ever managed to go deeper into their territory and come back alive.The Wild Nation was also the exact reason the four powers couldn't annex or explore any more territories of the Rare Plains.The Rare Freedom Plains were special because those Dark Beings couldn't step foot into the territory of the Rare Freedom Plains for some strange reason. That's why the level-1 natives didn't know about the Wild Nation, and it was kept a secret not to cause panic.Only by joining the army those natives came in contact with the Dark Beings and know the true terror of Rare Plains.That's also where the three hegemonies came into the picture because, without them, the Rare Freedom Plains would not be able to develop so much and fight with the Wild Nation. That's why they were indispensable.Although the Dark Beings threatened all living beings of the Rare Freedom Plains, they were also good for nurturing warriors, and their bodies had rare resources which fetched a high price in the market.'Wild Nation, the nation of Dark Beings, and there were still Rare Wilderness Plains. This place is simply too big, and freedom plains didn't have the power to explore it.' Jacob frowned as he presumed.This place was simply too dangerous even for someone like him, and these Dark Beings were not something he wanted to trifle with for no good reason.But they were declared the common enemy of every living being, and killing them gave lavish rewards.When the introduction was finished, a picture appeared with information that widened Jacob's eyes slightly.It was a skeleton holding a rusty sword with information on the side.'Skeleton Soldier, Rare-Tier-1, Fighter Category.'One of the most common Dark Beings of Wild Nation. Their intelligence is low; they listen to any order and have simple attack patterns. But killing is most cumbersome because only by crushing their skulls could they truly be killed or will continue to attack even if they had to crawl.''They're really undead!' Jacob exclaimed in his heart. He never thought he would come into contact with the Undead Creatures of all things.He then continued to look, and more skeleton soldiers appeared with different tiers holding weapons and armor.At this moment, Jacob finally sees a new creature. It had withered pale skin with completely white eyeballs and a strange slimy substance coming from its nasty mouth.'Toxic Zombie, Rare-Tier-6 Fighter Category.'One of the deadliest Dark Beings with a body filled with all kinds of toxic components. Just a scratch from a Toxic Zombie is more lethal than any mortal wound, and without an Advance Rare Grade Antidot, the victim will die!'The weakness of a Toxic Zombie is its head; without crushing, it will keep coming back!'Jacob inhaled sharply when he read it, 'Aren't Zombies supposed to turn others into Zombies? But here, they even have an antidote for it? Weill, I guess either they didn't have full information on it, or it's simply because of the species difference, or it might be because of the Advance Rare Grade Antidote.'The items were graded much differently in this place. There was the Common Grade with Basic, Intermediate, and Advance levels and then the Rare Grade with the same three levels.There was also the Extraordinary Grade with the same three levels, but the items of this grade were too precious and expensive.After an hour, Jacob finished reading the Types of Dark Beings in Rare Plains. His expression was solemn as this new information forced him to reevaluate the rare plains again.Truth be told, he never thought there would be undead creatures like Dark Beings in the Rare Plains, and they were too mysterious. What made Jacob frown was why the three hegemonies didn't get rid of them if they were so powerful since they clearly connected with higher plains than the Rare Plains.Either they simply didn't care, or they left those Dark Beings alone to give the rare species pressure and a common enemy to fight against and evolve faster.Because he knew he would do the same if he was far above the rare plains and wanted to nurture powerful fighters.Nevertheless, Jacob was elated because these dark beings also have magic cores of all elements, and he didn't need to offend anyone but the dark beings to collect the magic cores!

Chapter 174 A Familiar ID
﻿Afterward, Jacob searched for the info on those famous fighter manuals of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance.Only a single file appeared, and it was free, so he downloaded it without hesitation and started reading it.Soon realization dawn on Jacob.It turned out that the Fighter Manuals were actually like Martial Arts Manuals, which followed the same principles as inner strength.The Fighter Manuals were divided into Skills, a single set of movements, and then there were complete manuals, which had more than one set of movements.Jacob almost lost interest in Fighter Manuals until he saw that draw his attention.There was another unfamiliar name mentioned after the introduction of Fighter Manuals. It was Combat Techniques.Combat Techniques were unique because they could only be used with Mana, and Mana was something that could only appear after someone learned how to store magic power in one body!Simply put, the Combat Techniques were only for magic users; without magic, they were worthless!Jacob was ecstatic when he saw this, and at the end of this file, he found that Fighter Manuals and Combat Techniques could be bought on Alliance Market with ZC!With great anticipation, Jacob then checked the Alliance Market (Rare Plains) and saw three sections.'Fighter Manuals'Combat Techniques'Combat Weapons'Alchemy'TechnologyHe opened the combat techniques without hesitation, and he frowned when,"Your Star Watch didn't have Mana Detection Function. Because of it, we can't confirm you have Mana. Please buy the latest Star Watch of Magic Series!"'Are you kidding me?' Jacob's face fell the moment he read this message, 'So, if I don't have Mana, then I can't open this shop at all, even if I have this new star watch or not.'Nevertheless, he still opened the technology and saw all kinds of devices like area scanners, mapping devices, trap detectors, and even blueprints sold, which alarmed Jacob because of their terrifying prices.The cheapest of them cost 20 ZC!Jacob finally discovered the Star Watch, which was like an armguard.'Item: Star Watch Magic Serious Model-MM2'Price: 100ZC'Available: (OUT OF STOCK)'His expression darkened because the price was simply too ridiculous, but it was still out of stock, and this was the most advanced model of Star Watch in Rare Plains.He even found the model he was wearing, which was also priced at 15 ZC and was also out of stock.Jacob finally understands just how precious these advanced models of Star Watches are.If he had known that the alliance application could only run on his star watch model or higher, he would know why these watches were out of stock.Doing missions with star watches and submitting them on the spot was a luxury only those with such star watches could afford, while the poor fellow with old models had to do it in the traditional way.Jacob's eyes instantly shimmered when he thought about something and opened the exchange market. 'So that's how it is!' He coldly sneered when he saw those members had put all kinds of stuff on sale, including the Star Watches.There was even a magic series, Star Watch.'Item: Star Watch Magic Serious Model-MM0'Price: 500 ZC'Seller: Mighty-Long'Description: Contact me if interested. The price is negotiable.''What a profiter!' Jacob instantly cursed since this model's price was originally at 85 ZC in the Alliance Market, but here this guy was selling it at 500 ZC!He saw more exchange items, and something drew his attention.'Item: 1-Star Initial Water Element Magic Core'Total Items: 21'Price: 1 ZC for Each'Seller: Brawler94434'Description: Contact if interested. The price is not negotiable.'Jacob's eyes shimmered in ecstasy when he saw this, and as he scrolled more, he saw even 3-Star and 4-Star Magic Cores for sale, but their prices were ridiculous, and most of these magic cores were of either Water or Earth elements.There were still some Fire Element and Wind Element Magic Cores, but their prices were doubted than the Water or Earth Element Magic Cores.Nevertheless, Jacob was glad that he joined the alliance since he could now buy almost anything available in the Rare Freedom Plains.Party Search was for those who wanted to form a team for a collective mission or hire some helpers to complete the mission, which wasn't Jacob's cup of tea.Lastly, he saw the other functions, which were quite what they were, just like their names; weapons sections had all kinds of cold and projectile weapons, and most of them were out of stock.But he won't be going to buy them because those weapons were not worth spending his ZC on. The Alchemy Section was filled with potions, pills, and alchemy herbs.But their prices were also quite high, so he closed it after a look.He then opened the Freedom Nightmare Knight Legion Private Star Server, which had the same sections. Still, it was more liver than the Rare Zodiac Warriors Star Server because every person here was a branch member and belonged to four powers.Furthermore, the things in this server were not as eye-catching as in the Rare Zodiac Warriors Server, but the Exchange Market was booming, and all kinds of things were on sale.But the currency used in this server was also the common currency of the rare plains. There was no ZC anywhere, which also made it clear that only the permeant members could come in contact with ZC after their Bank Accounts changed into Zodiac Accounts.Last but not least, the Star Network News of Rare Plains was more like a social media platform where all kinds of posts and people could comment on them and like them to make them trending.The top post on the platform was by some ID named Cloud-of-Public.'Cloud-of-Public: The Light Nation's Decade Tournament of Glory is about to start in 6 six months. Here are the top ten places rewards! ...'However, Jacob's eyes narrowed when he saw the second trending news by the ID named Important Grace34!
62c5b2942708fd12a9ad975e


Chapter 175 Famous In Rare Freedom Plains
﻿When he saw the familiar name, Jacob's eyes turned cold because if the Star Network ID could not be repeated, then this was the same Important Grace34 he got messages from when he was in the uncommon region after he killed the Earth Slayers and his team.He looked at the news,'Important Grace34: The Golden Swords Country is slaughtering innocent people by calling them the 'Spam of Killer Skull Society!' It is simply unprecedented and unforgivable. They are trying to suppress the masses just because they're voicing out their plights.'The Golden Swords Country had done this all the time, yet they're still blaming Killer Skull Society just because we're trying to change the world for a better place?!'My fellow visionaries, please join our cause and tell those power-hungry wolves that we are not a slab of meat they could cook and eat anytime they want. We are not slaves. We have our own rights.'Contact 'Justice-Skull23229' to join our noble cause and make this world a better place where will be only true freedom, not a dictatorship!'Jacob nearly laughed out loud in mockery when he read the post. He finally understood why Milan was so frustrated about the Killer Skull Society. They could really use the Star Network without being worried about the consequences.Furthermore, they were quite famous and well-received as well since this post was just posted this morning and already received millions of likes and comments.'They're more active in the Rare Plains than the Common Plains because of the Star Network. I wonder how they react once they know I'm in the rare plains. Only the killer skull society knows that I'm from the common plains.'If they spread the news in the Rare Plains, I don't know how these people will take it. So, I have to be prepared. Although I'm not a permanent member, I didn't mean I'm totally safe, and the golden swords country is also not pleased with me.' Jacob mulled with a stern look.'I can do almost everything with the star watch and earn and buy anything even if I didn't report it in the main branch. Which meant I didn't need to stay here under the surveillance of that poisonous snake guy. But I couldn't make it too obvious.' A dark glint flashed past Jacob's eyes as his lips curled up.Since he already got what he needed, he didn't need to act much longer, and he also wanted to start collecting the magic cores, so staying in the Golden Swords Country was meaningless.As for magic potential, he knew he wasn't a Blanker, according to Immortika, but everyone thought otherwise. He believed Immortika more, so he had to get away before Nixon came to him and talked about helping him with a rare element awakening.He had guessed this much that Nixon wanted to help him awaken some rare element, and although he didn't say it, he would make a move when the time was right.As for practicing in their fighter manuals, he didn't need them for now since he was already proficient in many fighting styles. What he needed was to grow stronger and find a way to awaken his magic talent.But to his dismay, there wasn't any information on the first three stages of magic awakening, neither was there any information on how the element core was formed even on the alliance database. All he got was some basic information that he already knew. But he got something like the Magic Spell Introduction, but its price was 100 ZC, so he could only wait to acquire it later and bookmark it.Jacob took a deep breath and finally closed the star watch after he sorted out everything he needed and bookmarked many things he was planning to buy.So, he started meditating and concentrating on his fluid acceleration again, this was his biggest trump card, and he wanted to control it fully.As for the training facility, he wasn't going to use it, afraid to be monitored by Nixon, and he also didn't have anything to practice except the Fluid Acceleration!---Just like that, a week passed, and the news started to spread that a permanent member had appeared in Easter City's Nightmare Knight Legion's branch and was also a foreigner.Furthermore, this foreigner was a banker who was poached from the Golden Swords Country!Some random fellow even posted this news and somehow reached the top ten, drawing everyone's attention.Many clans were interested in this blanker because it was the second blanker that appeared in the rare freedom plains.Somewhere in the Light Nation,Inside, a spacious lab filled with equipment, glass cells, and even a small herb field was present, making the air quite refreshing.A person in a lab coat with 5.2 height was looking at the silver armguard, which had a hologram display above it. It was the latest magic series star watch!This person had a deep frown on his beastly face as he looked at the news about Jacob."Faceless Ancient, heh?" He sneered with disdain when he saw the name of this mysterious blanker before closely the star watch as if he had lost interest.He moved toward a glass cell where a naked figure was floating within a golden liquid and pressed a button before the liquid started to sink. The figure inside suddenly opened its black eyes, which were exempt from any emotions!The person in the lab coat coldly uttered in a commanding tone, "I want you to bring me my new test subject!"---Unknown place,Inside a dim room,A masked person looked at the news about Jacob on a hologram display above his covered wrist. When he read the name 'Faceless Ancient, his beastly eyes shimmered with killing intent.'"So, you've come to your death, huh? Let me see where you can hide in my domain and if you dare to run rampant!" His voice was filled with killing intent!However, at this moment, the hologram display changed, making the masked person's eyes narrow."Receive Call."He uttered before an extremely panicked voice filled with trepidation rang from the star watch,"S-Sir, Lord F-Fire Fiend's group has been… annihilated a-and the Dark Cities has issued… Dark Extermination Order on Killer Skull Society Member just now!"

Chapter 176 Leaving The Building
﻿A month passed after Jacob joined the Nightmare Knight Legion as a Reserve Zodiac Warrior.This past month, Jacob never left his training room except for food, and anyone who tried to approach him would go back disappointed because of his cold attitude.News about him being a blanker was already known by almost every member of the present in the building.But Jacob remained unaffected, as if he didn't care about his fame.Even toward the other members on the 100th floor, Jacob is indifferent, and when two of them try to visit him, they return without getting any response from Jacob, which makes them dissatisfied with this rookie.After all, any member on the 100th floor would have their own pride. However, they wanted him to join their team since Jacob had a bright future if he awakened some rare element, but he was simply too arrogant in their eyes.Even Nixon, who was secretly keeping an eye on Jacob, didn't expect Jacob to remain in his training room without even showing any kind of reaction.He was pretty confident that after Jacob saw the missions on his star watch, he would research Dark Being and come running to him for help, but nothing happened.Nixon started to doubt Jacob's mindset or even suspect he didn't know how to use Star Watch properly, but he didn't show it and waited patiently.Because sooner or later, Jacob will start to feel the need for money once he spends all his credit and will join some hunting party.As for going after Dark Beings straight, Nixon didn't even consider it because it was simply too suicide to hunt dark beings in the wild nation.Even those extraordinary veterans didn't dare to venture into Wild Nation without a good reason, much less Jacob, who was new to Rare Plains.However, today, Jacob left his room dressed in black clothes with a mask on his face. Only his emotionless eyes were visible. But he didn't go toward the dining hall but knocked on the door of Nixon's office.Nixon, who was busy performing a set of strange movements, suddenly stopped hearing this unusual knock.He pressed on his star watch, and Jacob appeared standing outside. His snake eyes glowed when he saw this, and he quickly headed toward the main office."Enter."After standing for a while, Jacob heard Nixon's voice and entered the office.He saw Nixon, dressed in a tracksuit sitting on his chair with a warm smile.Jacob impassively said, without giving Nixon a chance to speak, "I'm leaving for Deep Swamp outside the Easter City."Nixon didn't look shocked since he had expected this much. No one can live idle once they know the benefits of the alliance, and they will eventually start hunting for ZC or Gold Coins.The rewards were simply too lavish for anyone to ignore, and he thought Jacob was the same."Do you want me to arrange a party for you?" asked Nixon coolly."No need, I'm going alone, and I also wanted to see the bustling of the Easter City and want to buy some equipment for myself. I'll be back in two or three months." Jacob stated.Nixon didn't reject him and nodded, "It's a good idea. I was just wondering if you're eccentric. Go, and if you want weapons and gear check, our personal warehouse, you won't be disappointed, and the weapons here are far better than anywhere in the Easter City. Of course, it will still depend on your wealth.'He chuckled jokingly before he continued, "Just be aware of the City Magistrate. He's a petty fellow and might be looking for a way to get back at me after I teach those two idiots a lesson."And also, if you want to raise your rank, just tell me I'll arrange a knight suitable for you but don't expect any cheating or easy way out of it."Although the recording will go back for an inspection, they won't be fooled if they find any tempering, and trust me; it's impossible to fool those inspectors. Many tried but were caught and then paid a painful price." He reminded Jacob with a hint of fear as if he had experienced it himself.Jacob accepted Nixon's kind intention and nodded, "I'll be careful. I'm just going to earn some money. I know my limit."Nixon's smile widened, "Alright, but just in case, remember my ID, Poison-Jail. If you get into trouble, contact me anytime."Jacob impassively said, "I'll keep it in mind."After some small talk, Jacob left Nixon's office and headed toward the elevator.Nixon's smile vanished when Jacob left, and he sent a message from his star watch.'Poison-Jail: Faceless Ancient has left for Deep Swamp. Keep an eye on him.'He instantly received a reply.'Barb0Stone: What kind of eye?''Poison-Jail: Usual.''Barb0Stone: Got it!'Nixon chuckled before he stood up and went back to his practice as if everything was under control.---Jacob left the elevator on the first floor. It was in the middle of the main lobby, and without drawing any attention, he left the building and soon crossed the entrance gates, leaving the headquarter.The Easter City was quite large, and since they already had the concept of gas vehicles, there were, naturally, cabs and trolleybusses for common folks who couldn't afford those vehicles.Even a plain car with 90km/h speed cost over 1 million gold coins, and few could afford them, so the trolleybusses were the best second choice.Jacob reached the bus stop and star waiting for the trolley bus. The others waiting around him looked at him strangely since his get-up was a little out of place.But Jacob pretended as if he didn't see anything, and soon, with everyone, he embarked on the trolley bus and sat down.His destination was west district-22 which was actually the red district of Easter City. He had already remembered the map and all the places of Easter City, so he wasn't ignorant about the city or even the Golden Sword Country anymore!As for why he was going in the red-light district, only he knew…It was morning, so there wasn't any crowd on the trolley bus, and everyone was going toward work, mostly at this time of the day.There was a short goblin sitting a few seats behind Jacob, but unlike others, he glanced at Jacob every now and then, and because Jacob's face was forward, he couldn't notice him.The goblin also had his star watch active as he was in a chat with someone. He glanced at Jacob sneakily again before he quickly started typing a message.'Goblin-King90895432: The target is sitting in the trolley bus, which is going toward the western districts. The final location is still unclear.'He instantly got a reply.'Sneaky2452234: Roger, just don't let him out of sight. We're preparing for Dinner!' 'Goblin-King90895432: Roger!'Half an hour later, the trolley bus stopped a few meters away from the entrance to west district-22, and Jacob exited.Without paying attention, he entered the alleys of West District-22, which were filled with all kinds of prostitutes wearing almost nothing standing in front of hotels, and there were even price tag badges around their necks.The moment Jacob entered, those prostitutes instantly surrounded him like hungry wolves so he could select them.In the end, Jacob chose three tall barbarian prostitutes, which made those rejects start cursing Jacob for being racist, fiend, tasteless, and so on, but they didn't dare to go too far since district-22 also has unspoken rules.Those barbarian girls were beaming and acting seductively while they led him toward their pleasure house.Jacob paid with his star watch to an ugly orc and booked the room for an entire day, which cost him 1000 gold coins, including those three girls' services charges.The sneaky goblin naturally followed Jacob, but he didn't enter the alley, remained hidden in a corner, and quickly reported it.'Goblin-King90895432: He's in West District-22, red alley-07, Pleasure House-98!''Sneaky2452234: Tsk, tsk, which one did he choose?'The goblin frowned when he saw this message but still replied.'Goblin-King90895432: 3 Barbarians.''Sneaky2452234: Oh? What a monster!''Goblin-King90895432: Stop joking around and quickly come here!''Sneaky2452234: Heh, why are you in a hurry? It's not liked those girls will choose you. Even your nose is bigger than your dick!'The goblin's eyes widened when he read this message as veins started to pop up on his bald head, and he ground his teeth in anger and humiliation.While grounding his teeth in hatred, he wrote, 'Goblin-King90895432: YOU'RE DEAD!!!!!!'However, the goblin didn't notice the person with a binocular standing not far away on a building's roof and also looking toward the building where Jacob entered."What a monster!" He mumbled with a hint of respect.Half an hour later, nothing from the ordinary happened as that goblin and the person on the roof continued to observe the pleasure house building.Night descended before three persons, clad in black clothes from head to toe, appeared as they snuck inside the alley-07!

Chapter 177 So Long…
﻿The man on the rooftop noticed those three black figures sneaking into the pleasure house and sneered, "Heh, Magistrate Dogs!" The next instant, he vanished into the darkness.The three figures crept toward the ugly orc, the owner of this pleasure house, and lazily sat behind the counter as business was relatively slow today.At this moment, an icy voice whispered in his ear, "If you don't want to die, then cooperate!"The ugly orc was instantly spooked when this voice rang beside his ear, but before he could even yelp, a firm hand wrapped around his mouth, and the voice sounded again, "You gutter rat, do you want to meet your whore mother so much?!"The ugly orc's heart palpitated. He knew the other party was ridiculously strong because he was a Rare Tier-5 fighter, but the other party quickly suppressed him. He didn't dare to play any trick and stop struggling."Heh, good whore son!" the cold voice sneered again before it loosened his grip and questioned, "Now, tell me, where is the guy who picked up three barbarians' whores this noon?"The ugly orc didn't dare to hide and quickly answered while sweating profusely, "T-Third Floor, Room-3-43!""Good, now be a good chode and pretend as if nothing happened. Don't make me come back to strangle you with your guts. Do we have an understanding?" The person questioned with a hint of killing intent.The ugly orc nearly cried and nodded like crazy. He didn't lose his mind to offend this foul-mouth bastard!Furthermore, the ugly orc was in the pleasure business for almost his whole life, and he knew just not anyone could play a gangster in Easter City. As a result, the crime rate was practically nonexistent unless someone wanted the wrath of the city magistrate and had the army on their tail.So, this mysterious attacker wasn't simple, and he was doing it because he was confident in getting away or had some backer.Whichever the case was, he didn't want anything having to do with it.The next moment, the ugly orc felt the presence behind him vanish, and when he turned around, no one was there, and his heart turned cold, 'Just who is that shithole to draw this kind of person?' He grimaced but didn't dare to say anything and sat down as if nothing had happened.The three black persons moved to the third floor without making any noise."No.2, and No.3, the target has Tier-7 or Tier-8 fighter level strength, so we can't give him a chance to resist. We'll be using Sleeping Beauty and complete this mission of immobilizing the target and getting us out of here without much fuss!" The person in the front sternly spoke in a whispering voice that only the two behind him could be heard.The corridor was dimly lit in red light. Creepy silence enshrouded the place as if no one was there.However, as they get close o Room 3-43, No.3 suddenly speaks, "No.1, I smell blood!""Where?" No.1 questioned with a hint of trepidation."I think it's coming from the target's room!" No.3 spoke with uncertainty.But his companions were not so uncertain because they knew No.3's ability to smell was top-notch in Easter City, and that's why he was joining them in this mission."Plan D, we're going in for dinner!" No.1 spoke in a grave voice as he drew a purple dagger, and a black light barrier enveloped him.The other two also activated their shield barriers and drew their weapons.No.1 reached Room 3-43 and his brown eyes narrowed when he saw a small slit on the door, "It is open!" His revealed with trepidation.After inhaling a deep breath, "Ready!" He pushed the door!A disgusting scene entered their eyes when the door opened, and a vile smell attacked their nose.There was only a bed inside the room, which was currently dyed in blood and gore of two naked prostitutes with large holes in the center of their chests as if a cannonball had passed through them.But the bloody writing on the wall drew those three black figures' attention. "Blanker belonged to Killer Skull Society, So Long Retards!""Bastard, it's them again!" No.1 couldn't help but curse out loud. He wasn't in the least bit affected by the scene in front of him."It seemed the third prostitute was their agent, which would explain her missing corpse. They died approximately six hours ago. But the question is, how did they escape since there is no window in the building?" No.2's crisp voice rang in confusion."How could there be such a coincidence in this world? That guy chose three barbarians, and one of them happened to be a Skull who was after the Banker, and he just fell into her lap? Are you kidding me?" No.3 retorted the whole situation was too fishy."It's the fucking skull society anything is possible. It seemed those skulls also had their eye on the Blanker, like us. But they got the jump on us!" No.1 ruefully sighted."You got that right, and now they can also take the blame for your deaths!" An extremely sinister voice rang at this moment from behind them and before they could react.'Pop, pop, pop….'Their heads blasted into bits with the protective barriers in the mix!A tall person in the cloak was standing there with his hammer-like hand clenched in a fist and dripping in red blood as he looked at the scene with rage-filled eyes."Bastard society!" He cursed before he started searching the other rooms and just three rooms in the same lane. He finally found out how they escaped without alerting anything.There was a large hole in the wall opened right behind the building, which was a blind spot for any watcher like him."Fuck, Nixon would go bonkers and blame me for this!" He cursed in indignation as he also took the hole and left. He was going to search the area before reporting this incident to Nixon.But he didn't have much hope because whoever did this was extremely meticulous, and they knew people were watching Jacob.As for Jacob planning this whole thing himself, it still didn't cross their mind because the Killer Skull Society had done this in the past.Jacob also had no reason to escape or orchestrate this whole situation since they were on his side.At least, that's what everyone will think first…---A few miles away from west of the Easter City was the Cold Wilderness which led toward the North Golden Sword Province of the Golden Swords Country.A bonfire illuminated the area, and a man with silver hair and a handsome appearance sat beside the bonfire while chucking down meat from a long leg bone.Other bones were lying beside him, and it was the last piece of whatever he was eating.This person was naturally none other than Jacob!Jacob planned this vanishing act for a whole month after he got his hands on all kinds of information in the private server of Nightmare Knight Legion.He knew if he wanted to let everyone in circles, he needed a scapegoat and who could be a better scapegoat than his favorite enemy, the Killer Skull Society?Those guys' notorious deeds were all over the rare plains news, and Jacob just had to orchestrate one of their notorious deeds.So, he chose the red-light district, which was the perfect place for him to buy enough time for his escape while putting the blame on the killer skull society.Even if someone had a suspicion toward him, so what?They can speculate all they want, but as long as they don't find Jacob or believe Killer Skull Society's words, it will never be clear what happened that day.He already knew being a Blanker was a pretty big deal here. After some research, he found beside him there was only one Blanker alive in the Light Nation.Furthermore, after digging, he found some cases of blanker appearing in the past, but all of them vanished mysteriously, which rubbed Jacob the wrong way.So, he decided to vanish from the eye of the public, which was his true goal, but he had to make it look like it was done by someone else, not him.By doing this, even if he remained active on the star network and did something heinous, others would only suspect Killer Skull Society had planted those brain chips in his head, and now he was their pawn.Being kidnapped by the skulls had its advantages, so Jacob did it without hesitation, and this way, he will be free to do anything as long as he won't get caught by Nixon or Golden Swords Country.This was going to be even more impossible because he was going toward the Wild Nation to start hunting for those Magic Cores and won't return to the territories of the four powers until he had to!

Chapter 178 A Golden Elf
﻿To the far north of the Rare Freedom Plains was the Dark Woodland.This place was called Dark Woodland because it marked the border between Rare Freedom Plains and the Wild Nation, as well as the Rare Wilderness Plains.Because the moment someone crosses the Dark Woodland, they will step out of the safety of Rare Freedom Plains, where Dark Being from the Wild Nation couldn't infiltrate.The four powers had collectively built a thick wall called the Dark Pass, and their army bases were also behind this Dark Pass Wall. Anyone who wanted to leave the Dark Pass could as long as the four powers didn't want them.But returning to the safety of the Dark Pass was another matter entirely.Nevertheless, those brave, adventurous souls still dared to venture into those unknown territories, and some of them were also the people who either didn't want to be restrained by the four power or simply didn't fear death.After all, the plains outside the Rare Freedom Plains were much more extensive and unexplored.At this time, it was already night, but the Golden Swords Dark Pass was lit like the day in arena lights soldiers were patrolling the area, and many huge spotlights were placed on top of army base buildings constructed in the ample space.It was simply a colossal army compound under the jurisdiction of Golden Swords Army and the most heavenly guarded place after the star ocean.Amidst this compound was a vast road that led toward the huge metal gates in the dark pass where many barricades were established.At this moment, a capped figure walked into the spotlight of the compound gate, which was directly linked with the road that led to the rare freedom plains exit."Half! Show your face, or we'll open fire!" A loud voice warned before more spotlights locked on this capped figure.There were two barricades beside these gates, and the soldiers within them pointed their adult rifles at this capped figure."Don't shoot you, idiots!" The capped figure sneered loudly before he removed the cape from his head and revealed his peerless handsome face, especially the long golden hair.Those guard soldiers instantly lowered their weapons, "So, it is, Sir. Elf, please forgive us. We were following the protocol!"Golden Elves had an extremely high status in Golden Swords Country. They were akin to rulers, if put more bluntly.Because the Golden Elves were one of the strongest races proficient in magic and were born with magic talent, even their untalented members had magic talent.So, the Golden Elves had high-ranking military members all over the Golden Swords Country, and only two clans could compare, but they were still lacking in the splendor of this race.Not only that, but the Elves had extinguished appearances, and they easily stood out in the crowd, so impersonating them was almost impossible. The Golden Elves had golden hair, so they were even more easily recognized.Lastly, the Elves were innately arrogant because of their talent and appearance and looked down on every other race, so this Elf's vain words didn't make those soldiers offend.They all knew offending a Golden Elf in the Golden Swords Country was akin to putting on a misery magnet because they were also quite protective of their race!The Golden Elf sneered with disdain before covering his head again and moving toward the guard past.A troll soldier quickly pressed a button, and the steel gates started to open. Two more trolls were standing there to receive this Elf."Sir, please follow us. We'll arrange lodging and dinner for you." One of them said with respect since they knew pleasing an elf was the easiest way to climb the ranks.The Elf, however, had other plans as he coldly commanded, "I want to leave the Dark Pass for training. Arrange it quickly, don't waste my time!"Those soldiers were shocked, "T-This? Please wait. I'll arrange a guard unit for you."They knew just how dangerous the lands outside the dark past were, and an elf leaving alone there was quite a rare sight. They didn't even come here, much less go for training.They all live in the safety of the central province and solemnly come here, but they come with a huge bandwagon and high-ranking members. This Elf was clearly an anomaly, but they still arranged a guard until it was not difficult for an elf."No need. Do you think I'll need you idiots out there to slow me down or drag me to die with you?" The Elf mocked as he suddenly showed his Star Watch, and there was an emblem lit within.When those two guards saw that emblem, their eyes went wide, "T-two-star Nightmare Magic Knight?!"A Two-Star Nightmare Magic Knight was even rarer than a Two-Star Nightmare Fighter Knight, and even the elf race only had a little over a hundred of them.So this guy was clearly of high status within the golden elf clan, so they quickly sprang into action and didn't dare to risk angering him.Soon. an army jeep was arranged, and the Elf sat in the back seat while the troll soldier drove him toward the other side."Tell me, what do you know about the dark city on the other side?" The Elf suddenly questioned.This question caught the troll off guard, but he quickly regained his calm and replied with uncertainty, "I don't know much, Sir. But according to rumors, the Dark City exists somewhere in the Rare Wilderness Plains, but no one has ever confirmed it since the way toward it is simply too dangerous."But the news spread a few years ago that whoever goes to the dark city of the rare plains will never return. Ultimately, this news was declared a prank by some degenerate skull."However, like the Dark City in Rare Freedom Plains, it also existed in the rare plains out there, but those guys are simply too mysterious and never gave in to anyone, not even three hegemonies."The troll sneered with discontent. He was clearly unhappy with the arrogance of the dark city, which didn't give anyone a face.The Elf grunted and didn't speak again, and the troll didn't dare to speak without permission.Thereupon, they reached the end of the road, and when those inspectors saw it was an elf, they didn't even ask for his id scan and let them pass with some words of caution.The troll stopped the jeep in front of a small gate within the massive metal gate.The Elf disembarked the jeep and walked toward the gate, where he heard a deep voice, "Are you sure you want to go alone?""Just open the fucking thing. Why are you all questioning this lord's capabilities?" The Elf coldly stated."Very well, please place your star watch identity badge in front of the scanner." The voice rang again.The Elf put his wrist on the dark screen attached to the wall, and after the scanning was complete, the metal gate suddenly started to make loud clanging sounds before it slid open."We'll await your return." The voice rang again. "Hmph." The Elf snorted before he flashed past the open gate and vanished into the darkness.---In the dark pass army compound, a burly orc was frowning as he looked at the Elf leaving the dark pass.He pressed on his star watch, and suddenly an annoying voice rang, "What is it, Deputy General? It's the middle of the night, don't tell me those pricks are attacking the wall again?""I was just contacting you to inform you about a Golden Elf, probably an Elf Elder, leaving the dark pass just moments ago, alone." The orc plainly stated."What? Did he tell you the reason?" The annoying voice suddenly turned stern."Do you think an Elf Elder will tell me anything?" The orc questioned meaningfully."Ah, that arrogant of those guys. Sigh… since he left on his own accord, it had nothing to do with us. Just keep the recording of it if those elves come to haunt us. That recording will work like a charm." The voice chuckled coldly."My thought exactly. Good night General." The orc cut the connection.But he frowned while mumbling, "Why do I have this feeling that this matter is far from simple?"---On the other side of the Dark Pass, the golden Elf was moving between the trees agilely as the distance between him and the dark pass was increasing.After moving a few miles away from the dark pass, the Elf stopped in front of a small water source hidden between the wild vegetation.The cloak on him magically vanished, revealing his handsome appearance. Suddenly he held his pointy ears, and with a push, those pointy ears detached from his natural human ears.Not only that, but he started to wash his hair, the golden color started to dissipate in water, and the golden hair turned silver; after washing his face, all the makeup on it also came out.His lips curled into a derisive smile as he looked at his reflection on the water's surface.It was none other than Jacob!

Chapter 179 Encountering Dark Beings (1)
﻿Jacob couldn't help but smile derisively because he fooled those soldiers too easily with a Golden Elf disguise.Although he knew the Golden Elf Clan was the dominating clan of the Golden Swords Country, he never thought it had such prestige.He chose to impersonate a golden elf because they look alive humans and most, and he was quite confident in pulling this off after he got those identity badges. But he was still ready if they asked questions, but nothing happened.Jacob's trail of thoughts suddenly halted as his heart palpitated; the fine hair on his back stood in trepidation.Just as he was done with his clearing, the water suddenly rippled before a sharp blade pierced through the water's surface and headed toward Jacob's face!It was too sudden, but Jacob's danger sense wasn't a joke, and the moment he sensed this immense danger, his heart rate suddenly jumped from 1-HBPS to 10-HBPS and entered 1X acceleration!Time seemed to slow down as before the sharp blade pierced through his eyeball, a black ingot appeared right between the edge and his eye!'Clang…'The sound of metal clashing rang in the silent vicinity, and the metal ingot also hit Jacob right in the face, but it was far better than getting pierced by that sword and dying because of his idiocy.Within that moment, Jacob's head hit the ground, but he quickly rolled to the side, ignoring the pain on his face and head. After rolling over a meter away from the attack area, he finally stabilized himself and rose on his feet.A dark red mark could be seen on Jacob's eyes, but he was completely calm as the killing intent surfaced in his eyes, 'I nearly died after leaving that shit hole?!'He was becoming arrogant after pulling the wool over the freedom plains powers, which was a wake-up call for him.But it was still unexpected that someone was hiding under that water source all this time, and Jacob wasn't careless at all, which could only whoever this attacker was he was hiding under that water before Jacob approached the vicinity.Lastly, he didn't hear any heartbeat at all. Even after he entered 1X acceleration, he still couldn't hear anything.Jacob coldly looked at the long blade piercing half into the Basic-Rare Grade Titan Iron ingot he bought, which cost him a small fortune just before coming to the Dark Woodlands, and if that Titan Iron was of common grade, he might really be pierced through that blade!So, the identity of his attacker was probably below Rare-Tier-6. He could tell by the still lingering impact on his face.Or he won't be standing calmly without running."Why don't you come out? It might be suffocating." Jacob icily sneered as two short swords appeared in his hand.But unlike his old blades, these blades' hilts were long, and two extra black bearings were attached to the hilt's ends.However, these swords weren't his old ones, but they were newly forged with basic grade rare titan iron. The old ones were traded so he could borrow a rare-grade smithy to forge these new blades!He can't just come here without any preparation, can he?As if Jacob's taunt worked, the blade suddenly started to rose, and a V-shaped sword guard rose before Jacob finally had a clear look at the hand holding the hilt and his eyes dilated!Because holding the sword hilt was a bone hand, and as it rose, its entire skeleton hand surfaced before a skull appeared with a menacing smile plaster on its skull face. Not only that, but a cold, dim blue light was shimmering within the skull-like lamp, making it look ghostlier.'That explains the lack of breathing and why it could remain hidden under that water. It's a Tier-5 Skeleton Solider.' Jacob instantly recognized the undead in front of him.Although he had already does a throughout research on those dark beings and was ready to take them on, seeing one in person still gave him the chills.These creatures were straight out of someone's nightmares and the pure manifestation of legendry undead. Jacob had never thought he would meet the undead of all creatures in this world.Nevertheless, these undeads were far easy targets than those high-level civilizations because they didn't have the concept of modern weapons or equipment, but they were still not to be trifled with.Because even if these dark beings used cold weapons, they were still dreaded by the four powers because they had unimaginable numbers!Furthermore, these undeads could become strong far more quickly than any living as long as they devour strong life force. Without that special, mysterious protection of the rare freedom plains, there might not be any intelligent species or any living on the rare plains at all!Jacob's sole reason for leaving the safety of Rare Freedom Plains was these Dark Beings had unimaginable numbers of magic users within their ranks, and only they could provide him with all the magic cores he needed.More importantly, these Dark Beings were all in the open, unlike the four powers who like to hide their true strength, and no one would also care about these Dark Beings' death.Besides, just killing them will give Jacob ZC, which was the only way to buy items he needed on the market to hunt Extraordinary Begins! So, it wasn't hard for Jacob to make a choice!The skeleton soldier didn't seem to understand the power gap between it and Jacob. Since its ambush failed, it chose the most direct approach toward… its death!It lunged at Jacob while slashing its long sword down to Jacob's head.Jacob merely sneered before he moved his sword, blocking the long sword. Although the skeleton soldier had over 500 tons of force behind that strike, so what?The next moment, Jacob's second sword turned into a streak of dark lightning before it brushed past the skeleton's skull, and the next moment, it sliced in half.A slight blue flare surfaced when the skull was cut open; it flickers before it diminishes without leaving any trace, and the next moment, the skeleton falls into pieces!

Chapter 180 Encountering Dark Beings (2)
﻿The blue flare within the skull of the Skeleton Solider was known as Dead Flame.Dead Flame was like a life source for any dark being, and to kill any dark being, diminish this Dead Flame was the key.The Dead Flame was quite frail, and as long as it was touched by any weapon or exposed to the air, it would diminish. But it was only the earliest form of Dead Flame because Dead Flame is only found in Dark Being without any magic power.If a Dark Being had awakened magic power, the Dead Flame would be encased on the Magic Core. Unless someone could remove that Magic Core or destroy it, the dark being won't die easily unless they got completely obliterated!As for those Extraordinary Tier Dark Beings, their Dead Flames were even more difficult to sniff out because the higher tier a magic core, the more difficult it was to destroy it. Even if Dark Beings lost their limbs, they could continue to fight as long as the Dead Flame wasn't touched.Some Dark Beings of the Extraordinary Tier couldn't be killed without destroying the magic cores because their Dead Flames could keep them alive and even revive them!That's what truly made the Dark Beings truly terrifying!Jacob coldly looked at the pile of bones and picked up the titan iron ingot.However, his eyes widened slightly before he twisted his body and used rotated his sword, placing it in front of his ribcage.The next moment, something clashed with his sword, and it just saved him a mortal wound, but the impact was so great it sent Jacob flying a few meters away.Jacob quickly used his other sword to maneuver his body in the air and stood on his feet.Jacob looked horrid at his attacker; a long spear blade was hovering over his previous standing position, which was held by another skeleton, but this one was wearing rotten armor.'A Rare Tier-8 Skelton Warrior!' Jacob recognized this armor skeleton since only skeletons with Rare Tier-8 or above could wear armor.Without wasting time, he sprang into action; he twisted his body and… ran!Jacob wasn't a hot-blooded fool who would underestimate his enemy just because he could, especially when the enemy was a skeleton warrior-level Dark Being.Because any skeleton warrior could command hundreds of skeleton soldiers, sometimes a pair or an entire cohort of skeleton warriors working together to hunt their prey could make the number of skeleton soldiers in thousands!That's why it was recommended to flee the moment you saw a skeleton warrior because these guys were simply too dangerous and hard to deal with.'First, that skeleton soldier, and the next one is the skeleton warrior, and I won't be surprised if there is a Skeleton Grand Warrior in his cohort who could command these skeleton warriors. It's an ambush for anyone who exits that wall, and I fell for it!'Jacob's expression went grave as his Acceleration entered 3X, and he jumped into the trees. He wanted to leave this area as soon as possible.Because a Skeleton Grand Warrior was a bonafide Extraordinary Dark Begins, and he couldn't fight them head-on, the gap in strength was just too great. He won't even be able to scratch a Skeleton Grade Warrior's bones, much less extract its core from his seemingly indestructible head!Furthermore, a Skeleton Grand Warrior or any rare skeleton warrior normally had a metal elemental magic core or golden in rare cases, which had no use to Jacob, so risking his life won't bode any benefits.'Creekekee…'A strange bone-clanging sound rang in the area, which made Jacob's heart palpate because this was clearly a single from whoever was in charge of those skeletons, and Skeleton Grand Warrior could only make this kind of sound!'What a damn bad luck to encounter an Extraordinary Dark Being right off the bat!' Jacob cursed under his breath and raised his Acceleration to another level.He could hear sounds coming from all directions, and this number was more than he could handle.So, he entered 4X Acceleration, which was the limit he could control right now, and his speed suddenly exploded as his single leap was a few meters long, and before the ambush could succeed, he was almost out of the danger zone.His speed was a little bit faster than an Extraordinary Tier-1, and those Skeleton Grand Warriors were not proficient in speed but combat.So, Jacob easily leave the ambush vicinity behind!After leaping for five minutes, Jacob controlled his heart rate, and it slowly started to slow down despite Jacob continuing to move. His speed also started to decrease as he sweated profusely.A dry piece of meat appeared in his hand as he ate it, but he didn't stop because he had this feeling that those skeletons might not be the only ambush around the Dark Pass.He wanted to leave the Dark Woodlands, which were quite vast, truth be told.But as long as he left the Dark Woodlands, there won't be many ambushes waiting for him, not as much as in the Dark Woodlands.Because the Dark Woodlands was the region where the dark pass was located, and if anyone from the four powers wanted to venture on this side, they had to cross the Dark Woodlands before they stepped into the territory of Rare Wilderness Plains.The Rare Wilderness Plains were actually just Rare Plains, and Wild Nation or Freedom Plains were just part of the Wilderness.Even those dark begins couldn't conquer the wilderness plains because there were terrifying beasts residing in Rare Wilderness Plains and their numbers weren't any lower than Dark Begins.That's why the Dark Beings mostly paid more attention to those beasts than wasting their time waiting for someone to come out from the Dark Pass, and they can't lay siege there either, like the Wilderness.But still, they couldn't just ignore the easy prey from the freedom plains, so a small portion of their army lay wait in dark woodlands and antagonized anyone who came from the other side of the wall.Jacob had read about the ambushes, but he never thought they were so deadly, and he almost got himself killed within a few minutes after he passed the dark pass.After moving for half an hour, leaving the dark pass miles behind, he decided to take shelter in a large tree crown since the ground was simply too dangerous.Jacob was also a great advantage because those dark beings didn't have a heartbeat or breathing, rendering his powerful hearing useless. It was only helpful when the enemy was on the move.Two hours passed as Jacob was sitting in a meditative position while holding his swords.A few meters away from the tree where Jacob was resetting, the ground was filled with rotten leaves and mud. Anyone would think it was just normal ground.But right at this moment, two white eyeballs suddenly snapped open. If someone saw them, they would think the ground had grown eyes!However, it hasn't seemed the case when the creepy eyeballs suddenly started moving, creeping toward the tree where Jacob was resting.No sound was made as those icy eyeballs moved close to the tree trunk, and shockingly those eyeballs suddenly shifted from the ground to the tree and started creeping toward Jacob! Those eyes were slowly closing the distance between them and Jacob as they shifted from trunk to branches and were only a few feet away from where Jacob was sitting.Suddenly those spooky eyes' speed turned from crawling to speedy, and within a second, they were upon Jacob, and it was at this time a maw filled with rows of vicious razor-sharp teeth heading for Jacob's neck.Jacob's eyes snapped open when the maw was only over feet away from him, but there was no hint of surprise but killing intent instead, mockery even.His hands moved in a cross-motion right where the eyes were, and the next moment, a deep azure slit appeared within the air, and an azure crocodile face emerged, and soon this horrid creature's whole azure snake-like body, which was three-meter-long and two feet thick twisted around the tree branch.It was like the illusion had been broken.The next moment, the azure slit split open as azure blood gushed out as the menacing creature with an open jaw dropped dead in its place, handing like a loose rope.Jacob looked at the dead creature with white eyeballs, 'If I hadn't felt the vibration of the tree branches, this Crock-Snake would've bitten my face off.'Its water mirror illusion was simply too perfect. So, this is a Rare Tier-5 magic beast with 1-Star Water Magic Core!'Jacob couldn't help but reevaluate his opinion of this place again because the danger wasn't just contained to Dark Beings, but the deadly Beasts were also as fatal.Especially the beasts with magic cores, known as Magic Beasts like this one, who had innate magical abilities!
