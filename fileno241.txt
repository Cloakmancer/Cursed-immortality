Chapter 241 Immortika’s Reason (1)
﻿"What changed, you ask? Well, for starters, you have four things that enabled me able to give you this information. The first is that ritual array. The second is that gray cylinder. Third, you have an Epic Body now. And last, the Titan Tears!"Jacob's eyes widened, "You know what's inside that Cylinder as well?""Hehehe… what do you think?" Immortika questioned in relish.Jacob's expression darkened, "I should've guessed sooner. Still, what were you planning when you told me to nurture Brain Hunter without warning about its background? If I'm not wrong, you know the Titan Tears can easily help the Brain Hunter to enter a 1-Star Rank. Don't make me doubt your intentions." His voice was icy cold as he looked at the hovering book with knife-like eyes.He was not a fool who would be happy just because he got some unexpected opportunity out of the blue.The Brain Hunter's background was simply too terrifying, and if he had nurtured it according to Immortika without knowing anything about it. Once it breaks free from his control, it would be akin to nurturing a venomous snake that can kill him thousands of times the moment he lets his guard down.This could be considered a scheme of Immortika to harm him, and just this possibility was enough to make Jacob never trust Cursed Immortality again.Although he knew he needed Cursed Immortality to reach his goal, then he would also be looking for ways to defend himself in case things went south. But it was even more impossible since Immortika could monitor his every single move.That's why Jacob didn't want any misunderstanding between them, and as long as Immortika had a proper explanation, he was willing to listen.Just like the part about he had clear certain conditions for it to speak, and it was convincing. But he still doesn't understand why it wanted him to nurture the Brain Hunter without any proper warning.This stands out like a sore thumb in Jacob's mind, and he won't be at ease unless he gets a satisfactory answer. "Hehe, this attitude of yours will really help you go far, and that's why I like you even more. You can always keep me entertained one way or another, and I don't want my source of entertainment getting all vigilant of every single thing."So, I'll clarify your childish doubts. First, I want to bring the Brain Hunter at 1-Star because it will awaken its racial ability once it develops its 1-Star Core, which is actually the rarest type of magic core in existence, a Growth Type Magic Core!"As for what a growth type magic core is, for starters, a growth type magic core's magic element can evolve into a stronger element each time the user crosses a major magic rank. Like if someone had a Water-type growth magic core, then it could evolve further into Mist, Ice, or even cloud."The Brain Hunter also has a unique magic element because it belonged to the Fantastic Insect Race. It's called Puppet Poison Magic Core which can turn anyone into its puppet, and there's no escape once the poison takes effect."But it still depends on whom the puppet poison is getting used against, and it can also be broken under certain conditions, or this guy would be in the top ten ranking of Fantastic Insects!"Jacob felt his scalp tingle in trepidation when he read about this new information and instantly blurted, "And you still wanted me to nurture it without even telling me all this? Or are you planning to tell me when I turn into its puppet?"He was really indignant about this revelation, and now he was considering if he should continue to listen to Immortika's every suggestion blinding.In reply, "Tsk, tsk, you still have no idea about your body, do you? The Puppet Poison of Star Magic Rank Brain Hunter would never have worked on you at all. As I said, it depends on who it is using that poison on, and there is a certain condition that can break the effect."You have not only poison immunity of the same rank as your physical strength, but after your cursed heart was formed, you also can't be enslaved by some poison or item anymore unless it's three whole ranks stronger than your physique. Even if you're enslaved, once you out-strength the enslavement object, you'll be free again!"Besides, you and I both know you would've never nurtured that little fellow without making sure it's completely under your control."Jacob was flabbergasted by this new information, especially about this immunity."What the hell am I only hearing it now?" Jacob questioned while gritting his teeth.This immunity, especially from enslavement objects, was not a joke because he could escape many deadly situations if he used his wits correctly."Hehehe, told you before, you have achieved four things that enabled me to tell you all this, so I thought this little information about your cursed heart in the mix since it's related to our topic."Just remember your heart is not ordinary anymore, and never put limits on yourself by doubting everything around you. Vigilance is good, but paranoia is sometimes deadly."Jacob inhaled deeply to calm his emotions, and he knew Immortika was right this time. Of late, he really started to doubt everything around him, especially when he knew he was dealing with strong people.He always ends up thinking they were scheming against him just because they are strong. In most cases, he was right, but sometime, he couldn't just believe anything he felt unless he had evidence.Still, it wasn't a flaw he was worried about, and he knew he was far from being paranoid, especially when he knew this world was not lawful and only strong makes law here."So, what was your plan?" He asked with a calm tone.Although half of the doubt related to Immortika has been vanquished, he was not clear about why it wanted him to nurture Brain Hunter without telling him about its background."Hehehe, actually...!"

Chapter 242 Immortika’s Reason (2)
﻿"Hehehe, actually, the Brain Hunter would never have used the puppet poison on you, no matter how many guts it has!" Immortika revealed.Jacob's squinted his eyes in astonishment, "Why is that?""You should already have a general idea of why the Fantastic Insects are so terrifying, but the limitation emplaced are equally terrifying. Despite their fabled status, they have many weaknesses, or this place had already been ruled by the Fantastic Insect Race long ago."The Eclipse Alipes Imhoff is no different. A common rank Brain Hunter has no intelligence as it only follows its instincts. But the chances of it entering the rare rank and then even awakening its unique magic core is almost zero."Because to achieve this rank, it needed to absorb an Epic Rank Being's brain as well as its magic core. But the chance that it was to happen is even less than zero because an Epic Rank Being will sense it coming from miles away. Now, you can easily imagine what kind of limitation I'm talking about."Jacob was really shocked when he heard this ridiculous limitation emplaced on it just to enter rare rank.It was just as Immortika said, even though he had no magic, he could easily sense danger incoming, and his epic-rank senses were ten times higher than those of an extraordinary-rank being.Now, he finally understood why these insects were mostly only myths. The universe was really fair.Immortika continued, "But the Titan Tears can ignore this limitation as to why. I'll leave it to you to find it out. I can't spoil my fun too much."Jacob's expression darkened when he read at this moment.Immortika naturally didn't care about his feeling and continued, "Anyhow, the Eclipse Alipes Imhoff has another limitation when it reaches the Rare Rank and achieves a 1-Star Rank, it will awaken its basic intelligence and some of its inheritance memories. This topic is also for you to research."As for what that limitation is, it is actually related to its first use of Puppet Poison. It's like this, a 1-Star Brain Hunter with never use its puppet poison on any being higher than its rank."If there is even the tiniest bit of chance that the puppet poison will not take effect, it will never use it, even if this means death!"Because if by some chance the puppet poison does not take effect, it will have to be the eternal slave to that person who hasn't gotten affected by the first puppet poison. In layman's terms, the very first puppet poison used by it can turn the Brain Hunter into an eternal puppet of the same person it used it on!"Jacob felt like he was reading something ridiculous and exclaimed, "What kind of fucked up limitation is that? Is that even possible?""Hehehe… what do you think?" Immortika wrote a question jeeringly.Realization dawned upon Jacob at this moment. He finally got what Immortika wanted him to do after Brain Hunter was nurtured to 1-Star Rank. "So, if it had used that puppet poison on me, then it would turn into my slave indefinitely, right? When were you going to reveal it? It might've run away right away or, as you said, chose to die instead." Jacob questioned with uncertainty."Of course, I can't tell even if it ran away because you needed to complete two conditions at that time. First, you have to find a method to completely enslaved the Brain Hunter so it would use its First Puppet Poison on you."Because its natural instincts are too dominating that the moment it senses the existence of any slave item, it will instantly kill itself or any fantastic insect, as a matter of fact."Because no fantastic insects can endure being someone's eternal slave, and the universe will also never allow someone to control them so easily."The second condition was, of course, the fully condensed cursed heart. I was only giving you a chance because you have acquired the Brain Hunter, and if you failed to grasp it, then it was your loss."Besides, I know you would've got over it easily since you let already one escape, and you have no idea about the Brain Hunter's true background. Its death would have little impact on you."Jacob didn't know how to react after understanding the true reason behind Immortika's suggestion at that time.Simply put, Immortika was leaving everything a chance, and no matter how it had played out, he would never get harmed, and the entire matter would've ended with Brain Hunter's mysterious death.Until, of course, when Jacob found out about Fantastic Insects and Brain Hunter being part of them, and lastly, they can be controlled.He would never have had this strong reaction at that time, he might regret its uncanny death, but he will never be able to guess that it was destined to happen.There were simply too many variables and different scenarios, but each of these scenarios led to one final conclusion, Immortika's plan never involved harming him at all.It was all depending on luck.Everything was clear as day. Now, if Jacob still did not believe and thought it was just an excuse, then he was really approaching the level of paranoia."So, this ritual array can really make Brain Hunter go against its natural instincts?" Jacob was now calm, and no longer had any hint of anger in his eyes. He was still reflecting."Well, duh, why do you think I'm wasting time explaining all this?"Jacob inhaled deeply before he nodded and seriously questioned, "What about the cylinder? How did it fit in all this?""Hehehe, I genuinely have no idea just where that Dark Ruins originated from, but it has a terrifying background. First, the information about so many fantastic insects. Then this ritual array can tame them for a very long time and even make them ignore their natural instincts."Lastly, the biggest surprise is that cylinder. You have Devil's luck. Do you know that cylinder is a sealed capsule, which holds the corpse of a Rank 6th Fantastic Insect!"

Chapter 243 Stop Testing Me…
﻿Jacob was gobsmacked by this revelation and had no idea how to react. He never thought that cylinder he wanted to open held a carcass of a fantastic insect. And not just any fantastic insect, but ranked 6th on the top ten list!He couldn't help but ask with a rigged tone, "Y-you just said those top ten insects were just myths. Yet, now?""Hehehe, they are myths but not friction. That's a difference." Immortika wrote amusingly as it liked Jacob's reaction.Jacob inhaled deeply, as it was probably the biggest shock he got after discovering the Brain Hunter's true value and background."What kind of insect is it, and why is it important?" He got right to the main point. He was now too eager to try this ritual array on Brain Hunter and make it completely submit to him.But he knew that carcass should be very important since even Immortika praised it, and this might also be why SAAI was giving him 1 million ZC without any appraisal at all.He couldn't help but scoff silently when he thought about how he nearly got cheated by an AI and his own lack of knowledge. If he had even sold one of these three things in the champion space, then he would really regret it for the rest of his life. "It's called the Illusory Dream Empyrean Dragonfly, and as its name suggests, its abilities are related to Illusion and Dream. I don't know how someone was able to capture it or even find its carcass and then preserve it in that specially-made capsule."As for whether it is important or not, you can decide for yourself. There was a famous theory going around a very, very long time ago, and it sent the whole universe into turmoil."No one knows who spread this theory, but for some reason, it instantly caught the interest of terrifying beings. This theory was related to Fantastic Insects naturally. The theory was quite simple,"Someone presumed that; If a Fantastic Insect within the ranking of 11th to 99th can eat a Fantastic Insect within the ranking of 1st to 10th, it can evolve into an entirely new species of Fantastic Insect! Not only this mutated Fantastic Insect will the ability of both Insects, but also some mutated abilities."As for why this theory draws the attention of mighty figures, it was because of this exact final sentence, 'The new mutated fantastic insect will also break free from the Universal Limitation!'"Jacob's eyes widened and blurted, "Didn't this mean they can grow without any ridiculous restriction on them if they break free from restrictions?""You catch up quickly. But you only guess the half part, the true advantage of this limit break is those insects won't be able to break free from enslavement items or commit suicide."This is exactly the reason why those guys start searching for fantastic insects like mad dogs to confirm this theory. But how could they find the insects in the top ten just because they're looking for them?"In the end, some of them managed to find the insects in 11th to 99th ranking, but the top ten were like ghosts as no one was able to get their hands on one. So, this became a mere idea and was slowly buried within history."However, you unknowingly found both pieces essential to confirm this theory. If those guys found out about it, they would make you their slave just to rub some luck off you. Hahahah…"Jacob's expression sank as he didn't find this joke funny at all. He coldly scoffed, "But this is just a theory, and even if it's true, I won't try it because there are too many uncertainties. The first one is even if mutation went as theorized, the result would be random since there's no proof of someone being successful at it."Let's assume this theory is true, and everything goes as planned, but do you think I would be able to control that newly mutated insect?"His eyes went colder, "Let's be real here, what if that newly mutated insect can break free from Brain Hunter's weakness of first poison? Won't I be the first one it comes after to take revenge?"I know from personal experience that being an experiment subject, a mere slave of someone is not a feeling anyone would enjoy unless they had brain-damaged."Although all this information is truly fascinating and broadened Jacob's horizons. But despite having the capital, he wasn't willing to take that gamble, especially when his life was involved in this gamble.It might be another case; if he was much stronger than his current self, he might be willing to take that gamble since he could've at least preserved his life if things went awry.But he won't gamble with Brain Hunter at all because its abilities to control others are simply too terrifying, and who knows if he can find another Brain Hunter if something happens to this one.He might not even find one in his whole life, so he was willing to wait until he was strong and found another fantastic insect to try this theory. Since he already had the essential ingredient in his hand, he could find the last one if he started looking.Even Decker was able to get its hands-on Brain Hunter, which means these insects exist in low-ranking areas, and he can visit these places anytime."Are you sure? What if that newly mutated insect keeps that limitation since it was already in effect? It's very possible, you know." Immortika tried to tempt him.However, Jacob was firm and sneered, "Stop testing me. I won't do it without absolute proof that it will keep that limitation. Besides, I have this feeling that capsule might be the only thing that keeps that corpse intact for so long, and if I break the seal carelessly, I won't even leave with a single part of that carcass!"Hearing this answer, Immortika suddenly filled the entire page with its wanton 'Haha…' before it wrote."…hahaha… I expect nothing less from my inheritor!"

Chapter 244 An Unexpected Mail
﻿Reading the last line, Jacob snickered in exasperation, "I wonder if you'll choke one day while laughing like this. I'll do anything to watch it happening.""Tsk, tsk, you're so malicious." Immortika wrote."I learn from the best." Jacob retorted while shrugging his shoulder before he said, "So, if you didn't have anything to add, then I would like to start looking for the materials required for this ritual array.""Selfish! Nothing to add, I guess. Oh, except one thing." Jacob squinted his eyes, "What is it?""Well, I forget… ahahahah…"Jacob's expression fell as he closed the annoying book without a second thought. He was too familiar with these little word games of Immortika. He won't be getting anything out of it anymore.After he closed cursed immortality, he looked at the book and the array design again with shining eyes. He stowed away the book after reading the final pages.Although this book was not accurate, the information was still valuable, especially the sketches of those fantastic insects. He won't be able to guess it was the same Brain Hunter if he hadn't seen the sketch, so this book was still quite accurate.He then looked at the array design and read the material requirements attentively.'Blood Insect Enslavement Ritual Array Design and Materials Requirement!'Materials Required for Ink Recipe:'1. Blood Flower (1000 Years Old Minimum/ Advance Type-1)'Quantity: 1'2. White Assassin Parasite Bug's Blood (Extraordinary-Tier-6 Rank)'Quantity: 100 Milliliter'3. Rainbow Star Dust (Advance Type-1)'Quantity: 10 Grams'4. Night Salve's Poison Magic Core (9-Star)'Quantity: 3 Magic Cores'5. Nightmare Lilly (1000 Years Old / Advance Type-1)'Quantity: 1'Recipe Formula: …'Jacob's expression darkened when he saw all those unfamiliar names of the materials that were required to make the ink to draw the ritual array.'Blood Flower? Why is sounds familiar?' Jacob's focus drew on the very first material on the list.Suddenly, he remembered why this name sounded so familiar as his eyes shimmered with disbelief, 'Salvage the Priest with Blood Flower? Don't tell me that blood flower I picked up after clearing that condition and this blood flower is the same?'Jacob flipped his hand, and a crimson flower appeared in his hand as he looked at it with scrutiny. Previously, he had thought that this flower might come in handy somewhere in the dark ruins, but it doesn't.So, it was left within his pendant, and he even wanted to sell it, but then decided against it when he acquired enough ZC, and he first wanted to see what other uses this flower had.Now, the name Blood Flower appeared again, he remembered this flower again, but he was not sure if it was the same Blood Flower mentioned in the recipe. But the chances of them being the same are very high since he acquired them all from the same place.'I should prioritize studying the Universal Magical Materials (Type-1) and Universal Beings [Living & Dead] (Type-1) first so I can figure out where to find these materials. At the same time, I should also try searching for them in the guild's private server market. There is no better place to look for these materials than the Organization, which is an expert in this field.' Jacob decided and put the Blood Flower and the array design away.As for Brain Hunter in his pendant, he had no intention of nurturing it before he collected all the materials for this array and enslaved it fully. He knew he only had one shot at this and so he had to be fully prepared.Lastly, he was still not sure if that poison thing was real or not and if he was really willing to get bitten by a terrifying insect just for a chance to control it while he could do the same with this ritual array.Although he trusted Immortika's words, he was still not willing to follow them blindly. Paranoid or not, when it comes to his life, he will prefer being paranoid then getting careless and putting his life at risk.So, he was going to test that poison immunity by buying poisons from rare rank to extraordinary rank peak as well as some slave items, and only then would he be sure and worry-free.After making his plans, he opened the Universal Magical Materials Encyclopedia and started to study all kinds of materials in it. There were even pictures to boot, so he was quite satisfied with his spending on it, and soon, he was completely immersed.However, two hours later, his focus was broken when his Star Watch suddenly vibrated. He thought it was a message related to his promotion to the Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith Rank, so he didn't pay attention to it and continued to read.However, a minute later, his star watch vibrated again, and this time, an interface popped up right above his virtual book, which startled him. But when he saw the interface was actually the message interface and read the sender's name, his eyes narrowed, and a bad feeling wiled in his heart."Might-Of-Destruction send you a Mail!""Read!""(NOTE: Might-Of-Destruction has used Star Privilege to send an unignorable Mail Request. Might-Of-Destruction Star Privilege is higher than You (Faceless Ancient), Mail can't be ignored or minimized, Star ID can't be blocked!)"'Why now of all the time? Is this prick planning something?' The more Jacob thought, the more he felt it was highly likely.Because he didn't have a good impression of Gunnar since this guy was emitting arrogance with his every single word, and he knew this kind of person was akin to crackheads who could get offended by simple words and thought themselves superior to others.Furthermore, he was still under the impression that Gunnar won't contact him until the time he gave Jacob to reach the official member status was over, and with his pride, Jacob was sure he would do exactly this.But this message smells like trouble.With a grim expression, he read it, and when he saw the single string of words, naked killing intent emitted from his eyes,"Might-Of-Destruction: You are not qualified to be in Zodiac Warrior Alliance!"

Chapter 245 Rich Winter Lady (1)
﻿"Might-Of-Destruction: You are not qualified to be in Zodiac Warrior Alliance!"A thick vein popped up on Jacob's temple as naked killing intent, which could make even an Epic Rank Begin shudder, enveloped the entire apartment. It was a while since Jacob felt a genuine urge to kill someone before torturing them.But for some reason, the anger gradually started to lessen like a breeze before Jacob was tranquil, which was even more terrifying than his angry self.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ He didn't know if this was the effect of his new heart, but now, feeling such as shock, fear, anger, excitement, and such no longer remained for long before he returned to his tranquil state.Whatever the case was, Jacob was quite satisfied with this kind of effect since this lessened the chances of him making rash decisions and keeping his calm all the time.Still, this didn't mean he was not bloody for Gunner anymore. On the contrary, he was going to remember this for as long as he could live.Eventually, he was going to the epic plains, and he would also reach the peak of that plain if everything went smoothly, and when that happened, he'll make sure to personally ask Gunnar if he was qualified or not.Jacob closed the mail and then looked at the previous notification, and just as he expected, this notification was an alert of his being kicked out of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, and his membership and all the benefits with it were revoked, except for his already earned ZC and bank account.His identity badges, the alliance mission application, private servers, everything was now unavailable to him. This only intensified his urge to torture Gunnar even more.In the end, he sighed ruefully and closed the alert notification, and equipped a new identity badge which was the Grandmaster Rank Badge he earned from the guild a few hours ago.'Something is not right with this sudden act of foolishness. If he was holding a grudge, why not kick me out the same day? Or he was just toying with me by giving me false hope before shattering it when I was close to becoming an official member? But he didn't strike me as someone with patience who could hold their anger in.  Well, whatever the case, I just hope he won't die before I seek the answer to this question.'Although getting kicked out of the Alliance was quite a letdown and cutting off his path toward the alliance resources. But he quickly got over it when he thought about how he wasn't even able to get access to magic knowledge in the alliance because he didn't have mana.On the contrary, if he thinks about it more carefully, he can now join the Alchemy Guild since he is no longer a permanent member of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance.Because the guild was filled with all kinds of knowledge about magic and technology, and even the alliance wasn't matched for the guild when it came to knowledge.Although Jacob had killer instincts, he was also a researcher by heart, and this world was filled with wonders and unknowns, which made him equally curious about gaining immortality.Fighting skills and gaining strength was important, but having knowledge was equally important, just like what happened with the Fantastic Insects. If he had known before, he won't be in the dark about Immortika's true intentions.Jacob knew he had the chance to join the Guild since he was the youngest Senior Grandmaster ever to appear in the Rare Plains. Since Nixon could invite him from the freedom plains, he was sure someone in the Dark City would definitely invite him unless they were blind.After concluding that the Alchemy Guild suits him even more than the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, he quickly got over this sudden bad news, and with a hint of anticipation, he again immersed himself in his reading even more seriously.However, he was again disturbed by another unexpected popped-up interface which made him narrow his eyes in scrutiny."Rich Winter Lady wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!""(NOTE: Rich Winter Lady has used Star Privilege to send an unignorable Call Request. Rich Winter Lady Star Privilege is higher than You (Faceless Ancient), Notification can't be ignored, Star ID can't be blocked!)"'Someone with at least 2-Star Privilege contacting me again and right after I got kicked out of the alliance? Interesting.' Jacob's lips curled up in a cold smile as he accepted the call with a blurry black protection setting.He was quite fond of this feature since it could keep his identity secret and also annoy the other party, and reveal prick-like personalities such as Gunnar.The moment he accepted the projection call, a golden blur materialized over his wrist. A melodious voice rang soon after, "Faceless Ancient, on behalf of Universal Zodiac Bank, I, as the Bank Manager, personally invite you to be a Permanent Member!"Jacob was astonished by this woman's direct and straightforward approach as well as the unexpected invitation from the Universal Zodiac Bank, which should be the name of the existence behind the Zodiac Taurus Bank.Furthermore, this woman had the same status as Gunnar, and her timing could be said impeccable because she directly invited him without beating around the bush, which also means she knew he had been kicked out of the alliance and was a permanent member before.As long as Gunnar wasn't bragging about kicking a nobody like Jacob on the star news, then the only possibility was this was some kind of ploy by this woman, or Gunnar was also involved in this.He coldly asked without caring about the other party's identity, "Are you the one behind my membership revocation?"Rich Winter Lady unexpectedly answered without hiding anything, "The Zodiac Warrior Alliance won't deserve a talent like you, nor President Gunnar appreciate your true worth."He sold your revocation for 1 Million ZC. The Alliance is only a place for brutes who only know how to fight or increase their strength at all cost, even if they had to sell their kin for it."Jacob couldn't help but sneer, "You make it sound so dirty. Quite a hypocrite for the one who paid for someone's future like it were a measly item."His voice turned icy cold, "Do you really think just because you paid him to kick me out, I will jump on your lap like some fucking dog? Or do you think of me as a slave which you purchase from some bollocks?"Rich Winter Lady didn't seem to be angry at all. She replied in the same impassive tone, "Mr. Jacob Steve, I think you have some misunderstanding in this matter. I wasn't the one who paid for your membership revocation!"

Chapter 246 Rich Winter Lady (2)
﻿Jacob was stumped momentarily, but it didn't mean he would apologize. Since this woman knows this much, then she was here with motives as well.As for her knowing his actual name, he wasn't surprised in the least bit since he was already registered with his name in Alchemy Guild and the Zodiac Bank in the common plains. So, I didn't come as surprised that they knew his actual name.It mattered a little as long as they didn't know his appearance, and he was pretty sure the Star ID mattered far more than actual names in Zodiac Plains.Then, he replied coolly, "Does it matter? Why would I join the Bank just because Miss Manager contacted me personally? Besides, what's the point of joining three hegemonies when they are unfair to their members, and anyone can use their authority without any consequences."Rich Winter Lady paused for a moment before she spoke impassively, "I understand your point and your stance in this, Mr. Jacob. But you have a false impression of the three hegemonies' power structure."Only the Guild President, Alliance Chairman, or Bank Manager of a Plain can kick branch members or reserve official members. We can't do anything about official members and only punish them if they make mistakes. This kind of authority is in possession of very high-ranking members."Anyhow, I'm sincere in the invitation, and I'm not like Chairman Gunnar, who only knows how to use his fists. You hailed from the Common Plains, and then somehow, you become the Champion of Rare Plains Trial."I have no idea how a native of Rare Plains ends up in the Common Plains, especially someone with your abilities. You're in the Dark City's Alchemy Guild and about to become Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith. This alone makes you highly valuable."As long as you join the Universal Zodiac Bank, you can immediately leave the Rare Plains and come to the Epic Plains, where you truly belong. The Epic Plain Trial will start in a few years, and at that time, we can use someone with your expertise."Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he heard the last part. 'She's probably thinking of me as a native of Rare Plains since I can enter the Rare Plains Trial. But why did she think I could enter the Epic Plains Trial?'Furthermore, how did she know about my current location and that I was about to become a Senior Grandmasters Gunsmith? I must admit this woman's means are far more impressive than that dickhead.' Jacob grimaced as he didn't feel good about this at all."Miss Manager, I can't enter the Epic Plains Trial since I'm the native of Rare Plains. Don't try to trick me." Jacob probed her true intention."Oh, I forgot Mr. Jacob didn't know about the loophole of a Plain Trial. Consider this my piece of goodwill. As you know, once a plain trial is complete, the life zone and death zone become like neutral plain."And I'm sure you already know that a champion can maintain their sides of the zone and other authorities. Without a life zone or death zone, anyone can go anywhere as long as they are within the strength limit of that plains."Then what do you think will happen to those who were settled in that plain after the trial was completed in those hundreds of years? Because the two sides are always at each other throats and many reinforcements come when a trial is complete from both sides so each side won't have an entire Plain for themselves."Only the Common Plains are an expectation. Anyhow, will those newcomers be kicked out of the plains when the cycle ends and another trial plain is formed?" Rich Winter Lady questioned impassively.Jacob squinted his eyes as he didn't think this deeply into this since these restrictions were meaningless to him. However, now that Rich Winter Lady asked this question, he considered it carefully.Suddenly, his eye winded slightly as he said with uncertainty, "Could it be anyone who was staying on the plains during the trial formation will be considered that plain's native and can join the trail as well? Is this the loophole?""As expected of someone who completed a trial in less than six months. As you stated, Mr. Jacob, anyone present in that plain during a new trial forming will be considered a native of that plain." Rich Winter Lady praised, but it was as empty as her voice. She had given all the clues, and if Jacob couldn't even guess after all those clues, she might've already lost interest in him."How many years before the trial starts again?" Jacob dismissively questioned."6 Years and 5 Months. So, what do you think? If you join the Universal Zodiac Bank, I'll arrange a ship for you, and you'll be here in 2 years. Afterward, I can help you increase your blood force to Epic Rank Blood Force. All you need to do is say the word." Rich Winter Lady offered with full of temptation and confidence.If it were anyone else, they would've instantly agreed to her offer. The promise of increasing the blood force to Epic Rank was enough to move them.Alas, it was Jacob who was only interested in things that were useful to him, and the blood force was not a barrier at all. As long as he followed the Cursed Immortality, his blood force will charge up.But he was still somewhat shocked hearing it would take him two years to travel to reach the Epic Plains, and this was time considering he had the help of someone like Rich Winter Lady."Miss Manager, since you're sincere, I won't be unreasonable. Truth be told, I'm not interested in fighting, and I'm more of a researcher. Stumbling into the Dark Ruins was not intentional, nor did joining the Alliance as a permanent member.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "I was quite ignorant then and took some unwanted steps and somehow survived the entire ordeal. Do you know joining the Alchemy Guild was my goal from the start, and Chairman Gunnar gave me a time limit before he would've kicked me out?"So, I was never going to make up to the time limit, and I had no intention of staying in the alliance in the first place. I only told you this because you gave me an important piece of information, and I'm also apologizing for my previous behavior." Jacob 'sincerely' explain.Although it was truth mixed with lies, but did the other party know this?

Chapter 247 Secret Commission!
 ﻿A white marble hall was filled with all kinds of sculptures, and they were all vividly sculpted to the very last details. It was clear the sculptor was the master of its art.Amidst these sculptures, a tall curvaceous figure stood before an unfinished sculpture, but its shape was quite apparent as it looked like a bird spreading its wings.The woman was holding a chisel in her slender hand as she stroked the sculpture gently and gracefully as she carved its feathers. Strangely, there wasn't any sound of her carving at all.On the other hand, a blurry black projection could be seen on his other wrist, and a deep cold voice sounded in this silent hall."… I'm also apologizing for my previous behavior. But I will still join the Alchemy Guild since it suits me more, and I have no intention of entering another trial plan anytime soon."The woman paused for a moment, hearing this unexpected answer, and a hint of dissatisfaction flashed past her enthralling oceanic-blue eyes. But it was only fleeting as tranquility returned, and she moved her hand gracefully.She spoke as her melodious voice rang in the hall, "If Mr. Jacob is interested in research, the Bank can meet your demands as well. The Bank lacks anything but money and trusts me; everything has a price.""I couldn't agree more. But I'm still going to stick with my choice." Jacob's voice rang again, and his answer also remained the same.The Rich Winter Lady finally stopped, and a tiny frown appeared on her peerless face. She looked toward the blurry black projection for the first time after their conversation was started.She looked deeply at the black blur as if she wanted to see the person behind it. She finally spoke, "How about you state your demands, Mr. Jacob?"It was her first seeing someone rejecting her offer, especially when she was offering everything a native of the Rare Plains could dream of. But for some reason, this guy remained dismissive as if nothing could sway him.Not only he dared to scold her at the start, but he also didn't seem to care about her status at all and wasn't polite from start to end.'Did he think since I don't know his face, he can be fearless and talk to me like some third-grade character?' A hint of coldness surfaced in her tranquil eyes as she waited for the answer.Although she wanted to rope in this genius of Rare Plains because of his potential in Gunsmithing, this didn't mean she was desperate. He was, after all, a genius of Rare Plains, not Epic Plains.She just doesn't understand why he was throwing away a golden opportunity. Now she was getting impatient, so she gave her final offer. If he still didn't cherish it, then she won't be bothering with this arrogant bumpkin anymore.Even though she would lose some ZC that she used to buy his information from a broker, she would rather let the alchemy guild have this loss cannon who didn't know good from bad. But it wasn't that simple either."I have no demand Miss Manger. Again, I fully…."Before Jacob could finish, blue light shimmered over her wrist before the projection vanished. She cut the call!She coldly scoffed as blue light shimmered over her wrist again, and another interface appeared with another Star ID, and a message panel was opened. Writing started to appear on the message box on its own.'Issue a Secret Commission to all Reserve Universal Mercenaries in the Rare Plains Dark City to assassinate the new Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith, Faceless Ancient, in the Dark City's Alchemy Branch.'Contact the Informative and tell him to cooperate with Universal Mercenaries fully. Price is not a problem.'After reading the message and finding no mistake, she sent it before the blue light on her wrist stopped shimmering, and she didn't pay any more attention to it either."Little Ellie, don't even think I would let you profit from this so easily." The Rich Winter Lady muttered mockingly before she returned to sculpturing as if nothing had happened.From start to finish, this wasn't about Jacob at all!---Jacob looked at the star watch projection, which no longer had any blurry figure, and sneered, "Well, I save me the trouble of explaining it to her. If this woman thinks I'm an idiot, she was not better than that dickhead."The reason for Jacob's disdain was he noticed some loopholes in Rich Winter Lady's invitation. First, she never mentioned anything about his Bank Account despite her being the Bank Manager.This lets him conclude that she was inviting him to be a mercenary like the Star Mercenary Agency of the Bank, not the actual member who is connected with the Bank.The Mercenary Agency was like the Armed Forces of the Bank, and Jacob wasn't sure what kind of personnel were truly in charge of the bank's management, like the Personal Zodiac Bank Accounts.As to why he thought this way, it was pretty simple, if the Bank Account were considered a universally recognized money wallet, there would be strict rules attached to it for having such a status.If anyone offends a bank member of high authority and then, like Gunnar, that person revoked their bank account on a whim, will anyone dare to use the ZC as currency?Jacob was even sure that even if someone was a heinous criminal, the Bank still needed to go through many troubles to block that person's bank account because of its universal status.The biggest proof of his theory being true was the SAAI making his Bank Account level raised while he was still a member of the Alliance, and it was still the same even after Gunnar kicked him out.So, Jacob was confident that this woman couldn't do anything to his bank account no matter what.Second, she only promised him money, nothing else, and Jacob didn't need money at all right now, and he also couldn't trust someone as cunning as this Rich Winter Lady.She was full of schemes and not readable like Gunnar, so Jacob still liked to stay away from her as long as he wasn't completely confident in handling her schemes.Lastly, he wanted to join the Alchemy Guild because this palace was a huge cover-up to hide his actual strength now that he thinks it through.A high-ranking alliance member will instantly be labeled as a powerful fighter, while the member of the Alchemy Guild will always consider a scholar or researcher first.However, Jacob's thought process was again disturbed by another call!

Chapter 248 Accepting The Offer
﻿"Amiable Monk Fish wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!"However, Jacob's frown lessened when he saw this call wasn't sent by using star privilege. But it was still the fact that this Amiable Monk Fish might be someone with equivalent star privilege as him since she was able to send him a call request.'Don't tell me that woman is trying to play another trick to get me to join the bank?' He thought gloomily.Still, he decided to accept the call since it would be far easier to predict the other party's motives and figure out what her ploy was with this call. He didn't change his blur setting, though.As he accepted the call, he expected another blurry figure, but to his surprise, a veiled woman appeared, sitting behind a desk gracefully.But what drew his attention was her purple smooth skin. Her blue eyebrows were like those of a fox, and those sky-blue cat eyes were filled with fiery vigor and a hint of cunningness. Although she looked like a human, she clearly wasn't.Amiable Monk Fish spoke in her crisp voice, "How about you turn off this annoying blur before I give you the biggest opportunity of your life?"Jacob almost disconnected the call when he heard this and questioned with a frown, "Who are you?"It was the second opportunity he was receiving today, and truth be told, he was exasperated and wanted to stow away his star watch for good."Oh, my mistake." The Amiable Monk Fish seemed to understand her mistake before gracefully introducing herself, "I'm the Vice President of Epic Plains Alchemy Guild, Ellie, and you should be able to guess now why I contacted you, right?"Jacob's eyes widened ever so slightly as he thought about something, "I presumed it was Miss Ellie who was behind my membership revocation from the Alliance?"Now that Jacob thought about it, since this woman contacted him right after the Rich Winter Lady, then this means she also knew about him getting kicked out of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance. She might as well be the actual perpetrator.But the Rich Winter Lady was still more terrifying than her since she could reach him before Ellie could, which shows the difference between the two.Still, he was more restrained toward Ellie after knowing her identity as the Alchemy Guild Vice President. After all, he wanted to join this place, and he didn't want to fall out with the Vice President right off the bat.Ellie didn't flinch as she instantly admitted it and coolly stated, "Of course. I lost 1 million ZC to free you from those brutes. Why aren't you thanking me? And you're still a blur!"Speechless by her answer, he didn't know what to say.'So, she's a self-centered bitch.' He frowned, and after thinking for a moment, he removed the blur, but he was still wearing his hood and mask."I never remember asking Vice President Ellie to pay for my revocation, nor did I say I was unconformable in the alliance. You were taking action on your behest." Jacob coldly replied.Ellie's foxy eyes narrowed when she saw the black-clad masked figure, "Just like I watched in the video recording. You like to hide your face, huh?""I'm too unpleasing to eyes." Jacob impassively replied."Heh, I believe my eyes more. Anyhow, I know I took matters into my hands, which was unprofessional. But I saw your potential, and you are not made for fighting."Even though you would appear unstoppable in Extraordinary Rank. But the Epic Rank is completely different. Because in Epic Rank, you can either choose the Magic path or you can choose the Combatant path. Furthermore, what matters even more is the Bloodline and the type of bloodline."Jacob's interest was finally piqued when he heard this, especially since magic and bloodline come into the picture."Can you elaborate on the last part?" He asked.Ellie's eyes slid up as if she was smiling behind her veil. She said, "I can, as long as you join the Alchemy Guild as a Reserve Alchemist."Jacob didn't answer immediately as he said, "I want to know the perks of Reserve Alchemist?""Everything is the same as the alliance. The only difference is your mission will be more inclined toward alchemy rather than fighting. Instead of Fighter Manual and Combat Techniques, you will have access to 'Alchemy Knowledge,' 'Alchemy Skills,' and 'Alchemy Techniques.'"We pursued only the truth behind everything, and no one dared to come in our way. Even those brutes must be polite to us if they don't want poison instead of medicines. Hmph!" Ellie stated with full of pride and disdain.Even Jacob felt Ellie had a point because the Alchemists were the crafters of weapons and medicines, and they controlled the biggest raw materials chains in any plains.Although the alliance or the bank might be able to provide those things, the knowledge in Alchemy Guild's possession was a top-secret, just like the Fighter and Combat Manuals of the Alliance.They can't be exchanged, and no one will dare to divulge their information to anyone, nor will someone dare to receive this information because if found there was only death awaits for any party involved.Jacob then didn't ask any further as he had already decided to join the Alchemy Guild, and now he was thinking that getting out of the alliance was not bad at all."Alright, I'll accept your invitation and join the Alchemy Guild. This place suits me more anyway." He nodded in affirmation. A glint of happiness flashed past Ellie's eyes as she happily said, "Very good. At least you know good from wrong. You will know soon that this was a life-changing decision."Don't worry, I will personally arrange for someone to send you toward the Epic Plains and then help you to increase your blood force, and if you perform well, a Wiser Type Epic Bloodline is not out of options either."Jacob's squinted his eyes when he heard this!

Chapter 249 Faery Human
﻿Jacob asked with squinted eyes, "I would like to hear about this Wiser Type Bloodline. By any chance, are you suggesting that bloodline can be transfused with higher ones?"Ellie snickered playfully, "Epic Plains are at least a thousand years ahead of Rare Plains in technology alone. So, you can guess if it's possible or not. The Rare Plains progress had been slowed down because of those selfish freedom lords."'Again, Freedom Lords? I should check them out later. It's my second time hearing this title. As for the technology being a thousand years ahead of rare plains, then the Epic Plains should be around the same level as my previous world or even more advanced.'This means hiding there would be even more bothersome than Rare Plains since they will have a web of surveillance everywhere. And is me not taking magic technology into consideration yet.' Jacob thought, as he knew too well how difficult it was to hide from an Advanced Civilization.Ellie took Jacob's silence for something completely different as she thought he was stunned by the sheer news that an Epic Bloodline could be transfused. At the same time, this wasn't even a thing of consideration in Jacob's mind right now.Still, Ellie didn't know as she continued with a hint of disdain, "I'm going to send an official member invitation on your ID. Since your Star Watch is Type-1 Grade, it would be quite easy, just tap on accept, and the process will start. We'll talk about the bloodline after you become an official member."Jacob snapped out of his thoughts as he glanced at Ellie impassively, and he nodded, "Fair enough."The very next moment, another interface suddenly pooped up."Amiable Monk Fish Sent you 'Bronze Invitation of Alchemy Guild.'"Accept / Reject"(NOTE: Upon selecting 'Accept,' you will be giving the 'Alchemy Guild' access to use your Star Watch's scanning features one time.)""Bronze Invitation? What is this?" Jacob didn't accept instantly and questioned while looking at Ellie.A glint of unhappiness flashed past Ellie's eyes when she saw Jacob didn't accept the invitation; instead, he was questioning him like she was harming him or something.Still, she answered the question with a tingle of dissatisfaction in her voice, "It's a special invitation, only available to the Vice President or President of the Alchemy Guild, and we can instantly use it to make anyone a reserve member without going through the trouble of taking a test or waiting for any approval." Jacob frowned behind his mask, "Is that all?"Ellie's eyes narrowed, "What else? Are you by any chance doubting me?" Her vibe instantly became dangerous.Jacob looked deeply at Ellie's veiled face, 'If she dared to play any trick. I'll just kill her for her heart later.'With such a dangerous thought, he averted his eyes and tapped on accept.The very next moment,"You (Faceless Ancient) have accepted the Bronze Invitation of Alchemy Guild sent by Amiable Monk Fish."Alchemy Guild has given access to your Star Watch scanning features (One Time)."Scanning features have been activated by the Alchemy Guild.""Life Signal test pass!"Species classified as 'Unknown' in the Common Plains Database."Species classified as 'Unknown' in the Rare Plains Database."Species classified as 'Faery Human' in the Epic Plains Database."Species Rank is 'Above Epic'"DNA scanning start…"DNA is not registered in the database. A new member has been detected!"Searching for Star Network ID and other information…"ID detected, 'Faceless Ancient…"Bank Account Detected…"Scanning has been completed!"Faceless Ancient, you have been registered as a Member of the Alchemy Guild."You have been appointed as Reserve Alchemist."Your Current Rank 1-Star Reserve Alchemist."Confidential Information about the Membership has been sent to your star watch account. Please don't share it with anyone!"Jacob's eyes were affixed on the 'Faery Human,' which was the first time he ever saw his species being classified as such. Furthermore, he was completely baffled by the Species' Rank.'What is going on? Faery Human a species Above Epic Rank? Could it be it was the true species of this body's previous owner before I got reincarnated as him?' The more Jacob thought, the more he felt it was likely true.But he was still somewhat at a loss since this was completely unexpected because he always thought he was from the common plains like other humans. He didn't have any interest in this body's background, so he never paid much attention or did any research.However, this new revelation about his species changed everything because if he belonged to such a powerful race, then how the hell did he end up in the hands of Decker and why?"Good. From now on, you are an official member of Alchemy Guild, and I'm looking forward to meeting you here." Ellie snickered as she also received the confirmation that Jacob accepted her invitation with a hint of astuteness hidden in her cat eyes.'So, she wasn't able to see any of these?' Jacob felt relief when he saw Ellie was completely oblivious to the information he had just seen.Because he didn't want anyone to know about this at all since he had no idea what kind of species Faery Human was and where did he stand within their ranks, it might bring some unwanted trouble, and he was quite sure they were not weak bunch either.They were at least a Unique Rank Species, and he was no match for such begins, so he wanted to remain as far from them as possible and possibly never meet them in his life.But he was still confused, "Miss Ellie, can this watch scan someone's blood higher than extraordinary species?"Jacob clearly knows that his star watch can only scan an extraordinary, not epic rank, because he had tried before.However, somehow it was able to scan that he was a Faery Human and even tell his bloodline was Above Epic Rank, which was completely out of place.Ellie coolly replied, "Of course not. But the Alchemy Guild is a treasure trove of knowledge, so our guild's AI, White Sage, is special. It can search a higher plain database from the plain it was being used, unlike the other two hegemonies' Artificial Intelligences. Why are you asking? Don't tell me White Sage just used its authority on you and searched the Epic Plains database?" She asked curiously.Jacob didn't show any reaction as he merely said, "How can that be? I was just curious, that's all. Now can you tell me more about these bloodlines?" He quickly changed the topic.As a peculiar glint flashed past his eyes, 'I need to be even more careful in Epic Plains!'

Chapter 250 Two Paths
﻿Ellie didn't find Jacob's words suspicious, or she was too proud to bother with small details.Anyhow, she answered his previous question, "Alright, since you joined the Guild, I will naturally tell you this information is limited to Epic Plains' three hegemonies members."As I said before, in Epic Rank, you need to decide a path of Magic or Combatant. You should know about the two categories of species, Fighter and Wiser. These two categories are the deciding factor of someone's path in Epic Rank.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "In Epic Rank, a species undergoes an evolution according to their bloodline compatibility to either Combatant Path or Magic Path. The Fighter Species are 99% end up evolving in the path of Combatant. While the Wiser Species, 99%, end up in the path of Magic."These two paths are essentially different from each other and have their own pros and cons. The Combatant Path is the path of Battle in which a species evolved in the way toward fighting, like stronger physiques, melee innate abilities, Combat Magic, battle sense, and such."We called them Combatants and the Bank's mercenaries, and the Alliance is mostly filled with them."However, the path of Wiser Species is the pure path of Magic. Although they didn't have strong physiques or battle sense and couldn't practice Combat Magic which is only made for strong physiques, even Extraordinary Physiques aren't enough to practice Combat Magic."But the magic destructive power, superior analyzing abilities, natural talent in alchemy, larger mana reserves, and such are far more than enough to put a Wiser above those Combatants. They are known as Sorcerers, and I'm also a Sorceress." Ellie proudly stated.Jacob was in deep thought after getting this new information on the two categories. He always thought there was a huge difference between the two, and now it was quite clear.'So, the Epic Rank, in a sense, is a divided factor between two categories, and the difference between them becomes clear as day, unlike the Extraordinary Rank. Both sides had their own pros and cons, like a Combatant will be able to kill a Sorcerer as long as it closed the distance.'The same goes for Sorcerer if it spotted the Combatant before it could reach it. Furthermore, this Combat Magic seemed quite unique, and in a sense, my strength is purely in the physical department with no trace of magic whatsoever.'However, I appeared as a blanker back then, and even Immortika dropped some subtle hints at something then. I'm missing an important piece of the puzzle, and it might be the key to awake magic….'Jacob couldn't help but think in this direction, as magic power was always a sore thumb in his heart. But he couldn't find the answer and always reached a dead end."Vice President, is there more information on Combatants and Sorcerers in the market?" Jacob asked. He didn't want to show his lack of magic knowledge in front of Ellie since she seemed well-versed in magic.Because he was an anomaly because he had an Epic Rank Physique but not a corresponding magic core, he was pretty sure he would appear as a valuable test subject in many people's eyes if this fact were made public.Besides, he wasn't sure if Ellie would even spare the time to give him more information than she had already promised. He had already sensed the change in her attitude after he accepted her invitation.So, he didn't want to fall off with her, not before he consolidated his position in the Alchemy Guild, or he might repeat the same incident with Gunnar.Furthermore, the Alchemy Guild President didn't approach him personally, so that guy was still a mystery, and his attitude toward him. So, he was quite careful now.Just as he thought, Ellie seemed slightly impatient as she replied, "There is naturally all kinds of information in our private server. But it is bounded by the rank of a plain. So, you need to enter Epic Plains to see the information about Epic Plains. It is that simple."Now that you are already a reserve member, I want you to become an official member in three years. Because in these three years, including you, there will be 11 more alchemists joining you in the voyage toward Epic Plains. Someone will approach you in the alchemy guild in the dark city when the time arrives."The Rare Plains' situation is getting worse as those Dark Beings are totally going for the annihilation of the Freedom Plains before the reinforcement from our side reaches the Rare Plains."But you don't have to worry. As long as you stay in the dark city, you'll be safe. I want you to focus on getting rid of the reserve member status in these three years. I'll give you 10,000 ZC. It should be more than enough for your studies and meet the requirement to become an official member."Don't disappoint me or slack off, or you'll regret it. My eyes are always on you!"With this mysterious statement, Ellie ended the projection call, leaving Jacob frowning.'Why is her end goal? Whatever it is, it can't be achieved unless I reach the Epic Plains, it seems.' Jacob thought as he felt Ellie was hiding her motives related to him.Although she didn't have malicious intent, he could tell she was more like a control freak who wanted everything under her thumb and enjoyed suppressing people.'What a strange day.' Jacob sighed as he felt too much had happened in one day, and it all started after he passed the Senior Grandmaster test.If he knew so much trouble would follow, he might not even take the test. But he knew he needed the Alchemy Guild's Magic Smith Workshop, so this would've happened sooner or later.Since things were over, he now had some more information about the Epic Plains power structure. That place seemed completely under the control of three hegemonies, and their means were quite imposing.Afterward, he opened the messages he received after joining the alchemy guild.Like the Alliance, the first message was about the rules and regulations of the Alchemy Guild and their ranking system. There were Nine Stars Ranks for Reserve Alchemists.He was again given two types of identity badges, one for Reserve Alchemist, which was his real identity. The second one is for the rare plains, and they were plenty of them. Even Magic Smith's badge was among them, and all of them could be shown up to Senior Grandmaster Ranks, so he was quite content with it.In the third message, he received 100 Zodiac credits after entering the Alchemy Guild.As for the fourth message, the moment he opened them, he received two promotions, and they were quite familiar.'You have successfully Joined the Private Star Server (Rare Alchemists)'You have successfully Joined the Private Star Server (Freedom Plains Alchemists)Jacob scoffed and opened the last message, knowing what it could be. He saw a star network link and opened it without hesitation.An application started to get installed in his star watch, and soon, he saw the emblem of the Alchemist Guild appearing in his star watch.His lips curled up as he opened the Alchemist Guild's Application!
