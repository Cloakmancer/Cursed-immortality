Chapter 51 Common Knowledge
﻿Jacob exited the pub with an impassive expression, 'I just kill a human for the first time and didn't feel a thing? Is it because of the book, or it's just my true nature thriving after I stop resisting it?'Jacob thought a little about it and headed toward the bookstore. He won't provoke anyone and kill wantonly as long as the other party won't show any kind of hostility or killing intent.Furthermore, this town was completely lawless. That was why Jacob directly go for the kill because he could easily discriminate Miller was eyeing his possessions from the start.That was the reason he first started a conversation to probe about his backing and seeing him ignorant about the common customs, he directly labeled him as a target and provoke him.But since Jacob didn't react in any manner or start a fight, he wanted to kill Jacob when he got the chance and reason, but he would've never thought Jacob's danger sense was not something a chubby like Miller could have.Even if his back was facing someone, Jacob's ears were like radar, and he could easily discriminate sounds like heartbeats and so on. That was what spelled Miller's doom.This will also warn the others who were looking at him like he was a fat pig. It was just like that saying, kill the chicken to scare the monkey.Now, no one would dare to label him as an easy target.After a while, he finally found an old, rundown shop that looked like it wasn't maintained for decades.When he opened the door, a small bell chimed, and he entered the shop. He saw an old grandma napping in her chair. Even the bell didn't wake her up. Jacob's lips curled upward, and he didn't disturb the old lady and started to skim through old books on the old shelves.'Uncommon Species Region History?' He was drawn by this thin book's title and took it out, reading it.The more he read, the more his expression sank.First, he found out that the uncommon region wasn't just dominated by humans, and there were two more intelligent, uncommon races with their kingdoms, like humans.These three kingdoms rule the uncommon region together, and the human kingdom was established last and was the weakest of them as well.The human kingdom, name Humane Kingdom, was established over five hundred years ago by an ambitious human, Philip Grover, who unite the humans who lived in tribes before, and they were always hunted down by the other two kingdoms like livestock.The other two kingdoms were the Aureate Kingdom established by the Green Goblin race and the Earthen Kingdom established by Hob-Trolls.Both races had excellent relationships with each other, but not with humans because they were supposed to be their food. How could they accept them as an equal?Furthermore, the Goblins were famous for their engineering technology, and all the guns and other firearms blueprints were plundered from them. While the Hob-Trolls were known for their craftsmanship, they also help quite a lot in human development to this stage.However, to grow, humans have to fight endlessly with these two races and evolved. But those two races have very strong foundations, and it wasn't enough for current humans to shake them.That was why to not cause huge wars with them and stop them from teaming up. The Humane Kingdom will pay annual tributes to those two kingdoms.Although Jacob's expressions remain impassive, his eyes were deadly cold when he read humans pay tributes to others and live like dogs, especially when he saw goblins were involved as well.His grudge against the goblin race was quite deep, so he was naturally unhappy about this.But he also noticed that this tribute rule was established after the first king, Philip's death, or as long as he was alive, humans never lower their heads and even pushed two races back.'This has happened when some spineless bastard took the leadership, and now they need to pay some monsters to not attack? I'm mortified!'Jacob was from a world where humans were at the top and there was nothing they can't conquer, but here he felt these world's humans were even qualified to call themselves humans.In the end, he simply put the book back. He wasn't here to liberate humanity, nor he was interested in the power struggle. He already had his fun in his previous life.Furthermore, he was going to use anyone to reach his own goal, Immortality!Afterward, he browsed through more books and broaden his horizons.He also found the distribution of currency in his world.The lowest currency was bronze coins. Then a silver coin, which was equivalent to 100 bronze coins. Then there were gold coins. One gold coin was equivalent to 100 silver coins.All this currency was managed by the Zodiac Taurus Bank, which was like the Apothecary Guild, everywhere!Its origin was also unknown, while no one dare to mess with them and all the currency was controlled by them.Another hegemony and they monopolized the money!Moreover, only nobles were eligible to open a bank account in this bank, and they won't accept commoners.He also found some more information about the Apothecary Guild. They not only controlled the medicines but also apothecaries in the kingdoms and without their license if an apothecary tended to someone or sell his medicine they will be imprisoned by the guild!Jacob suddenly felt this world was ruled by powerful people, not on the base of equality like his previous one. He also noticed the 'Taurus' word with Zodiac and couldn't help but thought of the twelve zodiac signs.But regretfully, there wasn't any knowledge about continents or zodiac plains here. There was the same as Decker's journal. They only know the name Zodiac Plains and the five regions that were it!Jacob spends the entire afternoon in this shop while the old lady was still sound asleep, and familiarized himself with the common knowledge of the Humane Kingdom.After he was done, he left a silver on the counter and left the shop. His next destination was a smithery!

Chapter 52 Jacob’s Plan
﻿Jacob didn't have to wander around for long before he came in front of a small store with a femerell which was quite unusual in this town.There was a small name board on the wooden door, 'Isaac Smithery'.Jacob entered the smithery and felt the high temperature inside, unfazed by it, his eyes landed on the weapon display, where all kinds of cold weapons were shown."Welcome to my humble establishment, dear customer." A polite, firm voice sounded from the side.Jacob looked over and saw a burly man with a long beard. He was Isaac, the blacksmith, and owner of this smithery.Jacob nodded in greeting and directly stated his request, "I want to make something. I wonder if you're up to the task?"Isaac smile confidently and said, "As long as you have a design, I can forge anything!""Is that so? Give me something to draw." Jacob curled his lip. Isaac was startled by Jacob's request. He carefully looked at Jacob. "Are you serious?""What, you think I'm messing with you?" Jacob smirked."Well, you don't seem like such a person. Here, you can draw on this." Isaac was an honest man, so he thought a little of it and handed Jacob a notepad and pencil.Jacob didn't delay and started to draw the distillation equipment. Since he can't find the equipment, he might make them, and they weren't difficult to make as well.Isaac was also astonished when he saw Jacob's elegant drawing and couldn't help but praise him inwardly."Here." Jacob handed the design to Isaac. "How long will it take to make them?"Isaac solemnly looked at the design and said, "Three days!"Jacob nodded in agreement. "You want payment now or when I recover the goods?""You need to pay half right now and the other half the day of delivery." Isaac stated, "It'll be five silver coins and five on the day of delivery.""Here." Jacob didn't care about money as long as he was spending it on himself. "If I like your work, I might order even more."After saying that, Jacob left the smithery.'Although I can make far better firearms myself, I need gunpowder for bullets and bullets only sell in the mercenary agency. But I have to acquire an identity first, and I still didn't know if I'm a native of the Humane Kingdom, it will be troublesome.'I still didn't know who this body belonged to and why this guy was sold as a slave to that bastard. I didn't have memories of his life, but I somehow understand and read the language of this world, which means he wasn't some lowlife and probably schemed against.'Now that I think about it, the Humane Kingdom didn't have slave trading since they didn't have the right to make other races their slaves, and it was probably them who was captured by slave traders to become slaves.'This means this body was probably captured and then somehow entered the rare region or somewhere close to it. Decker was being chased at that time, and he won't dare to show his face in the rare region. Just who was he…'Jacob was always curious about the real identity of this body. It wasn't because he wanted to seek revenge or care about him, but was afraid of trouble!It was already clear that someone wanted to get rid of this body's previous owner, and they even wanted him to suffer before he died, and it happened as well.But who would've thought Jacob would be reborn in this body after the person died by Decker's experiment?Nevertheless, Jacob was careful, and he was planning to remain in the rain town for the time being. Because the rainy mountain ranges were close to it, he could easily hunt and then absorb the heart's essence.It won't be too late to move to the cities when he needed, but there were still many things for him to understand about this place.'I should register with the Star Mercenary Agency, which is also sponsored by the Zodiac Taurus Bank. It's the only place that sells and buys animals and beasts, while they also sell firearms and the things I require. They had branches all over the Humane Kingdom as well. According to the book, anyone can be registered with them as long as they had skills.'After making up his mind, Jacob started to find a place to stay.Thereupon, with one silver coin, he rented an old house for seven months, where he could easily extract the heart essence and live. But more importantly, this house was on the edge of rain town, and he could easily sneak in Pig Head for the time being.He never thought of getting rid of him unless he died himself. Pig Head became even more important after he understood the uncommon region's structure and human strength.As long as he could find those liquids in the apothecary guild, there was still hope for Pig Head.At night, Jacob sneaked out of the rain town since the security was as shitty as it could get and sneaked in Pig Head into the old house basement and felt relief.---While Jacob was settling in the Rain Town, inside the lord's mansion of the rain town,A middle age man with a noble bearing had a hideous face right now as he looked at the city guard."Are you sure Lord Gus's group hasn't come back yet?" He sternly asked with a flustered look on his face.The guard nodded, "Yes, my lord, just as you instructed, I was paying attention to Lord Gus's group returned, but they weren't back yet.""Do you know what this means? If they went missing or anything happened to Lord Gus or his sister, our entire town will be executed!" the town lord roared as he trembled in anger.The guard didn't dare to raise his head anymore; he knew what will happen if the children of a Baron household went missing from rain town.At this moment, another guard entered, and he was panting for breath as he said, "M-Miss… Jennifer has returned with injuries, but… she's alone!"

Chapter 53 Star Mercenary Agency (1)
﻿The next morning,Jacob felt refreshed after sleeping in an actual room, without being careful about any animal attacks or running rainwater from the roof.After dressing in casual clothes of the natives, which he bought from the rain town the other day."I should get the identity of a star mercenary first today. That place should be close to the Town Lord's Mansion…" Jacob locked the door and headed toward the most prominent area of Rain Town.The Star Mercenary Agency was established and sponsored by the Zodiac Taurus Bank when the Humane Kingdom was founded. This agency was not only exclusive to the Humane Kingdom but, just like the bank, its roots were widely spread.The Star Mercenary Agency was quite lax with the members and its purpose was quite simple: they would accept missions from anyone for commission, and as long as you have sufficient mercenary rank, you can take the mission and earn corresponding rewards.Furthermore, besides the mission, they also deal with the animals and beasts as well as anything that can interest them. They have an ample amount of resources to buy anything.That was what make the Star Mercenary Agency so compelling to common folks. But this job was also very dangerous, and few survived the life of a mercenary.The rain town plaza was the most bustling place in the entire town. It was not because of the lord's mansion, but because the building of Star Mercenary Agency was located here, and it was even more lavish than the lord's mansion.Many mercenaries were going in and out. Some held large bags dripping with blood, while some were going in to accept the mission.At this moment, a silver hair man appeared outside the building, drawing some attention, but not much.Everyone was minding their own business because in the Star Mercenary Agency there wasn't any rule about any infight and if you provoke someone with a deep background, you might die on your next mission mysteriously.Especially a place like the Rain Town, which was closest to the rainy mountain ranges, and many adventurous souls come here and some of them vanished without any traces.It was a very common case, so no one dare to provoke anyone, not without knowing their background first.Jacob entered the lavish building and saw a spacious hall with some tables and chairs. Many mercenary teams were discussing their mission while some were waiting.'Now, this place has the vibes of a fantasy place.' Jacob curled his lips slightly.His eyes scan the place when they landed on a huge blackboard with many posters and there was a huge crowd swarming around it.Then he noticed a large counter in the west, and five beautiful receptionists were dealing with queues of mercenaries.He directly headed their way. He noticed the bronze signs in front of those five receptionists.'Mission Registration & Information, Mission Completion & Rewards, Material Sales, Material Trade, and Registration.'Jacob looked at the queue in front of the Registration Counter, which was the shortest, and join them as he waited for his turn.Jacob observed the person at the very front, and he was answering the questions of the receptionist as she noted them down on a paper.After the questioning was done, she handed him the paper and direct him toward the stairs not far away from the counter, and he headed toward the second floor.After waiting for fifteen minutes, it was finally Jacob's turn.The receptionist was a pale skin beauty with long black hair and sharp eyes, any man couldn't resist her invisible charm."First and Last Name." She said impassively, as she didn't glance at Jacob and kept her eye on the registration form.It was her daily job, so she cared little about who took the test since there wasn't anything worth seeing in this countryside town.Jacob also impassively answered, "Jacob Steve." He didn't hide his name since it, he wasn't a wanted criminal or any refuge, so it wasn't worth hiding.She jotted it down before she called again, "Age and gender.""Male, 24.""Citizenship?""Gloria Country, Rain Town.""Please show me your identity proof."Jacob had already seen the person before him giving an identity proof, which looked like the identity card he found in Decker's possessions.He coolly said, "I lost it."The receptionist finally tilted her head and looked at Jacob, her eyes dilated slightly at seeing such a handsome man in this town.She said with a hint of gentleness, "Sir, if you didn't have any identity proof, you have to pay ten times the registration fee."Jacob's eyes flash for a moment. "One gold coin?"She nodded. "Yes, the registration fee is 10 silver coins, but without any identity proof, you have to pay the penalty.""Come on, man, if you didn't have money, get out of the way." A burly with average height sneered impatiently.Jacob didn't retort and took out a gold coin from his pocket and put it on the counter. "Thank you for your trouble." He had twenty gold coins from Decker, and now nineteen were left.The receptionist smiled and received the gold coin. Before she filled the identity section.The man behind Jacob also showed an embarrassed smile, but he didn't dare to speak anymore. He was silently afraid that Jacob would take revenge.Anyone who could take out a gold coin wasn't someone ordinary in the rain town.The receptionist handed Jacob a paper with his information and said with a smile, "Please go to the second floor, where an examiner will test your strength and allocate you a corresponding mercenary rank." "Thanks." Jacob received the form and headed toward the second floor, minding his own business.When it was finally the burly man's turn, the receptionist's expression turned stony again as she said, "Fifty silver coins first."The burly man's face fell, and he knew he will have to pay the price for his foul mouth since he can't cause trouble for the managing staff, or he could just forget about the mercenary license!

Chapter 54 Star Mercenary Agency (2)
﻿The floor was also the same size as the first floor, but there weren't any desks or tables, but typical training equipment, a fighting ring, and an eye-catching black pillar with a dark screen on the top.Jacob notice all the people before him, were gathering around that dark pillar, and there was a tall, muscular man standing beside the black pillar.As he headed the same way, he saw the tall man take the form of a dark skin person, and he said coolly, "Punch with your full strength. Anything lower than 100 KG force is failed. You'll get two chances, and your fee will not be refunded if you failed."The dark skin person nodded since he already knows the rules of Star Mercenary Agency's entry test.Everyone watched with great interest. Some veteran mercenaries were also present to rope in promising newcomers. Many mercenary teams scout and recruited their members this way.The dark skin man punched with full power, and his vibrant punch landed on the dark pillar.Everyone looked at the top screen, and a string of numbers appeared."98"The examiner nonchalantly uttered. "Last Chance."The dark skin man's face heated when he felt those gazes filled with ridicule.He took a deep breath before he punched again with everything he had.A new number appeared on the dark screen, "95""Next!"The examiner didn't even look at the dark skin man who seemed to have lost his soul.The next person entered and moved toward the black pillar with an anxious face.In the end, he only managed to score 84 and 87, which meant he also failed.Jacob remained uninterested in other participants and wait for his turn silently.At this moment, a tall woman with 5.11 height, an oval face, slender waist, and long legs wearing tight garments moved forward.The examiner's eyes lit up, seeing this woman's long legs and big bosom. He smiled lewdly as he said, "Sugar, don't break your hand here. If you failed, you can always look for me, I'll support you.""Hmph, asshole." The woman snorted coldly with contempt.The examiner didn't mind, and his smile widen as he looked at her form, 'Rosalia, huh? A thorny rose indeed.'Rosalia completely ignored everyone's coarse expressions and let loose a punch with an angry shout.'Bang…'Everyone looked at the dark screen without any high expectation, but what appeared made many scalps tingle with dread."132"'What?' the examiner's eyes widen as his view of this woman changed in an instant and many others.If they see her as an easy and delicate prey before, now they didn't dare to underestimate her anymore.This much strength can't achieve just by playing hunter but only with years of practice.However, the show still wasn't over. She suddenly moved her voluptuous hips and struck the black pillar with her long leg, which created a booming sound.Another number appeared, which shocked everyone."201"The examiner finally spoke with a hint of enthusiasm, "Rosalia Lion, Rank D Mercenary! Welcome to the Star Mercenary Agency!"Rosalia give him a dead stare and asked, "Where can I get my license?"The examiner didn't seem flustered at all, but he also didn't show any strange expressions anymore. He smiled as he started to write down on her form and then stamped it with a star stamp.He handed her the form and said, "Go to the third floor. You can get your Star Mercenary License after handing this form."Rosalia took the form and head toward the third floor without giving anyone a second glance. She even ignored those mercenaries who came to invite her to their teams."Next." The examiner continued the test.After Rosalia, no one pass the test, and then it was Jacob's turn.The examiner nonchalantly repeated himself and signal him to start.'Another pretty boy wanted to show off, but the poor thing chose the wrong place.' He sneered inwardly as he looked at Jacob's appearance.Although he was tall and muscular, he didn't look anything special from other experts' perceptive.Jacob suddenly asked impassively, "I heard the higher one's ranked, the more benefits they'll get from the Star Mercenary Agency, right?"The examiner plainly replied, "Yes."Jacob merely nodded and took a boxer's stance before he performed a hammer strike with fifty percent of his power.The examiner naturally knows about 'Knight Boxing', which was commonly used among the knights.'Is he from a knight family?' His eyes narrowed slightly.This time, he seemed extremely interested in Jacob's strength as he looked at the screen."464"Everyone was flabbergasted by that number and looked at the silver hair, Jacob as if they were looking at a monster.Even the examiner felt his heart palpitate seeing that number since it was almost equivalent to his own!"I don't want to use the second chance, is that, ok?" Jacob calmly looked at the examiner.'If I used my full power, I'm afraid it will draw unwanted attention,' Jacob mused. He also got the general idea of just how strong he was.Examiner took a deep breath and solemnly nodded. "Jacob Steve, Rank C Mercenary! Welcome to the Star Mercenary Agency!"He wrote his evaluation and handed him his form, but he whispered something in his ear that only Jacob heard."I'm the Vice Leader of this branch, 'Ralf '. A word of advice: don't join any mercenary team in rain town. Visit in eight days. I'll introduce you to the Agency Leader."Jacob received the form showing no expression.Ralf wink meaningfully at Jacob before he continued the test.'Agency Leader, huh? If I have time, I might,' Jacob sneered inwardly, completely talking Ralf's words as wind.He simply didn't care about anything except the identity of a star mercenary and their items.Nothing interests him, especially working for someone else while they reap the benefits of his hard labor.He had played this game many times in his past life!

Chapter 55 Mercenary Ranks
﻿On the third floor, there were another counter, tables, and seats.Jacob spotted Rosalia on a table in one corner, and she was the only one present on this floor. She was waiting for that mercenary license.She also noticed Jacob and her eyes flashed, but she didn't react in any way and remained aloof.Jacob also minded his own business and headed toward the counter, where another beautiful receptionist was sitting and reading a book.She heard Jacob's footsteps and look over. She smiled and greeted, "Good Day Sir, congratulations on passing the entry test. May I have your registration form?"Jacob nodded in greeting and handed her the paper in his hand.However, the receptionist's expression suddenly changed when she was 'C Rank' on the form and exclaimed, "C Rank from the start?!"Her voice was quite loud, which was clearly heard by Rosalia, and her eyes were also wide with astonishment as she looked at the silver hair man impassively standing in front of the counter.She was quite arrogant with the D Rank, but even she knew the threshold for receiving C Rank directly was 450KG+ force, and it wasn't something easy to achieve.In the star mercenary agency, there were 6 ranks, F, E, D, C, B, and A respectively.The lowest rank F was for those who had only 100 KG of force, while the E was for those with force above 150, while D was for those with above 200.Even D Rank mercenaries were respected everywhere they go because they could be considered at the peak of the uncommon rank fighters.While from C rank to A rank, these ranks were for those fighters who can fight with Rare Rank Species!The threshold for a C rank was 450+ and these mercenaries were treated like nobles in the Humane Kingdom, and they all have prominent positions. Just like, the Leader and Vice Leader of this Rain Town branch were C-rank mercenaries.As for B Rank, the threshold was 1000KG+ force and there weren't even 10 presents in the Humane Kingdom and every one of them were monsters in human skin because they can fight with top rare rank beasts.Lastly, in the A rank, the threshold was 10,000KG+ force and these rank mercenaries were something only those top of the list Rare Races which rules the rare region could have!That was why the C Rank was respected in the entire humane kingdom, and they have many privileges of nobles and no one dared to provoke them!Jacob also know this, and that was why he wanted this rank, so he didn't have to worry about moving around or acquiring anything from the mercenary agency.If he wanted, he could pass the B Rank mercenary trial, but it would be too high profile, and he would have appeared on some people's kill list thereupon.So, C Rank was perfect for him, and no one would mess with him easily. This will also spare him the trouble to deal with those annoying flies who will come after him for his wealth.Just like a few moments ago, when he was heading up, no one dare to approach him for recruitment because they didn't have the strength to talk equally with him.One had to know there was only one mercenary team with a C Rank leader who was active in the Rain Town.Furthermore, Jacob didn't use his second chance, which gave him another veil of mystery, and those people have trend careful with him now just like Ralf, who didn't act arrogantly in front of Jacob and politely invite him. The receptionist finally snapped out of her stupor and her tone became extremely respectful, "Please wait. I'll arrange your star mercenary license in fifteen minutes."Jacob smile faintly and nodded, "I'll be great, thank you."With that, he also sat at another table and watch the receptionist hastily entering the door behind her counter.'Finally, I can move freely now without having to worry about my identity. As for that B Rank, I have to wait to exit the Humane Kingdom and took the test in the rare region.'A Rank is still far from me, and it also made it clear there are far more powerful existences out there, and being invincible among humans means nothing. My goal should be those hegemonies at Epic Region!' Jacob mused as he made plans for his future.His eyes suddenly flashed as he looked toward the person who has suddenly joined him at his table. This person was none other than Rosalia!Jacob impassively looked at the fierce beauty in front of him, and he had to admit, that if she was in his previous world, she would be a top model. But those models were nothing to him back then. As long as he wanted, they would jump into his bed!He said impassively, "You want something?"Rosalia was stunned for a moment. She suddenly felt this man's gaze differed completely from others, and it felt like in his eyes she was nothing but skin and bones.She bit her lips and said, "Are you really a C Rank mercenary?""That's why they said." He answered with a shrugged shoulder.She took a deep breath, and she said with deep resolve, "Team up with me!"Jacob felt quite amusing when he saw her forced expression. It was like someone had beaten her to say this. But he didn't reject her instantly and question back, "Why would I?"Rosalia suddenly felt vexed by Jacob's attitude. She pursed her lips and said, "I want to gain a foothold in this place, and to do so, I want someone like you by my side. Besides, teaming up with me won't be a bad thing since you know I just pass the test with you, and you won't have to worry about me approaching you with ulterior motives."Jacob curled his lips. "That's what you said."She suddenly lost her temper and stood up from her seat. "Hmph, I'll make you regret your decision. Don't think you're invincible just because you're a C Rank Mercenary!"Before it was she who showed temper and attitude everywhere she goes, but it was the first time something showed her attitude and look down on her. How could she take it?"I believed you." Jacob merely scoffed, watching her stomping away!

Chapter 56 C-Rank Mercenary (1)
﻿Jacob didn't want to entangle with Rosalia even if she offered herself to him because that woman had a peculiar attitude that can't be established by a humble background and only those who have lived their life in luxury and prosperity have this kind of attitude.She was also quite a short temper and wasn't good at requesting, which made it clearer that she was used to getting whatever she wanted with a single order this make her background even more obvious.Most importantly, the Star Mercenary Agency didn't have absolute records on who registered with them and how many times they can be registered with different names.This was the biggest loophole in this system. As long as you can pay the price, you can take the test and get another identity.Although Jacob wasn't sure if this was deliberately left or the agency didn't care about it. But after mulling over it for some time, he concluded that a hegemony like the Zodiac Taurus Bank won't leave this kind of loophole without any reason. There had to be some kind of deeper meaning behind it.That was why he didn't even believe Rosalia's word for a second that she has taken the test here and was here to get a foothold in rain town. She had some ulterior motive, and if he decided to team up with her, he might get involved in something he didn't want.Besides, he wasn't planning on teaming up with anyone, as a matter of fact. Even if Rosalia was good at acting, he would've still rejected her no matter what she offered him.At this point, nothing interested him except anything that was related to the cursed immortality.While he was deep in thought and waiting for that license, another man appeared on the third floor, which also mean he had passed the test.Surprisingly, it was the burly man who picked on Jacob at the registration counter on the first floor.When saw Jacob, he was startled for a moment before his eyes landed on Rosalia, who was scowling at Jacob, and his eyes flashed with rapture.He first goes to the counter; the receptionist was already back to her position as she glanced at Jacob now and then before she noticed that man coming in her way with a big smile.She greeted him like before, but she was somewhat cold and when she looked at the man's form, there was 'F Rank' which means he just barely pass.She told him to wait like everyone else and headed toward the door behind again.The burly man's name was, 'Luka' and he first went to Jacob and smiled apologetically, "Brother, I'm sorry about the way I spoke with you in the line. I hope you don't take it to heart. Congratulation on passing the test. What's your rank?"Jacob give him a death glare and said, "Don't disturb me."Luka's expression fell slightly, but he wasn't interested in Jacob at all. He was just making sure he won't find trouble with him for what happened.Ignoring Jacob, he quickly moved toward Rosalia, and she was what he was truly interested in.He smiled brightly as he was about to strike a conversion with her when she stared at him with killing intent as she uttered viciously, "Scram, or I'll break your teeth in five seconds!"Luka felt a sudden chill on his spine and he suddenly felt this woman was extremely dangerous, so he quickly fled and sat down on the corner without making any noise. He suddenly felt he was in the presence of wolves.At this moment, the receptionist appeared again, but she didn't appear behind her counter but in the hall, from another door, which drew everyone's attention.She approached Jacob with a smile as she said, "Sir, please follow me."Jacob looked meaningfully at her before he nodded and followed her toward the room in Rosalia and Luck's peculiar gazes. The room was only medium size and there was a table and chairs where a middle-aged man was sitting on the other side.When he saw Jacob enter, he stood up and said attentively, "It's my pleasure to meet with Mr. Jacob. Please take a seat. Thanks for the trouble Nyla, please give us the room."Nyla nodded and enter another door, which lead to her counter.Jacob calmly sat in front of this middle-aged man with a short beard.The middle-aged man said with a smile, "My name is Tudor, and I'm the registration manager of this branch. Your star mercenary license is ready, but since you've passed the C-Rank test, there's something we need to discuss before I handed you your license. I hope you understand it's a protocol.""Go on." Jacob nodded.Tudor explained, "You might've heard of the ranks of mercenaries, right?""Yes.""Then it would be easy to explain. You see, the D, E, and F ranks are very common, and you can have as many licenses of such ranks as you want. I'm sure you have noticed this loophole already?" Tudor smiled meaningfully.Jacob's eyes flashed and nodded, "Indeed."Tudor continued, "But from C Rank to A Rank, it wasn't the case, and we won't issue the same rank license more than once, and it'll be permanently registered within our database.""Are you implying that you guys can tell if I took another test somewhere else, and I won't be able to forge another identity of C Rank Mercenary? Is this also the test to see if I'm first time registering with the agency as well?" Jacob quickly got the point.Tudor was extremely happy to deal with such a person and nodded, "Yes, it's indeed the case because a C Rank Mercenary has special privileges, and we can't have others exploit the identity loophole on this rank."Although, the agency didn't care about C Rank as well. But because of humans' limited ability, they have agreed to arrange this process which was supposed to take place at B Rank."However, the benefits are still nothing compared to the B Rank, but they're still better than nothing, and they were only placed for the good of humanity and to strengthen it and the royal family had a big part in it!"

Chapter 57 C-Rank Mercenary (2)
﻿Jacob could feel the pride behind Tudor's words for humanity."What kind of benefits?" Jacob asked. He was only interested in benefits and didn't care who manage to put them there.Tudor suddenly took out a dark screen device from his drawer.Jacob's eyes contracted, seeing the dark screen device. It was exactly like the blood analysis device he had, but there weren't buttons on it, only a small pin. He felt extremely alarmed because he thought this device would reveal his real strength!He looked at Tudor and asked, "What is this?"Tudor didn't know Jacob had already come in contact with a high-tech device like this, so he explained,"This is the registration device for C Rank Mercenaries. You just have to press your finger on the pin, and it'll record something called Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) in your blood and record it within the agency database."Afterward, you'll be a C Rank mercenary and enjoy the benefits without worrying about anything. Just don't try to register with another branch at C Rank, or you'll get caught by this DNA Recorder."'Fuck, I knew the technology of humans in the uncommon region didn't match with Decker. But I never thought those from the higher regions will have such devices that can record DNA as well. This agency really has prominent roots!' Jacob cursed inwardly as he looked at the DNA Recorder.He suddenly regretted his decision to get C Rank from the start. If he had known they even know the DNA, he would never risk it.Because he wasn't sure after he started to follow the cursed immortality, his DNA might get changed, and if someone checked they might find something and expose his identity and secret.However, it was just his hypothesis. He had to be absolutely sure, he suddenly thought, "Cursed Immortality."The white book appeared right between him and Tudor, who didn't detect it at all.Jacob quickly asked, "I knew you heard everything. Tell me, can they find you out by my DNA or anything that can draw unwanted attention?" Immortika wrote, "Hehehe, I can't answer that."Jacob cussed before he changed his question, "Can heart essence change my DNA with injections?""No, for the time being. Besides, they can't find anything from your DNA. Are you an idiot? Just how many species are far more abnormal than you exist in this world? How could they suspect anything?"Jacob sighed in relief and looked at Tudor, he was waiting for t for Jacob's answer.Tudor knew no one wanted to give away something that can track them down, especially those who wanted to be mysterious and didn't want their identity exposed.If Jacob decided to back down, he would allocate him a D Rank license without any demands.However, Jacob suddenly moved his finger and press it on the pin.The screen suddenly lit up, and two words appeared: "Registration Successful!"Tudor smiled and put the DNA Recorder away and said, "Congratulation, you're officially a C Rank Mercenary."He then took out an envelope and put it in front of Jacob. He said, "In this envelope is your C Rank License, as well as the detail about your bank account in Zodiac Taurus Bank."Jacob cocked an eyebrow, "Bank Account in Zodiac Taurus Bank?"Tudor nodded with a smile, "Yes, this is one of the privileges of C Rank Mercenaries. They'll all get an account of their name after registration. You can use your mercenary card and special account code to get access to your account."Not only that, after you passed the C Rank test, you're rewarded with 100 Gold Coins, which had already been transferred to your account. Every month you'll receive 1 Gold Coin salary in your account."You can also use your bank account to pay for your purchases in any agency branch or received the money in the account directly. You don't need to go to the bank directly. Quite convenient, right?"This process was too familiar to Jacob, and he suddenly felt this was a good thing to have an account with the Zodiac Taurus Bank since it was the only bank here.He nodded, "Convenient indeed. Anything else?"Tudor noticed Jacob's uninterested expression and find it quite strange, since this process was only known to nobles, and it was also clear that Jacob has just registered with them. The DNA test just made it apparent.Nonetheless, he answered, "The other thing is you'll get a 5% discount on your purchases in any agency branch. And you don't have to get in line to receive or submit any missions, directly come to the third floor and your business will be dealt with instantly."Lastly, if you want a C Rank mission, look for Nyla. We don't post them on the mission board. And if you have any complaints, approach the Vice Leader or Leader, they'll prioritize you. That's all."Jacob nodded. The C Rank Mercenary was indeed a lucrative position, that was for sure, and he got many annoying things out of the way just by becoming one."Thank you for your trouble." Jacob picked up the envelope and stand up to take his leave.Tudor also stood up and said when Jacob was about to leave, "I just have the last thing to say. It's more of a personal request."Jacob halted his step and looked at Tudor while his hand was on the door handle.Tudor took a deep breath and said, "Please look out for your own kind." He bowed thereafter.Jacob felt this guy was really a patriot. He coolly said before he left, "It's not a promise."Tudor smiled wryly, "Sigh… At least he didn't reject me directly."Jacob put the envelope into his shirt pocket, while he actually put it inside the infinity pendant.Outside, he noticed another man has appeared, and he was happily chatting with Luka.Rosalia was the first to notice Jacob and frowned.Jacob ignored everyone and again appeared in front of Nyla. He said calmly, "I want to look at C Rank missions!"

Chapter 58 Town Lord
﻿Inside the lord's mansion,The town lord, Ciaran, was standing in front of a seated beauty with an agitated expression on his somewhat wrinkled face.Ciaran spoke politely, despite being the town lord, "Lady Jennifer, how're your injuries?"This beauty was indeed Gus's sister, Jennifer, who escaped from the wolf king chase and found her way back to rain town with some minor injuries.Jennifer replied impassively, "I'm fine. Thank you for asking Lord Ciaran. But I need to know if you found anything about my brother's whereabouts or Lady Kiana?"Ciaran's expression clouded at hearing this and thought resentfully, 'Bitch, you clearly knew what would've happened to them since you said there was a wolf king. But you insist on putting this façade and turning the trouble on my way…'He was extremely resentful and horrified after he heard there was a wolf king on the dark wolf ridge. But he was more afraid of the baron of Gloria's country because it was 95% possible that Gus was dead, and he had to suffer the backlash from the Baron for this.However, he had to deal with the wolf king first before giving an explanation to Baron. He knew, that as long as he could present the wolf king's head to the baron, he might escape the disaster with minimum losses.But he also knew to kill the wolf king, he needed to hire C Rank mercenaries and not just one but three or five, which will also cost him a fortune, since hiring those C Rank mercenaries wasn't cheap.But what can he do? If he didn't do something, even if the Baron didn't demolish his rain town, those wolves might!However, Jennifer was giving him more headaches with her princess attitude and making things difficult for him. She just insisted on searching for Gus, despite knowing their possible ending.Ciaran said with a forced smile, "I'm afraid we'll be only sending our men to their death if there's really a wolf king."Jennifer narrowed her eyes. "Are you implying I'm lying? Or those commoners' lives are more important than my brother and friend?"Ciaran felt unhappy inwardly, but he remained polite, "Milady, I know you're worried about your loved ones, but we have to send some powerful people. What if we found the young lord, but they drag him down? We can't have that, right?"Jennifer nodded. "Yes, you are right. Issue a mission in the mercenary agency to arrange a search party. Also, please send a letter to my father about what happened here. He'll help you find my brother."Ciaran nodded, "I have already taken care of the mission milady and sent a messenger pigeon to Lord Baron as well. We'll get Lord's response in a week."Jennifer showed a joyful expression. "Thank you. I'll remember your favor.""Please don't jest, it's something I should do. I'll take my leave now, please rest easy, my lady. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask." Ciaran bow slightly before he left the room.The moment Ciaran left the room, Jennifer's pitiful expression suddenly turned cold, and her lips curled upward.'It seemed those people aren't simple to even arrange a wolf king to get rid of my brother. The title of Baron will be mine as long as I do what they say!'Ciaran appeared in the hall with an exhausted face, without knowing about Jennifer's hidden motives.At this moment, an old man with gray hair and wearing butler clothes appeared. He bowed slightly and said, "My lord, I have something interesting to report."Ciaran smiled seeing the old man and said, "Uncle Harland, how many times do I have told you that you didn't need to act courteously when we're alone?"Harland smiled and merely said, "Please don't. I'm merely a servant of the house, Taran. I don't deserve such a privilege."Ciaran smiled wryly, "You're as stubborn as my father when it comes to manners, aren't you? Please tell me the important report?"Harland said, "My lord, I just received the news that a new C Rank Mercenary has appeared in our town!"Ciaran's expression suddenly changed and quickly asked, "Are you sure? Is he from our town?"Ciaran knew if this C Rank mercenary was a resident of rain town, he didn't need to worry about backlash from Baron because no one would be foolish enough to move against a hometown of C Rank mercenary.At least not a baron-ranked noble!Harland replied, "We don't know yet, but according to our sources his appearance is new, and he just recently appeared in our town and rent a house at the town's edge. Not only that, he seemed to be extremely mysterious because he only used one move to achieve the C Rank."I'm afraid some people might make a move, especially the Golden Claw Team Leader. That fellow is quite cunning and won't let such a person roam free on his turf." Ciaran's expression turn somewhat ugly when he heard the last sentence and couldn't help but gnashed his teeth, "That ungrateful scum has forgotten the benefits he received from us, and now he didn't even give me face after becoming famous."I want you to approach this new C Rank Mercenary personally before that scum had the chance and offer our congratulation gift and invite him to our house, Taran. As long as he agreed to give us his protection, anything is open for negotiation."If he didn't agree, don't push the topic, just form a good relationship with him. We had already tried controlling a C Rank mercenary and look, we only bought up a snake in our backyard."Harland sighed as he remembered the past and nodded, "I'll deal with it personally. Don't worry, my lord. But that mercenary is quite something. It appeared he took a C Rank mission right after receiving his license and left the town. Now no one could approach him until he gets back."Ciaran frowned, "Then keep an eye on his return and make a move instantly. I don't think that arrogant prick would resist the allure of hunting a wolf king and wait for him!"

Chapter 59 Visiting The Blacksmith
﻿While the news of a new C Rank Mercenary continued to spread in the Rain Town and some closer powers to it.The person in question who cause this big ripple was cooking leisurely.Jacob had indeed taken a hunting mission and left the town, but it was only because he wanted others to believe this and won't bother him.Although C Rank wasn't much, they were still respected figures by humans, and he knew if he wanted to avoid those annoying figures; he had to leave this place in their eyes.It was extremely easy to sneak back with his speed, and no one would bother him anymore.He wasn't planning to show himself until he was done absorbing the two heart essences he had prepared. It won't be too late to go on hunting to collect more heart essence at that time.Furthermore, Jacob had seen the wolf king hunting request in the C Rank Missions, and he could guess Jennifer had returned alive since only she managed to escape that day.Only she could report this back, and he wasn't worried at all because only bones would be left of the wolf king right now.He had already got the most of it and wasn't interested in that reward that would put him in the spotlight, just the C Rank fame was enough for him.Time passed, and in a flash, it was the night of the third day since Jacob has become a C rank mercenary.Right at this moment, the door of Isaac Smithery was pushed open and Jacob entered the familiar interior.Isaac was hammering an iron plate with a sweated face when he heard the doorbell and saw Jacob.Isaac smiled as he put the hammer down and said, "You're finally here. I almost thought you have forgotten our meeting."Jacob was training and eating for these past two days in his house and only leave secretly at this hour since it would reveal his whereabouts to others. He had already noticed some people loitering around his house in these two days, so he was even more vigilant to show himself."Heh, some flies delay me. Are my things ready?" Jacob chuckled. Isaac didn't take Jacob's word seriously and headed toward the backdoor and shortly after returned with a big box in his hand.He put the box in front of Jacob and said, "You can check them."Jacob didn't stand on ceremony and opened the box. He saw the shining steel parts of the distillation equipment. After examining them, he found nothing out of the place and nodded in satisfaction.He handed the reaming five silver coins to Isaac and said, "Good work."Isaac smile contently and received the silver before he asked, "Do you want to forge anything else?"He clearly remembered Jacob had said he would give more orders if he liked his work, and he looked forward to Jacob's designs. They were unique and exquisite.Jacob looked meaningfully at Isaac, 'Although he could forge this with ordinary steel, for the parts of a gun it won't be enough, and I don't know if this town had ordnance steel or something like it.'That colt rifle was made from something like carbon steel, which causes its fragility. I still knew nothing about the natural minerals of this world, nor did they have any books.'Jacob asked Isaac, "If you want to forge for me, I have to know; what is the strongest metal you have and what is its melting point?"Isaac was surprised by Jacob's question and answered, "I have around ten KG of Graphite Steel. As for its melting point, it's around 4,000 to 4,500 Degree Celsius. But it's quite expensive if you want to use it to forge."Jacob's eyes lit up, 'This will do!'"How expensive?" He asked.Isaac replied, "1 Gram of Graphite Steel for 2 Silver Coins, and I'll charge 1 Gold Coin for my service."'It's indeed expensive, but I have coins to spare. If I can change some parts of the revolver and new bullets to make it deadlier and change the skeleton of the colt rifle and its bullets, it should be enough for a while. As for creating model guns, I need my lab, which I can't have at this moment.'Jacob picked up the notebook and drew parts he needed to further increased his two firearms.Isaac was also absorbed in those small exquisite parts, Jacob was drawing with significant details.After drawing, Jacob gave it to Isaac and explain, "Forge everything with Graphite Steel except these shells and heads, use bronze and carbon for casing and head."Isaac looked at the bullet designs and exclaimed, "Isn't that ammo? You know how to create firearms?"Jacob smiled, "I just know how to create ammunition, as for other parts they're for something else. So, how is it can you create these small bullets?"Isaac was shocked this time because he knew those gunsmiths that can create ammunition weren't something a small blacksmith like him could compare with, and Jacob's identity became even more mysterious in his eyes at this moment.He said in embarrassment, "Sir, these bullet parts are really quite difficult to create, but as long as I can create a mold, it wouldn't be difficult. But I'm afraid it would take me more time to create them."Jacob coolly replied, "I'll draw you these two mold designs as well, but you have to give the first two molds to me for free, and you have to give me a 40% discount on bullet parts and those mold designs would be yours to use how however you wish."Isaac was shocked because he understood those bullet molds were even more precious and with them, he could have an endless bullet stream, which he could sell to the mercenary guild and increase his business to an unimaginable height."We have a deal!"He agreed without any hesitation because Jacob's bullets looked far more precious than normal bullets, so paying this small price was nothing!

Chapter 60 At 9.9%
﻿After finalizing his deal with Isaac, Jacob sneakily returned to his house with the box full of distillation equipmentNow the question was where he was going to assemble them, and he still didn't forget about how he got spotted because of that smoke.Although he was in a human settlement now and there wasn't any problem with the smoke, he wasn't supposed to be in his house right at this moment and if anyone found out, he was there it would be cumbersome.Nevertheless, Jacob still decided to just assemble it in his backyard which wasn't in other's view and there was only the town wall a few tens of meters away from it and as long as no one sneaked in that place they won't be able to see the smoke in the night.It took him half an hour to assemble the distillation equipment, and it wasn't too big or small; it was just right for his need.Thereupon, he put the dry woods he collected the other day in the furnace and then took out the metal box with arrow tail jaguar heart and blood in it.He chose to first absorbed the uncommon animal heart essence because he was afraid if he first absorbed the wolf king's heart essence, which was a rare beast, he would get fewer benefits.He still didn't know if it would affect his progress to absorb strong species heart essence or not, and how much he needed to reach 100%. But according to Immortika, he didn't need to worry about not getting the effect of any new species' heart essence.As long as he absorbed the heart essence of new species, he'll indefinitely progress and the only difference was in the tires of species. The higher the tire of a species was, the faster he'll progress.After closing the lid and making sure that everything was in order, enter the house again and waited like before, and he was also keeping an eye on any intruder or some curious prick.However, in eight hours, nothing out of ordinary happened and the distillation process went smoothly without a hitch.Sun was also rising, so he covered the equipment with an old cloth and returned inside with an iron beaker filled with crystalline heart essence.He took out the same metal syringe he used for his first injection. He was lucky to keep it inside his pendant, or it would be another problem to find another one like this in this place.Jacob was in the basement right now where Pig Head was hiding, and he also chose this place because if anyone intruded, Pig Head could handle them as long as they weren't above B Rank Mercenary.After giving the order to Pig Head, he sat bare chest and took a deep breath before he pierced that syringe in his heart.Not only he didn't feel any excessive pain like before but as the arrow tail jaguar's heart essence quickly get absorbed in his heart and a cold sensation ran all over his veins.He didn't lose his consciousness and remain static while he felt that cold sensation all over his body and his wildly beating heart.On the inner wall of Jacob's mutated heart, the dark mark stirred, which had appeared after the carcass of Bloodstorming Bug merged with his heart. The dark mark was becoming more and more apparent and talking a shape, but it was still too vague.This was the Immortal Mark, which was now becoming the Cursed Mark, according to the second level of the cursed heart emergence.This process continued for two hours before Jacob felt that sensation vanish, and he knew the entire heart essence was absorbed. But he could tell the change brought by this heart essence wasn't as apparent as the last time."Is this the difference between rare and uncommon species' heart essence? Although my strength has increased, it's subtle." Jacob mumbled.Nevertheless, Jacob stood up from his spot and headed toward his small kitchen, since he felt hungry after this injection. He had already bought supplies, which would last him a few days.But they weren't nutritious since the meat was from common animals, but they taste alright.Afterward, Jacob again started to sharpen his fighting styles and get used to his increased strength until the night was upon him.He bathed before starting the distillation process again.Just like yesterday, he waited all night for the heart essence and then injected it into the basement.However, this time, Jacob felt slightly pained when the dark wolf king's heart essence entered his body. But it wasn't unbearable that he couldn't handle.Furthermore, he suddenly felt a large amount of sweat releasing from his pores and his hair grew at a fast pace like before.This time it took him ten hours for this absorption before his eyes amber eyes opened with a ghastly glint present deep within them.'This wolf king was stronger than Decker and I could feel my body reached some kind of wall,' Jacob mused, and the very next moment he thought, "Cursed Immortality!"He quickly looked at the progress of the second level, and he was astonished._______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 9.99%…_______"Only 0.1% away from the 10%. Afterward, I would have to again eat like a lunatic to match my body with my heart. Well, it's not like I'm complaining." Jacob's lips curled upward.Although it was only his guess, but he presumed if he hit that pillar with his full strength, it would show 1500 KG punching force. But he was still far away from matching an A Rank Mercenary.Nevertheless, he knew as long as he continued to absorb the heart essence, A rank wasn't far, and he looked forward to it.At this moment, the scripture's writing changed and Jacob knew who it was, and he frowned."Your luck is not bad. It seemed you might awake an ability at the 100% of the second level!"
