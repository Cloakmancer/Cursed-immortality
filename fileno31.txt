Chapter 31 I’m Already Cursed
﻿Jacob controlled his urge to vomit everything out. He knew if he did, he might have to butcher someone in this room.Drinking a mixture of bone marrow was far better than eating some humanoid monster. He wasn't ready for this.Jacob somehow reached the wooden chair and sat down. He was feeling a freezing sensation in his stomach, and it was slowly reaching every part of his body. He could even hear his extremely fast heartbeat. Furthermore, the deadly hunger was finally decreasing, and, for some reason, he was enjoying the cold sensation as his eyes started to turn drowsy. He just wanted to sleep all of a sudden despite just waking up, and in the end, he fell into a deep sleep on the chair in that, comfortable feeling.At this moment, abruptly, hair grew on Jacob's bald head at an astronomical pace, while his bony body, which looked like a dry skeleton, started to slowly bulk.The transformation has begun!---After some unknown time,Jacob's eyelids trembled slightly before he slowly opened his eyes, filled with confusion as he quickly remembered he fell into sudden sleep out of the blue."My hunger has really reduced to a bearable degree, but it's still there. I can feel it, and according to that cursed book, it will only last a few weeks before it will come back even stronger…" Jacob mumbled helplessly.Suddenly, Jacob's eyes landed on his hands, and he was astonished because his bonny hands were long gone, and mass had already appeared.Although it was only a minimum, the change was obvious. His skin has also turned pale from yellowish.Jacob quickly stood up with a hint of excitement, and suddenly he felt silk-like threads feel on his shoulder.He couldn't help but touch the silky threads. "My hair has grown so big?"Jacob was astonished, and when he saw his long hair, which had reached his shoulder, it was completely silver-white."An unusual color," Jacob mumbled.He quickly stood in front of the glass cell and saw his vague reflection. He was shocked because before, he was bony, and now he was skinny. Although it was a small change, however, for Jacob, it was quite obvious.Furthermore, his previous 1.6-meter height had also changed. He was now 1.7 meters tall and could feel much stronger than his previous weak self."This is only the result of a twenty percent transformation, and as I inject heart blood, the transformation will continue. Doesn't this mean I can become strong just by eating and sleeping?"Jacob's heartbeat raised suddenly just thinking about it, and he felt it was all worth it!Suddenly, his ears twitched slightly as he heard a heartbeat from behind.'My hearing has also grown!' Jacob was thrilled because he knew human hearing couldn't be this strong. 'This is truly magical!'Jacob quickly calmed down and mused,'Although my change is quite great and unnatural, I have to keep eating high-grade nutrition, or that hunger will come back stronger. I have to leave this place as soon as possible. Since this base is in some forest, there might be animals I can hunt with Pig-Head's strength. But this guy is strange. He didn't have any heartbeat like he was dead. This world is just too damn strange.'Well, I don't care as long as I can use him. It's far better than eating him. This guy is like a strong killing machine; using him properly will bode significant results. But I have to deal with those traps set by that blind shit, and only he knew the safe passage.'Jacob's eyes turned cold as he turned around and looked toward Decker's cell, filled with light blue liquid, which almost turned transparent.He knew Decker was the key if he wanted to go outside, and he couldn't let Pig Head waste his strength just to cross some traps. It would affect his plans."I know you're awake. Let's have another chat." Jacob said impassively.He could now feel the slightest change in Decker's heartbeat, just like Decker before.Jacob released Decker, who remained stoic."You can speak freely." Jacob again sat in his chair.Decker said in his husky voice, "Just give up, human. I will never tell you anything!""How stubborn." Jacob chuckled coldly, "But I already know about you, 'Decker Shaw!"Decker's expression finally changed when he heard his full name. He quickly guessed Jacob had already got his hands on his hidden journal, which also meant he got the treasure book he stole right under the giants!"Bastard… Bastard… cursed you!" He started to utter in a mad frenzy.How could he endure when the fruit of his labor was eaten by the other?He was now the enemy of a rarer race just because of that book, but now it would benefit someone else while he took all the blame and hate!Jacob was quite pleased with Decker's expressions and said coldly, "Just give up and tell me everything I want to know, and I might leave you alone. What do you think?"Although he got some information from Decker's journal, it wasn't enough and was too vague.Decker was a veteran who had managed to pull the wool on the giants' eyes and escaped alive, and he could still get his hands on all those materials and advanced equipment, despite the giants on his tail.This alone proved his survival abilities and contacts, and Jacob wanted that all!However, Decker madly replied, his voice full of hatred,"You can go fuck yourself, your thievish bastard… you took everything from me. I was so close… so close… b-but you human ruined it all. I'll curse; you'll die in the same way as me, full of despair and bitterness!"Jacob sighed heavenly, and his expression turned extremely icy as he said, with no hint of emotions,"I'm afraid I'm already cursed…"

Chapter 32 Opening The Door! (1)
﻿"Die… Die… Die…" Decker had lost his mind after he found out Jacob had got his everything, even his precious life work."Shut up."Jacob was irritated by Decker's maniacal behavior, and he knew Decker was a hopeless case and he was on his own. But he still had Decker's journal and only read a fraction. He might find something useful, and he also had two new books, which were even more helpful than Decker's journal.Decker's stoic face appeared again after Jacob made him shut up, but his thoughts were in a mess and despair.Jacob looked at Pig Head, who seemed somewhat drained. He finally remembered he had forgotten to put him in that blue liquid, or he didn't let him drink it."Pig Head, go drink two buckets of blue liquid." He also understood why Decker gave such a command to Pig Head.'It seems Pig Head's body is somehow special. Although he didn't have a heartbeat or breathing, he could understand and observe fine. I have to look into it after I get a chance,' Jacob mused.However, his expression changed when he saw Pig Head draw a bucket of extremely light blue liquid, almost transparent!He knew something was amiss and quickly strode there. When he looked into the well, his heart turned cold because he could see the bottom, and from his estimate, only five gallons worth of liquid was left, but it was almost transparent.The well was fifteen cubic meters in diameter and twenty-meter-deep. It was divided into three portions of five meters with a metallic wall.He quickly opened the next lid, saw the green liquid, and sighed in relief because it was more than half filled, and he couldn't see the bottom of it, and it still didn't lose its color.As for the last portion, it was only four to five meters filled with dark liquid."The Blue liquid is about to end, while the green one is still more than half full, and the black one is the most potent one of all of them. I can't use them recklessly anymore, and Pig Head needed them to sustain himself. Fuck, one problem after another!" Jacob cursed under his breath.He had almost forgotten Decker was using these liquids for god knows when, and they were something exhaustible.Blue was the weakest of these three liquids, followed by green and then black.He could see a large hole at the bottom in the blue liquid portion, and he knew the liquid entered the cells from there and again exited back.He even felt nauseated when he thought about how this liquid was used again and again while everyone was soaking in it."Let's just hope I won't need to enter that cell anymore." Jacob sighed bitterly.Pig Head was also done with his 'meal' and finally started recovering."This blue liquid could only last a week, and then I have to let him drink the green one, which might take a year or two to finish. Which means I have to leave this place within two or three years!" Jacob quickly calculated, "But first, I have to reach the outside and then think further after seeing just how deep we're in the forest."Jacob nodded and commanded, "Pig Head, carry him and follow me."Pig Head grabbed Decker's head from his palm, picked him up like some rage doll, and followed Jacob, who was making his way toward the staircase.'I'm finally going out…'Jacob felt a little bit of excitement and reminiscence when he thought about how he was reincarnated and opened his eye in this room and experienced hell before finally turning things around and even getting a cursed book that promise him immortality…'It all just like a bad yet pleasing dream.' He sighed as he ascended the stairs barefoot.He was still wearing a cape and wrapping another cape around his waist.Decker's boots were too short for him, and he also didn't have any clothes of his size, so he could only do with this for now.Jacob finally reached the steel door, put his hand on the handle, and breathed deeply before he twisted it open!A creaking sound rang in the deadly silence when the door was opened inwardly.A pitch-black corridor appeared, which looked bottomless abyss.Jacob had already carried a small lamp that Decker had bought. It was lit in white light.The pathway was almost illuminated, but Jacob still didn't see the end of it."Just which shithole did you dig this room in?" Jacob couldn't help but exclaim, "Put him here."Pig Head does as he said and puts stoic Decker right on the doorstep's center."Oh, stubborn little shit, just like before, listen carefully; you're standing in the center of the hidden room's door, and we're standing right at the pathway's edge, which leads to the outside. Start walking on the safe route!"Jacob knows Decker can't control his thoughts, not right now, since he had suffered a huge mental blow.Decker took a step and slowly walked."Follow his every footstep, and if he stopped, then stop." He ordered Pig Head as he handed the lamp to him as well.Pig Head followed suit, and Jacob followed right behind Pig Head's footsteps.Decker walked straight without changing directions, and Jacob carefully observed the surroundings.'This was an underground cave naturally formed, and Decker chose this as his hidden base. I have to admit. This is an ideal place if someone wants to hide,' Jacob felt glorified.In the end, no trap came their way as Decker finally reached the end. There was a stone wall.Jacob frowned. 'Could it be there aren't any traps? But how could it be this guy would not compromise his safety?He saw Decker move toward the right side of the wall and crouch down.Jacob's eyes finally landed on a small stone lever at the right corner of the stone wall!

Chapter 33 Opening The Door! (2)
﻿However, Jacob's expression changed when he saw Decker's hand tremble when he touched the stone lever.He barked, "Stop him!"With his big hand, Pig Head instantly reacted and pulled Decker back from his head and nearly crashed it.Jacob sighed in relief and uttered coldly, "I knew something was not right since you didn't try to put any resistance, just like last time. So, that lever is the trap, or it's a trap, as well as the key to opening this door. Since you're able to reach it so easily, this also confirmed my theory, and when you wanted to trigger the trap, the parasite gem stopped you. Heh, you're a schemer, little Deck. Just speak and let it out."Decker's stoic expression turned into a maniac, and he roared, "Human, no matter what, you can never leave this place and die, die, die… when all those Nutrition Liquids run out, you will die here… hahaha… die."Jacob sighed. He knew very well how it felt if someone stole your hard work right under your nose and then profited from that work big time.Furthermore, Decker had not only lost his life works to Jacob, but he also lost a journal that guaranteed immortality. This kind of hatred was nothing compared to anything. It was far deeper than killing one father or mother.That's why Decker will do anything to kill Jacob, even if it costs him his life. It will all be worth it if he can take Jacob down with him!"You're an idiot. Since you give me clues, this is enough for me to figure it out. Let me see." Jacob's eyes were glued to Decker's twisted face.He said, "Since it's a lever, it can move up or down or even can be turned around, and you try to move it, which means it would be a disaster if I try to move it, right?"Decker's right eye twitched slightly at this moment, and Jacob's smile widened."So, I only have two options now, either put it out or push it inside like a button, and I know someone like you makes it even trickier, so let's go with the first option!"Decker's expression finally changed, and he barked madly, "You bastard! How did you find out!? Just why can't you die?!"It was just as Jacob described. Decker had set this lever up as a gigantic trap, and he knew anyone would try to move it, and it would be their doom at that time.He even calculated that anyone who can reach this place will be someone from the inside and want to escape, so their mind would be in a mess and all they could think about would be freedom, and this would greatly raise their chances of triggering the trap!But Jacob saw through it, and how could he not? He was someone in the weapon business, and traps were also a part of the weapon industry for a long time.How could this measly mind trap fool Jacob, who can make a trap far deadlier than this!"I said you're an idiot, so act like one. There's no need for you to play smart. You can never escape my grasp!" said Jacob coldly.He spun around and walked back to the staircase and put the metal door in front of him, and after making sure he was completely covered, he shouted, "Pig Head, pull that stone lever out!"Bam…Thereupon, he slammed the door shut. Although he was confident in this theory, he won't be so brave as to confirm it himself when he had two meat shields.However, nothing happened after waiting for a while, and the cave remained silent. Jacob smiled in victory, opened the door, and reached Pig Head and Decker's position again.He saw a crack had appeared right in the center of that stone wall, and he said with a hint of anticipation, "Little Deck, if it's safe to open the wall, then move, and if it isn't, then remain still!"Decker's expression filled with despair and unwillingness, but he was helpless, and his leg moved as he cursed Jacob, "Bastard human, you'll die when just you wait!""We have to see about it." Jacob chuckled coldly and completely ignored Decker's curses and said to Pig Head, "Open it." Pig Head pushed the stone wall, and with the slightest effort, it was completely opened outward like two stone doors.Jacob finally saw just ten meters away, a stone ladder was going upward, and his heart was filled with ecstasy, but he didn't make any rash move.He again looked at Decker and said with a smile, "Little Deck, there's a stone ladder. If it's safe, move, and if there are traps, remain standing."Decker's entire body trembled as if he wanted to move, but he wasn't strong enough to overpower the parasite gem."Heh, stop, it just started, and I'm looking forward to more information." Jacob chucked in a mocking tone, which made Decker even madder."Tell me if the stone ladder is the trap. If yes, move, and if no, remain standing…"Is the floor have any trap door, if…"Does a weight-trap…"Is step number three safe…"Is step number nine…"Is there a stone door or anything hiding the exit…"Any sense type trap…"Decker felt like his mind was spinning. Jacob had asked so many questions about traps. Actually, he had never heard about some of them, and he suddenly remembered what Jacob had told him when they spoke the first time.'Could he be a… reincarnated person…'An icy chill ran down Decker's spine with just the thought of it. But he quickly threw that thought away from his head because it was just too unrealistic.But he couldn't suppress it completely because Jacob was just too sharp for a weak human, and he could easily see through a veteran like him despite his young age.Only someone who had gone through all these experiences could know this much and know how to deal with it, and Jacob was just too much of an anomaly!

Chapter 34 Opening The Door! (3)
﻿Deep inside lush woods, The Mossy Forest Floor suddenly trembled before a square crack appeared, and it lifted in the air before it the air and then thrown to the side, and a three-square meter deep dark hole appeared in the mossy floor.Thereupon, a Pig Head suddenly popped up from the dark hole, followed by its humanoid burly body, and after him appeared a skinny youth with a face full of ecstasy.The youth looked around with great curiosity and took deep breaths.He sighed and said, "I'm finally out, hahaha!"His voice was filled with thriller and relief. This youth was obviously Jacob.After his long interrogation process, he could finally find the actual and safe passage outside.Jacob looked down and felt the soft yet wet mossy floor. A delightful cold sensation was running all over his feet. He looked around and saw the hidden passage was completely surrounded by towering trees, and it was extremely hard to tell there was a hidden cave there.He mumbled, "That bastard really knows how to choose a hiding spot. No one could tell this part of the ground was a hoax, and underneath it was a whole cave. Even if they find it, they would be quite lucky if they were able to escape those traps."Jacob really admired Decker's work and his meticulous way of doing things.He looked up and saw the large crowns of trees had completely covered the sunlight, and only some beams of yellow light were visible."The air here is quite chilly, and according to Decker's journal, this place is called Rainy Mountain Ranges, which means I'm in the middle of nowhere, and I don't have a map nor that bastard left any clues about this place."If rain is common here, then I can't wander around aimlessly, or I might lose my way. Since I now know how to exit the hidden base, I should first read those two books, and there isn't any hurry as well. As for my hunger problem…"Jacob's eyes shimmered with coldness and resolved when he thought at this point. He knew he had to get his hand dirty if he wanted to survive and archive immortality.'I won't have to suppress my demon anymore…' A ferocious glint flashed past Jacob's eyes as he looked at the dark hole."Let's go back." He said to Pig Head and entered the hole again.After they both enter the hidden base again, Jacob carefully closes the passage again and goes back to his room with listless Decker.After Jacob gained all the information with his words game, Decker knew it was meaningless to struggle, and he was just waiting for his death.He had completely given up on resistance, but if Jacob asked him about his experience or information, he would still stubbornly refuse because it would make things less difficult for Jacob!Albeit, he'll die. He would make sure Jacob's journey throughout the Rainy Mountain Ranges cannot be easy because he knew just how dangerous this mountain range was if someone didn't know the safe routes or if they were someone as weak as a human.Jacob locked Decker in a glass cell again, used the depleted blue nutrition liquid, and left Pig Head to rest in his own cell while using a green nutrition liquid.After this short trip, he clearly understood just how important Pig Head was to him, and without him, he might've become Decker's suicidal attempt victim.That's why he decided to use the higher-grade liquid this time, and he knew this liquid was special since it also transformed into a hibernation liquid after its healing effect from exhaustion."Now, I should start memorizing the contents of those two books as soon as possible, and I should start with Advance Herbology of Rare and Rarer Plants & Plant Lore since I'm in a forest and plants can be more dangerous than animals if you don't know it's poisonous or not."These mountain ranges are between the boundary of uncommon and rare races regions, which means there won't be any rarer type plants here, and even if there are, the chances are extremely low."Jacob mused before he took the Advance Herbology of Rare and Rarer Plants & Plant Lore, which wasn't six inches thick, and engrossed himself in it.Before long, Jacob was completely immersed in that book with a fascinated look on his face. Although he wasn't a botanist, he had researched many herbs because of his obsession.This book was filled with inoffensive and toxic plants. The more Jacob read, the more he felt these plants were really terrified."Iron Pike Vine: rare rank."Danger Level: High"Ability: Able to penetrate iron with its pike-like iron vines."Weakness: Water"Smoky Flower: uncommon rank."Danger Level: intermediate"Ability: produce a white smoke-like flora in the air which is highly hallucinating. Its range is one meter."Weakness: Water and Fire"Blue Pine Tree….Jacob read one after one plant's information, and he was somewhat shocked because his memory was quite good, and he only needed to read the information three or four times before he completely memorized it word by word."Is it also the effect of my new heart?" Jacob was quite happy and continued to read.Just like that, an unknown time passed, and Jacob remained engrossed in his reading.Jacob also noticed the special traits of his new body.Foremost, he can awake for a very long time. Although he didn't know the exact duration, he knew it would be around three or four days.Second, he only needed one hour of sleep to recover his exhausted mental strength.Third, one jerky lasted for three days before he felt his hunger reaching his bearable limit. However, he could feel the duration was getting lower and lower, and he would soon meet the deadline of the second deadly hunger attack.So, to ensure it won't happen, he began preparing himself…Prepared to unleash the… demon!

Chapter 35 You’re A Devil!
﻿On this day,Outside the hidden cave room, just below the stone ladder leading to the outside forest, Jacob could be seen assembling a metal structure made with different scrap parts.There was a large container with a lid with a slim long-twisted metal tube attached to it, and another container connected to the other end of this metal tube.Furthermore, there was a large collection of different dry woods on the other side.Jacob was naturally prepared to collect his first heart essence with a distillation process described by cursed immortality.Although his crude self-created equipment for the distillation process can't be compared with the modern technology of his world, they were enough to serve their purpose.As for who was going to become his first target for heart and blood, it will Decker.Firstly, Jacob had a deep grudge against Decker for what he did. Second, Decker was from a rare race, which makes his heart essence more potent than any uncommon specie.Third, he didn't know just what animals resided in this vast mountain range, and he didn't feel secure going out hunting while constantly being afraid of his hunger and the unknown when he had a source beside him.Fourth, he knows as long as his body can become strong enough to sustain his heart, he'll get superhuman strength, and by taking this first step, he'll get stronger.Lastly, the resources in Decker's hideout were limited, and Decker was no longer useful besides his information value, and he was only burning those precious color liquids, so it was best to get rid of him. Furthermore, Jacob didn't want to torture Decker anymore. He was afraid Decker might lose his nutritional value.As for his intricacy with killing, Jacob had long prepared himself for this since he couldn't live without killing in this world which was just too damn cruel, and if he still didn't use his 'inner talent,' he could just forget about living here and obtain immortality!After Jacob made crude distillation equipment with the change of a furnace-type reboiler since he needed at least 1000 Celsius.Decker's secret hideout was a lab, and he found some equipment he could use to make this crude setup easily there, which saved him from a lot of trouble.After making sure that it was airtight and testing it once, he nodded in satisfaction before making his way back toward where Decker was held."My hunger is becoming worse and worse, and I only have two or three days before it reaches its peak. I need to start today." Jacob mumbled as he opened the door of the secret room.There wasn't any change in the room. Only the table had been modified.There were two holes on each side of the table's center edges, they were connected with another two metal tubes, and two containers were below them.Furthermore, deep carvings on the table edges formed a pathway leading to the two holds.Jacob had carefully crafted this table to collect flowing blood without wasting it. His forging skills and advanced knowledge were coming in handy.Besides the table, there wasn't any change here. Decker had been floating in green liquid for a week now, and Pig Head as well after collecting all those woods.Jacob stood in front of Decker's glass cell and calmly looked at him for a long time as if he was readying himself for what he was about to do.'Sigh…'Jacob sighed softly before he emptied the glass cell, and dripping Decker appeared."Do you know what I'm about to do?" Jacob coolly asked as he had unrestrained Decker's mouth."Heh, does it matter?" Decker sneered coldly.Although he didn't know what Jacob was about to do with him this time, he was ready for anything."You're an annoying bastard, do you know that?" Jacob scoffed. "Follow me and lay down to your favorite table where you killed lord knows how many."Decker coldly chucked as he followed Jacob's lead and slowly lay down at the center of the new table with lots of deep cravings."What, are you finally going to torture me? Just don't disappoint me." Decker coolly said as he showed his beastly teeth.Jacob chuckled coldly, "As much as I want to, it might damage my premium quality rare meat, so you're going off easily."Decker's expression finally changed as he said with disbelief, "You want to… eat me?!"Jacob coolly replied, "Well, it's not like I have any other choice, besides I had read in Rare and Rarer Beast Encyclopedia that rare Goblin Wolf is quite a delicacy on the mainland, and it's directly related to your goblin race, so it made me quite curious about what an Imp Goblin taste like?"Decker felt a chill run down his spine as Jacob's voice sounded like the devil, "You bastard dare to compare me with livestock?! Are you not afraid of retribution after thinking about eating an intelligent life form?! Even I won't stoop to such a level!"Jacob merely chucked and said, "I already said I have no choice now. Either I eat you or risk my life out there and even die from hunger. Besides, as long as it's not a fellow human. In my eyes, you are an intelligent camel that can be slaughtered in need of water or its meat."Decker felt Jacob's voice was exempt from any emotions and suddenly felt a cold sensation gripping his wrist as Jacob's devil-like voice sounded again,"Although I never killed any human in my life before, it doesn't mean I never slaughter animals to suppress my urge to kill. Don't worry. You'll die of blood loss without any pain or suffering."Jacob slightly rubbed Decker's wrists with a strange, twisted smile on his face."I know every signal nerve in the human body, and your body isn't much different from a human as well. It's just that I don't know if I would become addicted to it… oh well, I don't care anymore…"Just as Jacob's icy voice faded, he picked up the scalpel-like knife he had ready beforehand."You'll die like me… you'll be eaten alive in these mountains… not even your bones will be left…" Decker started to curse manically, as he couldn't resist or move his body.Although Decker wasn't afraid of death, he was afraid of being eaten by his enemy. Just the thought of it gave him endless nauseous and hate. He never thought Jacob would be so cruel.Jacob said with a hint of mockery, "This is the exact reason I'm doing it, and you can only blame yourself for this. As for being eaten alive by others, I don't know about that, but you, on the hand, will be going to turn into a nice stew tonight."Jacob carefully made a deep cut on Decker's wrist as red blood gushed out and placed it right above the hole.As Jacob made the cut, knowing that he was about to kill Decker, he felt a delightful chill over his body, making his fine hair stand and tremble in excitement as he breathed heavily."Don't move!"Jacob said as he saw Decker was again trying to struggle, but he didn't care since, at any rate, he'll die today in this way or another.He moved toward Decker's other wrist and again made another deep cut on his wrist and placed it carefully on the hole. He looked exactly like a serial killer who had done this before many times with an exact, twisted, satisfied smile on his face."Bastard, you'll never escape the retribution. One day, someone else will do even worse to you…"Decker continued to curse as he felt his body and mind going numb. He knew today was the day he'll die and become someone's dinner, which made him resentful. But alas, there wasn't anything he could do.Jacob completely ignored Decker's curses and calmly sat on the chair as he looked at Decker's flowing blood in the container with a hint of elation.Little by little, the containers started to fill with Decker's blood, and Decker's voice was becoming vaguer and vaguer.After ten minutes, Decker was on the verge of losing consciousness as he kept mumbling."Y… Y-you're… a… devil…"A minute passed, and Decker's voice completely faded at this moment as his blood flow was also slowing down a lot.Jacob finally closed his eyes as he remembered those last words of Decker and felt deep satisfaction after knowing he had killed his most hated enemy with his hand.Jacob's eyes finally opened, and the darkness in them had completely faded away, and he exhaled. "Just as I thought, I felt nothing but excitement while killing him, and I already want to experience it again. If I continue, I can never stop myself…"Jacob smiled coldly the very next moment, "Anything to achieve my goal… now it's time to put you out of your misery."Jacob stood up again, and this time, he slit Decker's throat without hesitation, and more blood flowed on the table, making its way towards those two openings.With this, Decker, the first person Jacob saw after reincarnating, was finally dead at Jacob's hands!

Chapter 36 Extracting Heart Essence
﻿It was nighttime outside, and the sky seemed clean from any clouds.The ground door leading toward Decker's hideout was currently opened, and smoke rose from it like a chimney.On the underground floor,Crude equipment was set up, and the fire was lit underneath the metal container, which had been made into a crude furnace. The red smoke rose from it as the crimson liquid was boiling.Jacob stood there calmly observing as cursed immortality hovered in front of him.He said, "So, Immortika, should I throw the heart inside now and close it?"Jacob was very careful with this task of collecting heart essence. That was why he summoned the cursed immortality to seek its opinion on every single detail. He was also calling it 'Immortika' now since he didn't like always calling it cursed immortality.He wasn't a chemist in his past life, but he had some very rich experience working with chemicals and active elements because of his profession and research, which was why he was able to build this crude distillation equipment from scratch.Immortika replied in elated words, "Hehe, I never thought you would choose the little imp for your first target and abandon your morals so quickly. I'm impressed, and don't call me by that name. I'm Cursed Immortality!"Jacob replied in vexation, "IMMORTIKA… can't you just answer my question? Don't you say you can't answer anything besides questions related to the book?"Immortika replied, "Hehehe… I can't answer your question, but I didn't say I can't freely give my opinion on other unimportant things."As for the answer to your question, although that thing looked like it would explode at any time since it reached the sufficient temperature, I don't think there's a need to hesitate anymore. "Just throw the heart into it and start the distillation after thirty seconds. You only need 100-milliliter of heart essence, so it won't take long even if that thing ends up exploding… hehe."Jacob rolled his eyes, even though he knew the equipment was very unstable, and if he closed the lid, then it would become a bomb if it wasn't able to handle the pressure.In the end, he inhaled a warm breath, and the moment a warm bloody heart appeared in his from his infinity pendant.His infinity pendant can not only keep living things alive in it, but I can also keep things fresh, just like the moment they were stored in it, and it was perfect for storing food supplies. It's just that its space was too small for now.Jacob glanced at Decker's heart he extracted this afternoon, and sighed. "You change my heart once, and now I'm holding your heart… and we're both doing it for immortality. How lamentable."He threw the heart in the boiling blood and sealed the lid as smoke rose from the twisted metal tube and another tube.Jacob waited over thirty seconds before he closed the twisted tube into the second container he prepared for distillation and let the other tube open to release some build-up pressure.Jacob didn't stay close to it because if this thing exploded, he didn't want to be anywhere near it and enter the passage while closing the door.Immortika wrote at this moment, "Five hours should be sufficient if that thing can hold this long, that is."Jacob replied, "I know, but I also have confidence in something I built. It won't explode easily. Besides, the containers I used were all made of special materials from this world, and they were quite tough, so I won't think this much pressure could crack them up.""Heh, pity, I won't be here to see the result. But you must remember to inject that heart essence within six hours after its extraction or store it inside the infinity pendant, or it will lose its effect, and you will get fewer benefits."Jacob sighed and asked with some concern, "You sure with fifteen KG rare meat I got after slaughtering Decker and his heart essence, I'll be able to convert my body up to fifty percent? What about the hunger, or if that fellow was poisonous?"The writing changed,"Why are you fretting over it so much? Since you're unwilling to eat that guy's head, then it should help you about 45% to rebuild your body, and this tire-three heart essence will also convert your Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark up to 3% completion from 01% completion."As for your poison complaint, do you think you can be poisoned by a tier three species' meat after condensing a mutated immortal mark? Stop being a worrywart."Look at the bright side; your hunger problem will not be accrued for at least two years after this, and in the meantime, just hunt some other races outside there. It's time for you to leave this turtle shell. Let me see the liveliness of the outside world."Jacob scoffed, "You just wanted to see me kill others, right?""So, what if I am? Don't forget without sacrifices, there won't be any gains, and it's not like you don't enjoy it yourself. I'm a perfect fit for you, so stop rejecting and suppressing your impulses. It will only get you killed by others.""Heh, I'll do what I want. You're just a book, so act like one and vanish." Jacob sneered coldly before he closed the cursed immortality.He didn't want to read more of this book's sarcastic remarks and preaching about killing.Although it said nothing wrong, Jacob didn't want to be completely controlled and indulged in his inner impulses, or he would become a mindless killer.Even if he enjoyed that feeling, this doesn't change the fact that he had rich life experience and knew what kind of result these nefarious urges would bring."I could suppress it in my whole past life, so controlling it in this life should not be a problem for me, either…"

Chapter 37 Position Revealed!
﻿A couple of miles away from Decker's hideout in Rainy Mountain Ranges.It was already dawn, and the sky was turning bright, but dark clouds were also gathering over the mountain range.Inside a large cave,Two colossal figures were sitting around a bonfire while a large, unknown animal was currently skewered on top of the fire.These figures were at least 2.7 meters tall, even while sitting. One could only imagine their heights when they were standing."Brother Aaron, we've been searching for weeks in this vast mountain range, but we still didn't find any trace of that thievish goblin. Do you think that Bronze-Goblin is tricking us and wasting our time for the reward?" the person with a husky voice spoke with uncertainty.In reply, Aaron said in his heavy voice, "I don't think so, goblins race knows what happened to the Imp-Goblin tribe after their tribesman dared to double-cross us, so I don't think they would dare to try anything funny anymore despite their greedy and shrewd nature."As for this bronze goblin, I have already investigated him before following him here. He held some deep grudge against the Imp-Goblin tribe, so he didn't have any reason to court death, and he had some ability in tracking, so he's our best choice right now. At least it's far better than searching in the dark. Just keep your patient, Brother Montel."Montel sighed and said with a hint of hate in his husky voice, "It's not like I'm impatient, but I can't forget how that little thief made a fool of our race and stole something we work so hard to find, and our brethren sacrifice their lives to get. He even poisoned fifteen men to death, including my little brother. I would never rest until I skin that bastard alive!""I know how you feel, but you can't let your judgment be clouded by hate, or that bastard might escape…"Before Aaron could complete his sentence, he came to an abrupt stop as he coldly turned toward the entrance of the cave.These were not worried about any ambush since there weren't any creatures in this mountain range that could pose any threat to them.Montel also sensed something as he also narrowed his green eyes toward the entrance.At this moment, a cloaked figure of 1.4 meters in height could be seen running toward those two giants.Aaron sternly said at this moment, "You better have a good reason to disturb our meal, little ant!The cloaked person completely ignored those pairs of icy eyes and hastily said, "Milords, I think I found the hideout of that thievish imp!" Montel's large green eyes suddenly shimmered in a sharp glint as he blurted, "Where?!""Last morning, when I was scouting two miles in the east, I saw smoke rising from the far northeast, but it only remained for ten minutes, and before I could pinpoint the exact position, the smoke vanished because of the humidity here. All traces were gone." The cloaked person replied truthfully.Aaron cussed. "Are you certain this was the little bastard? It could be a hunter, and I don't think that astute little shit will make this kind of rookie mistake.""I also thought about it, but then there were a few hunters who wanted to come into these deep parts of the rainy mountain ranges where toxic beasts reside. Furthermore, just last night, when I was investigating the suspicious area, a strange smell suddenly appeared."After following that scent, I found its source, and it was coming from an underground hole! But I didn't dare to investigate the area around that hole. I was worried about traps or being found out, so I left a mark over there and came straight here to report."I think it's that imp bastard, and he might be doing some sort of experiment, but he never would've thought we were already here on his tail and overlooked this small detail, making a huge mistake on his own!" the cloaked person's voice was filled with coldness and ecstasy.A burst of booming, sharp laughter rang inside the cave at this moment. Montel laughed like a fiend as if Decker's neck was already in his hand.He blurted, "Led the way. Let me see where that bastard can run this time!"However, Aaron shook his big head and said calmly, "We should wait for the rain before moving toward that hideout. It still isn't confirmed if this hideout is that little bastard or not. We don't want to startle some old monster who's living here and doing his research."The cloaked person nodded in agreement, "Yes, we can hide our footsteps in the rain, and if there's some senior living there, we can pretend we lost our way and accidentally stumbled upon that area. Besides, I don't think anyone would dare to offend two lords, but it is still better to be assured."Montel's excited expression was also sour, hearing this, and fell silent. He can't retort to those two since they were talking about reasons.He said, "Fine. I'll let that bastard keep his insignificant life for some time more!" He finally settled down.Aaron nodded in satisfaction and looked toward the cloaked person. "You go there and keep a watch from afar. If there's any movement, don't engage. Observe. The moment the rain starts, come and get us as well. There's not any gap for failure this time, or you can also forget about your life."The cloaked person trembled slightly hearing that cold voice and quickly said before leaving, "I-I understand. Please rest assured I'll do this task carefully!"Aaron watched the cloaked person leave the cave and said to Montel, "I told you to be patient and see. We have already received the good news. I hope it was that bastard, not some old eccentric."Montel scoffed coldly and said, "Heh, don't worry. Even if it were an old eccentric, he would not dare to offend our Mountain Giant Race!"

Chapter 38 Improvements (1)
﻿Four hours before, Decker's hideout was reported."Heh, it didn't blow up, after all. Let's reap the rewards!" Jacob mumbled in ecstasy as the wait was finally over.He closed the book in his hand, calmly opened the pathway's door, and saw that his crude equipment was intact.Without further delay, he quickly extinguished the fire, moved toward the collecting container, and opened the lid.A cloud of light red smoke escaped the moment the lid was removed, and a potent smell attacked Jacob's nostrils, making him cough."Fuck, it better not be as bad as it smells…" Jacob mumbled with a noxious expression.After the smoke cleared, Jacob finally saw the crystal red liquid on the bottom.'It should be slightly more than 150ml,' Jacob mused as he looked toward the slightly lit outer door space."Probably no animal was attacked by the smell and smoke…"Jacob closed the outer door; however, he had no idea a pair of brown beastly eyes scrutinized this entire scene. The only comforting thing was Jacob didn't go outside or pop up his head, so his identity as a human was still safe.After closing the doors outside, he returned to the small room where only Pig Head could be seen in the green liquid cell while the other was empty now.Jacob had already prepared for the injection process beforehand. He had already found a metal syringe which was exactly 100ml. Jacob couldn't ask for more.However, piercing that eight-inch needle directly into his heart and then injecting the heart essence was a completely different matter.If it was any other time or if he had a choice, Jacob would never play his life like this, but since he had already come to this point, there wasn't any need for hesitation anymore.Jacob filled the warm heart essence in the metal syringe."Sigh… in front of this rising hunger, this little bit of suffering should not be a problem…"Jacob took a deep breath as he lay down on the floor flat and took deep breaths as he held the metal syringe in his hand.Thereupon, mad resolve filled Jacob's eyes as he clenched the metal syringe and instantly stabbed it meticulously between his ribs, directly into his heart!Jacob's eyes opened wide as he grumbled with clenched teeth and endured!However, something completely unexpected happened before Jacob could pump the Heart Essence. His heart rate suddenly increased to an abnormal level, and thereafter, the heart essence slowly simmered into his heart from the metal syringe on its own.Jacob was flabbergasted momentarily, but the warm sensation simmering in his heart with pain quickly snapped out of his stupor."That cursed book didn't warn me about this at all…" vexed Jacob muttered through clenched teeth.At this moment, Jacob felt the warm heart essence spreading through his whole body as his eyes suddenly turned bloodshot before a sudden electric shock ran down his whole body!His body was too weak for such endeavors.Jacob let loose a shrill scream before his eyes went upward, and he lost consciousness!Two hours passed,Jacob finally opened his eyes at this moment with a hint of pain on his face.He sluggishly looked at his chest, saw the metal syringe was still on it, and instantly removed it with a painful groan."What happened? Did I fail? No, I won't be alive if it was the case… my hunger is completely… gone!"Jacob noticed the astonishing change within himself and got up.The first thing he noticed was his vision point had again gone more elevated, which meant his height had increased again, and this change was much more apparent.He stood in front of the glass cell and saw his vague reflection, which alarmed him.Before, Jacob's constitution was skinny. However, his body was now toned with ripped muscles as they were carved.Furthermore, he was now 6.2 feet tall, and his skin was pale white with a slightly rosy sheen. His silver-white hair had also reached his hips and become more shining and silkier. His face was also covered with a long silver-white beard and mustache.Jacob was completely gobsmacked by this tremendous change, and he felt it was all worth it. He had done anything and got an athletic body just by enduring pain.Moreover, he could also feel a strong power within him and a thought surface in his head and the Bloodline Scanning Scale Device.He quickly pressed his thumb on the needle, and a countdown appeared on the black screen.Just like before, a message appeared on the screen."The blood analysis has been completed. Please press the button to check the result!"Jacob pressed the first button without any hesitation."Specie: Human, "Sex: Male,"Age: 23,"Strength: Rare Species,"Bloodline: Unknown,"(Note: Please Purchase a higher-grade device to discover about this bloodline and more information!)""My specie is still human, but my blood had turned unknown from fused? Furthermore, my strength is equivalent to the rare species now! I don't know how much that is, but it is far better than 'Too Weak' from before. I should test it out soon." Jacob mumbled with ecstasy and pressed the next button."Blood Analysis Report:"Unknown Bloodline can't be masseur with the current device!"(Note: Please Purchase a higher-grade device for more accurate blood analysis results and more information!)""Hmph…" Jacob scoffed and pressed the last button."Blood Lifespan:"Unknown"(Note: Please purchase a higher-grade device for more accurate blood lifespan results and more accurate information!)"Jacob's eyes shimmered in astonishment. "My lifespan became unknown as well? It seemed that the cursed book didn't lie to me. As long as I follow its instructions, I will get a hundred years of youthful life!"All the small doubts about cursed immortality completely vanished from Jacob's mind at this moment. He turned off the device and stored it again since it was still useful."I should probably go outside and measure my strength. But first, I have to get rid of this long hair…"Jacob was now brimming with confidence and wanted to see how much improvement and benefits this first injection brought him, and it was also the time to look for an exit from these mountain ranges!

Chapter 39 Improvements (2)
﻿At this time, while the Mountain Giants were getting the report about Decker's hideout,Jacob appeared outside the hideout, followed by Pig Head, as he contemplated the cloudy sky.He had already cleaned himself and cut his hair to shoulder-length while shaving his beard and mustache.This made Jacob's appearance more apparent from his past skinny self. He had a handsome diamond shape face with amber eyes, arched eyebrows, a sharp thin nose, and thin lips. He looked like a handsome youth in his prime."I should slowly scout the area and see if there were any of those rare animals living near here, and then widen my range before leaving on the journey to leave this place. This place is extremely humid, and my water source is about to end, so finding water is my top priority."Jacob mused before he led Pig Head in a random direction, leaving hidden marks on trees, so they could not forget their way back.The hideout was currently on a high mountain that was filled with greenery, and it wasn't far from the mountain peak, just a few miles away.Furthermore, the temperature here can drop quite a lot at nighttime, and many poisonous animals, bugs, and other dangerous creatures roam in this part of the rainy mountain ranges.It was extremely large since it was between two extensive regions of zodiac plains, and if one didn't know about the safe passages, one could roam there aimlessly for years and might die from dehydration, cold, or being eaten by some vicious animal.Jacob only wore crude clothes, and he was barefoot because he didn't Decker didn't have any clothes or shoes of his size. He looked just like a wild barbarian at this moment.While Pig Head only had his waist covered and was even more exposed than Jacob, that listless pig brain seemed to feel nothing.Nonetheless, Jacob also felt he had become quite resilient after the recent changes in his body. Not only did he not feel discomfort walking barefoot or any pain, he felt like he was walking on a soft surface.His body felt extremely light, and he also didn't feel any heat or cold right now. Everything was normal for him, but he knew this was all because of the first injection since he knew how it felt walking like this here before the injection."Follow me closely." Jacob's eyes shimmered with expectation. 'Let's see how fast I can run!'Thereupon, Jacob sprang into action, and he ran at full speed. He was shocked when he felt just how fast he was going right now, and he had this feeling he could go faster.'My speed should be between 60 km/h to 70 km/h, and if I gave it my all, it could probably climb up to 80 km/h, which is almost impossible for a human. Moreover, my body is still not completely compatible with my heart.'Since I still didn't eat the rare meat, I might be at 30% or 35% compatible, and with each injection, my heart will become strong, and my body will follow suit. According to Immortika, with each 10% progress with my cursed heart, my body will transform again…' Jacob's eyes shone with expectation and elation.He never thought he would get this power with a mere injection, and he was already beaming with confidence and more eager to complete the process.Jacob turned around to see Pig Head and was astonished when he saw the guy was only one meter away from him, and he was keeping up with his speed, breaking no sweat.'Just who is this guy, and how did Decker get his hand on him and enslave him? I should probably start examining Decker's journal as well,' Jacob mused as he stopped wasting his energy.Although he can run fast, he could feel superficial fatigue from a 30-second full-speed run.'Speed was not a problem, but how should I measure my strength?' Jacob mused as he looked around. And his eyes landed on a mossy boulder, and his eyes lit up.He galloped to the boulder and tried to lift it; this boulder was three meters in diameter and was probably 250 KG to 300 KG in weight."Hmph!" Jacob grunted coldly before blood vines stirred all over his body as the boulder trembled.Thereupon, Jacob slowly lifted it over his head and then threw it back to the ground, making the ground shake slightly.Jacob breathed for a moment and smiled in satisfaction. "Hehe, with my speed and this strength, I can probably throw quick, powerful punches and shatter rocks. So, this is the strength of a rare species. I should start practicing my Kick Boxing with this body and get the hang of it before moving to those other disciplines I learn that claim to prolong life but do nothing, but they are deadly fighting styles."Jacob made his plan and used his knowledge from his past life to become stronger.Especially the fighting styles he learned in his youth when he earned money by fighting in underground rings, which also helped him to suppress his urges. And this was his biggest source of income, which he used to study and pay his tuition with.Some fighting styles he learned in his old age but not for fighting but for the sake of prolonging his life, and he didn't know how to use them in fighting, and most of them were incomplete.But he had ample experience with Army Boxing, Muay Thai, Aikido, and Street Fighting, all in all, he knew how to use his arms and legs like deadly weapons, so it wasn't a problem for him to get back to his former self in a short period."Let's see if we could find one of those 'Beasts' described in that book before the rain, and if we're lucky, I might be able to inject the second heart essence soon…" Jacob's confidence soared after crudely measuring his strength.However, he didn't know that someone had just reached his hideout and was monitoring it right now!

Chapter 40 Fighting The Arrow Tail Jaguar
﻿Over ten miles away from the hideout,Jacob and Pig Head were hiding behind the shade of a large tree, and Jacob was peering from the side with his cold eyes without making any extensive movement.Fifty meters from the enormous tree, a 2.2-meter animal was resting under it without fear of anything attacking it.Its color was a tan with an orange hue, and its underbelly was white. There were dark spots consisting of solid black markings on its undersides and hollow black circles on its back. It has large teeth, large eyes, four muscular legs, and a long unusual arrow-shaped tail.Jacob's eyes shimmered with astonishment, 'That's an Arrow Tail Jaguar! One of the strongest uncommon species. But its strength is virtually closer to a rare species, and it can fight toe to toe with those rare animals known as beasts! I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky to encounter such a vicious animal. Even in my old world, Jaguars were one of the strongest apex predators.'Jacob naturally got all this information about Arrow Tail Jaguar from the Rare and Rarer Beast Encyclopedia.Although this wasn't a beast, it wasn't far off.In the Rare and Rarer Beast Encyclopedia, any animal that fell in the category of a rare species was known as a beast, and these beasts were as strong as any rare species.'Although it's only an uncommon species, as long as it fell under the tier classification of Immortika, it's useful to me. Since that 'cat' didn't bother to hide its presence, that means there aren't any other animals stronger than it in this vicinity, or it could be just that it's dumb! If I just had a rifle, that cat would be regretting in the afterlife right now!' Jacob bitterly lamented.Even if he had superhuman strength, he still thought weapons that could shoot projectiles were far more effective in this situation.Nevertheless, since he had already spotted the prey, he won't let it get away, and the sky was already getting darker with dark clouds. It won't be long before the rain starts, and Jacob wants to go back before the rain."Pig Head, go and kill that cat for me." Jacob gave a simple command to listless Pig Head, standing like a log beside him. Pig Head instantly sprang into action after receiving Jacob's command, and without caring about the commotion, he directly launched toward the Arrow Tail Jaguar.'Fuck, this guy is too simple-minded. What if that cat runs away after seeing your ferocious appearance?!' Jacob was flabbergasted and cussed.However, nothing like this happened. On the contrary, when the Arrow Tail Jaguar sensed the eruption, it was startled for a moment before its beastly eyes locked on the incoming Pig Head.It viciously growled in Pig Head's direction, showing its big, sharp teeth. It was taking Pig Head as an intruder and prey.Thereupon, the Arrow Tail Jaguar pranced toward Pig Head head-on and leaped at him with two sharp claws in its front.Pig Head expressionlessly threw a punch toward Arrow Tail Jaguar's head. However, at this moment, the arrow tail suddenly moved, and the Arrow Tail Jaguar maneuvered in the air, completely dodging Pig Head's massive punch and clawing at his chest!Jacob's eyes contracted to see this unnatural movement from the Arrow Tail Jaguar. However, he had information about these uncommon animals. But the book didn't describe uncommon animals much, like how they hunt or what kind of special trails they have.Just like how this Arrow Tail Jaguar's arrow tail can help it maneuver in the air, this insignificant detail can be extremely deadly for someone who didn't know about it beforehand.'I should've known better. How could an uncommon species be so easy to deal with? I have been blinded by victory over that brown bastard, and he was just wise, not powerful, while this Arrow Tail Jaguar is powerful. It can kill ten Deckers easily.'Jacob had an ugly expression on his face as he looked at the claw mark on Pig Head's chest, and blood was gushing out nonstop. Although the wounds weren't too deep, it was still deadly if he lost too much blood.He can't afford to lose Pig Head right now, not until he exited the forest or if it was absolutely necessary, and definitely not to this uncommon cat!On the other hand, Pig Head didn't even notice the claw wound on his chest and again sprang into action.The Arrow Tail Jaguar coldly roared and again launched another claw attack, and this time it also wanted to take a bit on Pig Head's hairy neck!However, at this moment, before Arrow Tail Jaguar could dodge Pig Head's punch, its hair stood from its back as if it had sensed something deadly from the side.Now it had to either dodge Pig Head's massive punch or the danger for the side since it can't dodge both.However, just this momentary indecision was enough to spell its doom!Pig Head's punch connected with its left side jaw, and another punch landed on its right ribs!The Arrow Tail Jaguar was sent flying by these two-sided attacks.The second attack was naturally Jacob, who had used his speed and perception to sneak attack the Arrow Tail Jaguar just in the nick of time."Kill it!" Jacob coldly uttered, without giving the Arrow Tail Jaguar any chance of running or recovering from the aftershock.Pig Head obliged without expression as it raised its foot and viciously stomped on Arrow Tail Jaguar's head, which was still in a daze because of the previous attack…'Crack…'The crushing sound of someone's skull being crushed rang in the silent vicinity.Jacob coldly looked at the mingle head of the vicious animal, and he said before Pig Head could stomp on it again, "Enough, it is already dead. I don't want you to trample on my specimen."Pig Head instantly stopped and returned to his listless self!
