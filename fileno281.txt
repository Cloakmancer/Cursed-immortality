Chapter 281 The Walking Disaster (5)
The two ghostly figures standing on top of the discs were still looking at each other while the cubes in their hands were blinking as they showed images of different areas in the beast forest at terrifying speed.However, it was at this moment they suddenly jolted as they both twisted their head in one peculiar direction.The discs under their feet suddenly shimmered before they started to move. But right at this moment, something terrifying happened when out of the blue…"Splash…"One of the figure's heads suddenly blew like watermelon before the disc under his feet could even pick up speed to evade."Boommmm…"It was at this moment; a sonic boom rang in the silent vicinity of the beast forest, and the reaming white robes' person was completely caught off guard by his companion's uncanny death.Before he knew it, the disc and the headless corpse were already falling down the sky while his disc was still picking up speed. He was only snapped out of his stupor when he heard the thunderous sonic boom.The disc under his feet suddenly shimmered in purple light as it started to descend. He clearly wanted to use the trees to disrupt the attacker's vision.But he was too slow as by the time he managed to process what happened, 'Bang…' his head also blasted apart like a balloon."Booommm…"Another sonic boom rang at this moment in the vicinity, and two bodies started to fall from the sky. This entire scene only took about five seconds before the two ghostly figures were dead without even knowing how.Jacob stood holding a two-meter black sniper rifle which was filled with gray stripes, and smoke was rising from its muzzle. Furthermore, those gray strips were shimmering in garish light, and the magic gem embedded in its grip was shining brightly.But the very next moment, the magic gem suddenly cracked before it turned into dust.Jacob wasn't fazed by it as his eyes at this moment were shining in rainbow color before they slowly returned to being amber again, and the smock rising from his figure also cooled down.Jacob looked at the black sniper rifle with a content look. As he turned his hand, a magic gem appeared, and he clicked it in the empty chamber where the old gem was embedded a moment ago.'These enhanced shock absorber magic patterns are really what I needed to control the recoil of my new Iron Titan Sniper. But the magic gem is only enough to sustain two bullets recoils. Sigh… it's too costly. If only I could use magic.'If I want to recreate the Quantum Sniper and then use it without losing a limb, then I need at least top-tier epic magic patterns and epic-tier magic gems.' Jacob lamented as he didn't care about the fact that he had managed to kill two terrifying existence like it wasn't news to him.Jacob knew the moment he took out the Iron Titan Sniper, which was the name he had given it after turning it into a magic weapon. Those guys won't stand a chance against him.Now, he can use Iron Titan Sniper without worrying about suffering a recoil from it. He didn't dare to use it even with his epic physique because he knew his arm would be shattered, just like he ended up in that almost dead state when he used it against the Wight Minister.Although he won't be left in that dead state, it was a wound he wanted to avoid at all costs. That's why he was so hell-bent on learning the Magic Smithing to find a way to avoid such a situation, and he did.The Magic Patterns were something only a magic smith could create with unique magic smiting techniques. Different magic smiting techniques result in different magic patterns.Like the enhanced shock absorber, magic patterns were Jacob's favorite, and he got the technique for them in the manual bought from the champion's space. Even the alchemy guild's shop didn't have them.In Jacob's understanding, this technique was probably for Elder Grandmaster Rank Magic Smiths since it was the technique written in the Elder Grandmaster Section of the manual.So, it was only natural that the alchemy guild shop of rare plains didn't have them.Anyhow, Jacob's new guns were all-powerful, and they were magic with this technique.Although they were not truly magic guns since they couldn't be used with magic bullets, he didn't need magic bullets when he could create even more powerful bullets than magic bullets as long as he put his mind to it.One could say that Jacob now can put many of the ideas which seemed impossible in his old life into theories, and he would only grow as long as he continued to acquire more knowledge of this world's technology, especially magic technology.Jacob then put his new gun back and quickly headed in the direction where the bodies fell. He was also quite interested in those two discs, which seemed to be like some hoverboard.Furthermore, with those two explosive sounds from his guns, he knew those guys searching for him were all coming in this way, so he had to collect their bodies and belonging first before he started dealing with the others. With his excellent vision and sense of smell, he quickly found the two bodies and the discs. He didn't have time to check them as he stored them in his pendant and decided to enjoy a feast later after he got rid of all those pests.---What Jacob didn't know was the moment he killed those two guys on the discs, within the hidden library in the dark city.The Goblette, impassively reading an old cover book, suddenly heard an electric voice."Iron Puppet Assassins has been killed by the target!"Iron Class Kill Order has entered the second stage!"5 Iron Puppet Assassins have been dispatched!"The Goblette merely glanced at the reverse black hourglass, which was still working in reverse, before she returned to reading as if nothing had happened!

Chapter 282 The Walking Disaster (6)
After collecting the two bodies and discs, Jacob was in a good mood.He looked in the direction of the commotion, and his lips rose in an icy smile as he told Immortika, "Let's start the operation. Just tell me if I missed someone."The next moment, Doom Assassin Short Swords appeared in his hand. The dark gray blades were the same, but the skulls from the sword hilts were now replaced with two palm-size black bearings.Jacob felt the Doom Assassin Short Swords weight which was one ton each and then started to spin them agilely like they were nothing but feathers, and the next moment, he vanished, leaving behind a blur."Captain, we are only a hundred meters away from the explosion area!" A black-clad figure spoke in his star watch while he nimbly moved between trees, and he was heading straight in Jacob's direction."Good, keep your guard up. There is more than one group in this place, and they are probably after our target. As long as they are here to kill him, don't get in their way. Let them take the lead even to probe and wear out the target. We'll get the rewards as long as he dies. It matters not if someone else kills him. What matter is he's dead tonight!" A raspy voice rang in reply.Almost all the mercenaries received the same kind of command from their captains.If it were two years ago, they would've all been fighting for the kill, but now it was completely different. Their commission has been changed from a bounty to must kill order, and rewards will be given to everyone who participates in this hunt and manages to get rid of the target.At a mile in the northeast direction, Skull No. A-1 stood with a party of nine, and they were also listening to a report from his scout, "There are over three hundred unknown personnel, and they are all after our target. What is your command?"A-1's eyes narrowed, "It doesn't matter. We need to bring him in alive. Let the other side attack first. Just don't lose sight of him anymore. As long as the other side draw out all his trump card, we'll interfere." "Unders….kikkk…." The voice suddenly cut abruptly with a strange cry."What happens?" A-1 was bewildered as he asked, but no reply came as the connection was completely lost."I think he's been killed." A heavy voice rang from one of the 4-meter-tall giant figures."The question is by whom." Another giant figure coldly chuckled.A-1's grim voice rang, "It seemed we needed to step in sooner, gentlemen. We can't let the target getaway today, or we'll never get a chance to go into higher plains. So, I need everyone to use your full power today…""Boomm…."His voice was disrupted by a huge explosion over six hundred meters away from their position, and a huge fire could be raised."Oh, someone already used an explosive magic spell of nine-star rank." A woman's voice filled with interest rang."Let go before he gets killed!" A long sword appeared in A-1's hand before he moved in the direction of the commotions.However, as they got closer, they could hear screams ringing all around them, and those screams were absolutely bone-chilling as they rang all over the forest while all kinds of explosions rang.For a moment, they rang from the east, and the next moment they rang from the south. It was like a war zone. But this made the top ten A-rank skulls of the killer skull society even more confused. Since there should be only one target, how could everyone start fighting each other?Not only the ten skulls, but there was another group of 32 universal mercenaries. They were all official members, not reserve members, and three of them among them were dark baron-level dark nobles of the dark city.This group was the true upper echelon of the mercenary agency in the rare plains, and they were all going to leave the rare plains in over a year when the reinforcement from the epic plains arrived to suppress the dark beings.They all came here with their underlings, beaming with confidence. But now they were all panicking as their numbers suddenly started to feel down like a waterfall."What the fuck is happening? Who is attacking our men?!" A booming voice rang in the forest.It was a giant wearing menacing-looking black armor while holding a 6-meter-long halberd while he was trembling with rage and trepidation."Lord, Fire Cannon, we lost contact with three more scouts, and three more leader-level figures have left the hunting chat!" Another giant grimly informed Fire Cannon, who was the second most powerful official mercenary present in the dark city and a baron-ranked dark noble."What, those fools cut the contact as well? What the fuck are they doing?" Fire Cannon didn't hide his booming voice as he was now completely enraged."Maybe they're just killed by me?" At this moment, an icy voice replied."Who…?!" Fire Cannon was startled as he twisted his body in the voice direction, and he was instantly horrified when he saw his right-hand man, who was just alive a moment ago, was now falling to the group as his giant head was rolling over.Not only that, but a dark figure was right in front of his face and only a meter away. Time seemed to slow down as Fire Cannon saw two sharp streaks headed toward his neck in a scissors-like motion.At this moment, Fire Cannon, a mountain giant, who wasn't afraid of even death, felt the fear of impending death as that dark figure appeared akin to a grim-ripper who couldn't resist as his body froze in place.'Swish…'Fire Cannon felt his vision start to twist as all the feelings he had a moment ago started to slip away. He only heard atrocious muttering before everything faded away,"I wonder if I should take these giants' hearts, but it would take too much space. Forget it. They're just trash. I should take their rings, weapons, and star watch…"

Chapter 283 The Walking Disaster (7)
In the dark night, the magic beast forest today was filled with horrified screams, and blood dyed the soil.Dead bodies dropped like rain as all of their head were cleaved, and not only that, but their chest was all cut open, and their hearts were missing with their star watches and rings.This caused those people who came here with the intent to kill completely shudder, even those high and mighty experts with status."Lord Fire Cannon connection has also been lost." A hobgoblin standing beside another hobgoblin said with trepidation."I'm leaving." The hobgoblin said in his star watch before disconnecting it, and then he looked at the other hobgoblin beside him, "Order our men to retreat something is terribly wrong with this place!" The hobgoblin ordered, and he turned around without hesitation."Going somewhere?" A ghost-like voice suddenly rang, and before the hobgoblins could even react, their head was rolling as their bodies took a few steps before they fell down.Jacob scoffed, looking at the dead Hobgoblins as he went ahead and harvested their hearts before he took their star watches and one space ring which the hobgoblin was wearing.It only took him five seconds before he moved toward another target."It seemed these guys are now planning to run, hehe." Immortika wrote."But can they?" Jacob sneered as he entered 2X acceleration, increasing his sense range even more, not to mention his speed. The renaming members of the other hunting parties now realized that they were not the ones who were hunting, but they were the prey here, and the hunter turned out to be none other than their prey.They knew the target was a wolf in sheep's clothing.However, their retreating efforts were all turned into nothing but meaningless struggle as more blood-curdling screams reverberated in the vicinity, and those screams only belonged to those who were scared out of their minds.But as soon as those screams rang, they died down the next moment."Gathered together, everyone! He's hunting us down one by one, gathered together if you want to survive!" A booming voice rang in the vicinity, and it was filled with rage and panic."We, the Universal Mercenaries, invite everyone to work together to fight against this fiend!" Another loud roar sounded like thunder."Killer Skull Society gathered with the mercenary friends!" A heavy voice replied as those guys who were running like headless chicks started to snap out of their stupors, and they ran in those voices' direction like crazy.They all now understand that they will be dead eventually if they continue to run like this, and the other party seems to know exactly where they are running.Even those top ten A-rank skulls realized that the Faceless Ancient wasn't a target at all, but he was a predator who they had underestimated terribly.So, they forget about their actual motive and decide to retreat from this death trap before reporting it to A-0. They had thoroughly underestimated Faceless Ancient, and they needed more than numbers to take down that guy.They couldn't even trap him because they couldn't even see him as if he was a ghost!Jacob stopped in this track as he looked in the direction of the voice and listened around, and smiled deviously, "Well, they're making it even easier for me to get rid of them. All those guys are now gathering in one place.""Now, this is what you called a true way to live. Just kill them all and take whatever you need once you have the strength. I suggest you kill everyone in the rare plains. Who knows, you might find more surprises like those two guys. No one can stop you. ahahha..." Immortika revealed its nefarious plan.Jacob looked at the bloodthirsty suggestion and scoffed, "I'm only doing it because those guys provoke me first. Besides, the moment I start massacring every living being I see, I'm pretty sure I'll be even more hated than the dark begins."You yourself said that there's a godly existence like Zodiac Will, so I want to avoid it as much as I can, and I'm pretty sure you wanted to do the same. So, stop with your moronic suggestions.""How do you know I want to avoid it? Hehehe..." Immortika questioned."That's something I want to know as well." Jacob candidly replied."Curiosity killed the cat." It wrote ambiguously."There's not an option when curiosity is part of the cat. So, as long as you are on my side, I hope you will eventually reveal the problems, especially those that could get me killed." Jacob honestly stated, and he got no reply which he was not surprised about.Five minutes later, "Did all of them gather?" He then asked as he didn't sense any more scattered mob, and all of them were gathered in one place."128 extraordinary-tier-6 and 219 ranks not worth mentioning have been gathered together in a large group. What are you going to do? It better be entertaining! Hehehe.""I have collected enough hearts and some high-tier meat for a meal, so I don't think I need their hearts anymore. The only thing they have valuable is their star watches, and some high-ranking members wore space rings. So, I can kill them without being worried about damaging their bodies anymore." Jacob ambiguously replied before the swords in his hands vanished.He then started moving in a particular direction and stopped when he was only two hundred meters away from the gathered mob.The next moment, he took out a two-meter weapon he placed it on the ground. This weapon consisted of four main components: a barrel, a base plate, a bipod, and a sight.That was a freaking Mortar with magic markings all over it!Jacob then took out a 120 mm blue mortar round with propellant rings, and it was a spin-stabilized bomb. He then loaded it in its muzzle and then set the barrel at a general angle between 45 and 85 degrees.Jacob then placed his hands on the trigger and pulled a murderous smile, "Let's hope they won't be blasted apart by this basic type-1 mortar round!"

Chapter 284 The Walking Disaster (8)
The remnant of the Killer Skull Society and the Universal Mercenaries were all gathered together, forming a huge group.The top ten A-rank skulls also managed to keep themselves alive because the moment they sensed the situation turning worse, they also decided to retreat.But alas, leaving was easier said than done as their numbers continued to decrease even faster. Hence, they had no choice but to team up with the universal mercenaries who were not in any better position than them, if not worse."Bastard, come out if you dare!" A Universal Mercenary Giant who was also the number one ranked among the agency roared out loud furiously. Fire Cannon was like a brother to him, and now he was probably dead, so he was quite eager to have a go at Jacob.But he was rational enough not to go out alone since even he, as a giant, could tell the other party was not any less strong than a giant like him."Visss..."A strange voice suddenly rang in the vicinity drawing everyone's attention, and in unison, they all looked in the direction of this voice.They only saw an object like a shooting star, and the next moment, that shooting star suddenly started to descend right in their direction with terrifying speed."What is...""Run!"Someone roared, but alas, the shooting star was simply too fast, and no one was able to react fast enough as it landed right in the middle of their gathering point, and the next moment,"Boommm..."A terrifying explosion occurred, making the ground shake as if a terrifying earthquake just came out of nowhere. A mushroom cloud rose within the vicinity.Everyone in the vicinity of a hundred meters rises to the ground, and a terrifying shock wave blows away all the trees.Jacob, who had already collected the mortar, stood while leaning with a thick tree without having any intention to move despite the incoming shockwave with a dust cloud.'Swish...'A terrifying wind blew past his position, mixed with dust and heat from the explosion, but it wasn't able to move the thick tree or Jacob, who just stood there.He looked at the book and asked dismissively, "How many managed to survive?""Those 128 extraordinary-tier-6 are still breathing, but barely I guess. While those 219 small fries are raised down to 18, and they are all giants, as expected from those big logs."Jacob nodded, "I suspected as much. I never intended to kill 128 extraordinary-tier-6s since they are the richest of the bunch. Let's collect..."However, before Jacob could speak, he saw the writing on the book suddenly change. "Oh? Someone is coming in this way, and that person's heart matches what you need. I never thought so many guys would be wasting their potential in this shitty place. Well, you can make their life worth it... hahaha!" Immortika suddenly wrote.Jacob's eyes flashed with brilliance, and he only asked one word before the Iron Titan Sniper appeared in his hand, "Where?""What the hell is going on in this place?" A-0, clad in black body armor while his face was hidden under a mantle, looked in the direction of the dust cloud with a grim expression.He exited the dark city and wanted to oversee the entire operation himself, but for some reason, he lost contact with A-1 a couple of minutes ago. Not only he but even everyone involved in the mission couldn't be contacted.However, he got the general location from A-1 before the contact was lost, so he was rushing in this direction when he heard that terrifying explosion and started to feel something was amiss."Don't tell me they can't even apprehend one fucking rat?!" He muttered in indignation.However, when A-0 was only over a mile away from the explosion focal point, he suddenly felt his heart palpitate, and the fine hair on his body stood with goosebumps. His unique racial danger sense roared in alarm.This ability was something that he depended on most, and he knew it couldn't be wrong as it had safe him thousands of times from life-threatening dangers.Without hesitation, he gave in to his instincts and twisted his body and lunged with a sidestep, and smacked into a three.But the moment he just sidestepped, an object at a terrifying speed suddenly brushed past his mantle and barely missed his head and landed on the trees behind and blew it away like it was a water balloon and only just one tree anything that came in that object way blew like that for hundreds of meters.A-0 finally stabilized himself and looked at the damage behind him with a horrified expression, and his heart sank to rock bottom.However, his heart skipped a beat again, and his legs moved on their own. But, this time, he wasn't as lucky as before. Even though he managed to dodge the bullet from blowing his head, it still managed to graze his left cheekbone and even blow away his ear left ear.At this moment, the mantle and mask on his face crumbled, revealing A-0's ghastly face. He had a lion-like face, but his skin was pale yellow, but the most eye-catching feature was his chameleon-like eyes.He looked extremely pale as half of his face was almost blown just now as blood was gushing from the wound, dying his face and neck crimson giving him a ghostly appearance.In his entire life, A-0 probably had never come this close to dying, nor did he dream that someone was capable of pushing him to this kind of state, especially in this place, not by a long shot. He never thought the small chore would turn out to be a deadly mistake.But the impossible had happened, and now he was facing the threat of dying, and he was stunned because his head was ringing from the last brush of the deadly bullet.However, his survival instincts kicked in, and he ran on pure grit to live while trying to regain his senses and calm his nerves. Nothing made sense anymore to him as he just wanted to live!

Chapter 285 The Walking Disaster (9)
Lunging on trees, Jacob, holding the black sniper rifle, was looking at A-0, who was wobbling around the trees while running, and there was a hint of shock in his eyes."He managed to dodge two bullets from my iron titan sniper. Just what kind of species he belonged to?" Jacob asked."Hehe, he's a mix between a High Orc and a Stealth Chameleon. You can say he's a Demi High Orc, and High Orc is a proactive war Legendary Race. So, it's only natural he had their survival instincts. He had the potential to be Unique." Immortika revealed.Jacob was astonished as he looked at A-0, who was slowly regaining his senses and wasn't giving Jacob's chance to take a shot at him anymore as he moved in a zigzag pattern.His speed was not any slower than his when he wasn't using fluid acceleration. But Jacob was already using 5X acceleration, and he was quickly closing in. He no longer planned to waste more bullets since he could get rid of that wounded prick himself now.However, when Jacob was only less than fifty meters away from catching up, he noticed A-0 take out something from his space ring, and it was a white scroll.'It seemed he regained enough focus to remember he had a space ring. And that white scroll is a magic scroll!' Jacob's guard was instantly raised as he knew those magic scrolls were like bombs, and he didn't want to be at the receiving end.So, Jacob threw the notion of saving some bullets as that guy was probably more dangerous if he didn't kill him as quickly as possible.But A-0 had already crushed the white scroll and beat Jacob by a hair before he could take aim.A brilliant light suddenly shone from the point where the white scroll was crushed, hindering Jacob's sight greatly, almost blinding it.Now, it was Jacob's turn to feel impending danger coming his way, and for someone with his current level to feel danger, it was not a joke. So, without hesitation, his acceleration increased to 10X, and he ran in the opposite direction to the incoming whiteness before it could envelop him.When Jacob was fifty meters away from that whiteness, it didn't expand anymore, and when he turned around to see what kind of magic scroll it was, he was shocked because a white doom covered fifty meters radius."A magic barrier?" Jacob instantly guessed.Furthermore, he was feeling danger from that barrier, so he knew it would not bode well for him to come in physical contact with it."Is he hiding there?" He asked Immortika.Because if it turned out to be the case, then he didn't know just how long that barrier would last, so he needed to take some drastic measures to break that barrier without touching it."Hahahahah… what a cunning fellow, that barrier is just a decoy which can fool your senses, and he's already two hundred meters away from using. If you can't feel him, then it might be the result of him using another black scroll." Immortika amusingly wrote."No, that barrier wasn't a decoy. It was most likely meant to trap me within!" Jacob's expression changed as he stopped wasting his time standing there and quickly gave chase. He nearly got fooled by that wounded fellow by thinking that he was hidden in that barrier.'Just who is this guy.' Jacob thought while he followed the direction where Immortika was leading him. He was hell-bent on killing this guy, and the reason was nothing but his precious heart!A-0, who was chucking down vial after vial of crystal green liquid as his wounds were starting to mend, couldn't get rid of that dangerous sensation even after using that precious 9-star blind barrier magic scroll and another 9-star shadow magic scroll.'Why is he so strong… who is he… could it be he's an epic?! No, impossible nobody can go against the restriction of a plain. Just who is he…'However, the feeling of dead enveloping him rose again, and he jumped down."Kboomm..'"Ahhhhh…."He screamed when he saw his leg had been blown off despite his managing to save his head.'He can see me… no, no, I'm going to die. I don't want to die!' A-0 felt his mind on the verge of a breakdown, and with the pain, it started getting worse.He never thought he would die like this, and he didn't even have a chance to retaliate as the other party was simply too terrifying to track him down. But he knew the true reason for his demise was that weapon which was even faster than his danger sense.His reaction speed which should be around Epic-tier-1 was nothing in front of the bullet speed, and this type of weapon shouldn't exist on the rare plains."Ahhh…haa… s-stop! Please stop! I-I… why are you attacking me?!" He roared with an appalled expression while surpassing his pain.At this time, Jacob finally landed a few meters in front of A-0, who looked like a mess with his leg blown and his face still filled with blood."Because I like your heart." Jacob dismissively replied before he left an afterimage and appeared right in front of A-0, and his short sword had already appeared in his hand.Appalled, A-0 never thought this guy would be so decisive as he didn't even wait for him to react."Wait… I'm D….kikk."The sword blade passed through his throat before he could even complete his words, and the light in his eyes dimmed down as his head rolled on the group within his own blood."I don't care who you are." Jacob scoffed as he stowed away A-0's entire body leaving behind his mingled head.Jacob had already felt A-0's movement of hand when he tried to talk with him, and he knew he was up to no good. He had seen and heard too many scenarios when giving a chance to your enemy to talk could be fatal.Jacob hadn't killed A-0 because he was his enemy. He didn't even know if he was an enemy or just a passerby or someone who was drawn in by that explosion. The guy didn't even attack him first.Jacob killed A-0 because he had something he needed, and he couldn't stop him from taking it. It was that simple!

Chapter 286 How Sad…
Ellie sat in front of a jade table, and there was a palm-size rectangular white sheet placed on it. She held a long thin brush which was shimmering in a purplish hue as she elegantly made strokes on the white paper.With every stroke, a purplish line would appear on the paper despite there wasn't any sort of ink, and thereby it turned into a rune symbol. With every successfully carved rune symbol, the white paper seemed to be pulsing.When the fifth rune symbol was done, her hand stopped moving before the white paper suddenly encased in a purple brilliance. Thereupon, the brightness fades away, and what is left is the white paper with a purple line pattern all over it. The runes have vanished somehow.Ellie doesn't seem to be surprised by it as she places the white brush, which now looks like a normal paintbrush, on the jade table and then picks up a small crystal stamp beside it.It also shimmered in a purple hue before she turned the white paper around and stamped its empty size with her stamp, and when she removed it, a beautiful symbol of a purple eagle which looked extremely vivid, appeared on it.She muttered with a hint of satisfaction, "I can finally create an Intermediate-Type-2 Talisman on my first try. I am getting closer to reaching the intermediate stage of the Rune Artificer Elder Grandmaster Rank."At this moment, she suddenly frowned as she looked at her wrist before a projection appeared, and the next moment a hint of shock flashed past her eyes when she was a message, and there was a video file attached to it."Faceless Ancient Sent Mail: I have killed 682 people today, and I don't know who was who since they all came after me. But I'm pretty sure over half of them were universal mercenaries."I have no way to confirm their identities, but I do record their appearances, and there is also the exact moment of me killing these guys, so this video is legit. There were also some other guys, but their appearances weren't 'presentable' or 'intact.'"Anyway, I don't know how you're going to confirm their identities since it would be a hassle, so Vice President, you can just send me 150,000 ZC for this service, and we'll consider the trade between us a success." "682?! Does he think I'm an idiot?" Ellie muttered in disbelief, but still, she opened the video file.The video file was an hour long, and as she played it, she was instantly captivated by it when she saw the starting scene was of some black-clad guy who was seemed to hiding in a tree, but almost instantly, that guy's head started rolling down, it was simply too fast, and then the scene changed."What?" Ellie was bewildered as her disbelief expression turned solemn. She then activates the 360-degree video mode as any video recorded by a type-1 Star Watch was a 360-degree video by default.Furthermore, the video quality was like a movie, and everything was clear as day. There was even a 50X slow motion option in the videos recorded in advance type-1 Star Watches.But Ellie's start watch can go to 1000X slow motion, and she used it without hesitation to watch the first scene frame by frame, and she watched Jacob, not the dead guy.In the end, her eyes were filled with disbelief and a hint of appalling, "Just what kind of monster is he?"She then watched the next scene, and there was the same result. Toward the end, there were just recording of dead bodies. There were only 40 scenes where Jacob was seen beading people like he was cutting chickens, and those scenes were all recorded at the exact moment he was going to deliver the killing blow, not the entire process.Still, just this much was enough to reveal his capabilities in the assassination, and not only that, but Ellie also noticed some dead bodies at the end were completely charred and missing limbs, as if they were at the center of a terrifying explosion.Ellie took a deep breath before her lips curled up in an icy smile, "We only wanted to test his capabilities by giving him this mission, but he's out of our expectations. Even Dad might've never thought that he was capable of this kind of feat."When he suggested that he would be capable of coming in here without us interfering. He only said there were over 30% chances of us winning, and even if Lucy ended up breaking the bet or we did, we won't lose a thing."On the other hand, Lucy would've suffered losses to take the champion of the rare plains down. But just this much loss to the bank is enough to get Lucy to bleed like the old bitch she is."It seemed our 30% chances have increased to 55%, and if we can interfere with Lucy's interference and stop her from killing him to void the bet, those chances will rise to 80%!"I need to tell Dad. Soon Lucy would start to take it even more seriously!" Ellie's eyes shimmered in excitement, but she stopped all of a sudden and then opened another application which was the bank application."I should reward my dog first to keep him happy. He wanted 150K ZC. I'll give him 200K to make him even more obedient!" With a dark smile, she transferred 200k ZC to Jacob's account.Then she instantly contacted the Guild President, Nelsen!---While Ellie was gloating at her good luck, someone else was going to suffer from bad luck.Lucy was looking at the projection of an elegant elf male as her usually aloof eye were filled with disbelief as she asked, "So, you're saying you lost all contact with our hunting group over an hour ago? What about the team members?""I've already tried multiple times, but none of them is responding. I've already sent another small team to investigate the situation!" The elf respectfully replied with a hint of trepidation in his voice."Inform me as soon you receive any news!" Lucy cut the call with a frown."What is going on?" She muttered.However, at this moment, she received a message from Ellie, and when she read it, she knew something was extremely wrong,'Amiable Monk Fish (Reply): Sending your men to die, how sad. I wonder how the Bank will react!'

Chapter 287 Skull No. S-0
At an unknown place, dark miasma covered the horizon as if nothing was visible in this strange, mysterious place. However, a couple of a hundred meters deep underground was a humongous space, and in this space was built a metropolis.In a towering building, a masked woman in a lab coat was standing in front of a glass cell and recording something in a hologram in her hand.At this moment, an electric voice rang in the lab, "Lord S-0, you have an utmost important call."S-0 focus was broken with that abrupt notification, and she knew only a single person was capable of triggering this kind of notification.So, she quickly changed the projection on her wrist and opened the call interface, and when she saw the name, she knew she was right about the identity of the caller. So, she quickly accepted the audio call."My Lord…""A-0 is dead, and so does the top 100 of A ranks with him!" A ghastly voice rang, cutting S-0 between her sentence.S-0 eyes instantly widened when she heard the news, and her body trembled as she blurted, "How is that possible?!"She knew better than anyone just how powerful A-0 was, and he should be able to preserve his life even if he encountered an epic. But his death with the top 100 A ranks was a massive shock to her, and if it was true, then it was an unforgivable blunder!"You tell me." The ghastly voice coolly replied. The voice may sound indifferent, but there was a clear, frigid intent laced within.S-0 was lost for words as she herself couldn't wrap her head around this abrupt turn of events."M-my Lord, give me some time to investigate. He might've been siege by some hidden enemy, and in the process, his brain chip might've been damaged. So, there's still a chance he's not dead!" S-0 refused to believe that A-0 could die in the rare plains."Hehe, do you think I would've called you if I hadn't confirmed it? You know quite well a Skull with the number 0 has a special brain chip implanted in their brains that can send us video feedback for 1 minute before a number 0 dies. So, are you getting retard, or are you suggesting I'm a retard?" The ghastly voice asked in derision.S-0 instantly kneeled down as her entire body was feeling goosebumps despite the fact that she was only talking with a voice. It was a kind of fear that simmered into her very being."I-I didn't dare! It was me who lost my rationality! Please forgive my lord; please forgive me!" She started to plead."Enough with this nonsense. Tell me, how are you going to retrieve our 'assets' on A-0 and the data from the cannibal plan?" The ghastly voice sternly questioned.S-0 quickly replied, "I'll go myself to complete this mission!""Humph! I'm giving you one more chance to make everything right. I want the assets and data before the epic trial begins. Or you will be demoted to S-1 rank, and you will have to complete a Dark Skull Mission to make amends!"Done saying its piece, the voice ended the call without waiting for any reply.S-0's eyes were filled with despair when she heard the punishment. A few moments later, she finally managed to collect herself.An eerie voice of teeth grounding rang at this moment in the silence lab before S-0 furiously roared, "Who did this?! Show me A-0 last vision!"Her eyes were bloodshot as she saw a video appear on her star watch interface and started to play. When she saw how almost all the video was A-0, running for his life, and then he was maimed by some extremely fast projectile towards the end, she was dumbfounded.But this video was like a normal video as it didn't have a 360-degree feature, and it could only show what A-0 saw before his impending death for up to 1 minute. So, she didn't have any clue what kind of thing hit him that tore apart his leg or how he was wounded before."Ahhh…haa… s-stop! Please stop! I-I… why are you attacking me?!"At this time, Jacob finally landed a few meters in front of A-0, and S-0's eyes instantly widened as she knew who this guy might be."Faceless Ancient, but how!?" She blurted in disbelief as she watched with hatred in her eyes."Because I like your heart." Jacob dismissively replied before he left an afterimage and appeared right in front of A-0, and his short sword moved, "Wait… I'm D….kikk." this was the end of the video."Just how can he be so powerful? Didn't that bastard say the target was only from the common plains, and he was only a rare rank species when he appeared in the rare plains? Then how could he have the strength to corner and kill A-0?!"Then there is that weapon which maimed A-0 while running. It has to be a gun, but that wasn't a type-2 magic bullet, or his entire torso would've been blown by that shot, not just his leg."So, it was not a magic bullet but a mech bullet. The real question is, how in the world did he manage to get his hands on a type-2 gun and its bullets?" S-0 muttered like crazy.She was still finding it hard to believe that A-0 was killed by a single person, not an entire army, and that person happened to be the one she had sent A-0 to apprehend herself.In a sense, A-0 was also under S-0's pressure, so he had no choice but to move out himself, but he never thought he could get killed so easily by Jacob.Now, S-0 was in an even worse situation, and she knew if she didn't do something, she might never be able to enjoy the life of luxury anymore, and her high status would be stripped.But what she was most afraid of was the Dark Skull Mission, which is a kind of suicide mission that the Killer Skull Society only gives those skulls who were incompetent and had messed up big time.Now it was a life or death situation for S-0!

Chapter 288 Big Accumulation!
After dealing with the massive mob of enemies, Jacob was feeling somewhat lethargic. He knew he had exhausted a massive amount of energy in a couple of hours of running around while using fluid acceleration and pinpoint focus.If he didn't have the Unique Endurance of a Wyvern, he might've never kept up with this many enemies, and energy consumption was already hungry beyond salvation, not just lethargic.However, he wasn't worried about it in the least bit since he had already 'collected' his dinner. Right now, he was in some cavern of magic beast forest that he snatched from an extraordinary tier-6 spike bear after killing it.There was a large bonfire, and three skewered bodies were roasting over the fire while Jacob was busy gutting the reaming bodies he collected from the mob. As for the three bodies already on the skewered, they were the three bodies of the legendary decadents.He knew once he consumed their hearts raw, he needed to consume high-grade nutrition to make his body compatible. That's why he's been collecting all the bodies he deemed satisfactory to his need.However, deep down, he knew these extraordinary beings were no longer enough for his epic body. If his Cursed Blood Condensing percentage increased by a large amount, all this meat, including those three legendary descendants, won't be enough to quench his hunger.Still, he knew it was likely to be impossible for his Cursed Blood Condensing percentage to increase by a large margin. Even a direct legendary bloodline, the Fire Wyvern, only provides him with 4.9%.So, these three, who were not even the second or third generation, would likely only provide him with 1% or even less. That's why he wasn't worried about not being able to quench his hunger.In any blue moon chance, even if that happened, it wasn't like he wasn't ready!Jacob then skewered ten more bodies around the bonfire before he sat down on the corner, leaning against the wall."Well, Immortika's time for today has ended, so I won't be able to keep track of my Cursed Blood Condensing percentage. Anyhow, I have collected three optimal hearts for Cursed Blood Condensing, while I have 389 hearts of extraordinary tier-6s."Although they are not optimal for Cursed Blood Condensing, if I eat them all, they might leave me 0.1, or if not, they will be my nutrition." Jacob chuckled before he flipped his hand, and a warm heart appeared, which was actually black.This heart belongs to one of the two guys he killed at the start, and strangely their hearts were black. Furthermore, when Jacob unwrapped those black clothes from their bodies, he was shocked when he saw they didn't have faces nor eye sockets, or mouths!Meaning their face were completely made with skin, and there were only two holes for nostrils in the middle of their face and two small ear holes. They didn't even have hair on their head or their entire body, as a matter of fact.The strangest thing was their bodies were spotless, as if they were born this way.They also didn't wear any star watches or have any space rings. They didn't even carry small bags. All he got was two cubes and two discs, and that's it.Their appearances made even Jacob uncomfortable, and if Immortika hadn't assured him they were both eatable, he might not even wanted to eat their meat.Last but not least, A-0, that guy's heart was normal and only slightly a bit bigger than a human heart by three inches. Not only that, but he collected 10 Space Rings from A-0's hands, and from the look, he could tell they were all at least advance type-1 space rings!This discovery made Jacob shocked, and he guess this guy's identity had to be quite startling. He still didn't have any clue that he was the Important Grace34 he had few unpleasant interactions with, or he might've already been grinning.Except for those rings, he also managed to collect 52 space rings and 603 Star Watches, and they were the ones he could find. He knew there were some star watches missing under that explosion, but he wasn't bothered by them.If he sold all those star watches, he would make a huge profit, and that's why he's been collecting them.As for the space rings, they were still useless to him since he couldn't open them, which was quite frustrating, but Jacob had a plan for solving this problem of his. But the solution can't be used right now, and it was a long shot, so he still has to bear with it.Without hesitation, he removed his mask, revealing his peerless face, and started to eat those hearts one after another.As he ate the three hearts, he felt his veins start to heat up, but not as much when he ate the fire wyvern heart. This feeling was quite vague and vanished by the time he finished eating his 32nd heart.That feeling of heat was then replaced with the feeling of warmth as he ate more hearts. Not only was he recovering, but he was also slowly becoming stronger. He was too familiar with this feeling and couldn't have enough of it.Just like that, two hours passed, and Jacob was still feeling lethargic but not as much as when he started eating those hearts. "Sigh... this is becoming more and more absurd." He sighed in exasperation and was about to turn his focus on the skewered bodies, which should have been cooked by now, when his star watch vibrated.He frowned as he opened the interface and saw it was a notification."Amiable Monk Fish sent 200,000 ZC to your Bank Account!"New Balance: 277,738 ZC""Didn't I ask for 150k? Why did she send me 200k?" Jacob muttered with a hint of wariness. He wasn't a fool who would believe that Ellie sent him 50k ZC out of the kindness of her heart.However, his focus was broken when the star watch vibrated again, and the interface changed on its own.Jacob knew his interface could only be changed on its own when someone sent him an unignorable Call Request, and he was right!

Chapter 289 I’ll Wait For You!
"Apocalyptic-S wanted to send you a Voice Call!""Accept""(NOTE: Apocalyptic-S has used Star Privilege to send an unignorable Call Request. Apocalyptic-S Star Privilege is higher than You (Faceless Ancient), Notification can't be ignored, Star ID can't be blocked!)"Frowning, Jacob thought it was quite strange to receive a call from a new big boss-level character at a time like this, so he was quite sure it had something to do with what he did. For some reason, he thought about the last guy he killed.Nevertheless, he would find out once he accepted the call, and this was just a voice call, so it was clear that the other part also didn't want to show its pace nor wanted to see his. So, he accepted the call without hesitation.Apocalyptic-S's crisp voice sounded at this moment, and it was icy cold, "Mr. Faceless Ancient, do you know what you have done?"Jacob was speechless hearing this woman's ambiguous words and retorted coldly,"I have no idea who you are and what I have done to you. So, you better get to the point before I cut this call, and don't even think for a second I will pick it up again even if you call me 24/7.""Hmph! You do have a temper, don't you? Alright, I'll get straight to the point. I want you to return everything you took from Killer Skull Society, and I consider this matter over between you and my Killer Skull Society!" Apocalyptic-S revealed her true intentions, and her tone was extremely overbearing.Jacob's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise when he understood the other party was from killer skull society, and a feeling of déjà vu washed over him.It was clear that this woman was clearly quite a high ranking in the killer skull society and probably at the same level as Gunner and Lucy. So, she won't contact him just to demand the return of their items.Furthermore, he knew Important Grace should be in charge of this place, so if anyone, he should be the one contacting him, and unless that guy didn't want to make his superiors unhappy, he wouldn't tell them that he was helpless against him.Even if he killed hundreds of Killer Skull Society members, it should be A-0 to contact him and then threaten him, not this high-ranking woman from the society.So, unless there was something special involved in last night's massacre which could alarm this Apocalyptic-S that was even out of the reach of A-0, she shouldn't have contacted him.Lastly, she was speaking quite ambiguously. She wasn't demanding that data he took from the common plains directly but 'items' which made his conjecture even more solid.Then again, the last kill appeared in his mind, and the ten space rings.His eyes flashed as he subtly replied, "I have some unpleasant encounter with your organization, and it was you guys who provoked me first, and I always acted in self-defense."As for the things I took, they are my compensations for all the traumas I have been through. This means I don't give two shit about my enmity with your clown society just send more of your little clowns, or better, just come here yourself. I promise I'll skin you alive as I did with your little pet, Important Grace." Jacob's tone was even more overbearing as he uttered. He was not afraid of killer skull society as long as he was in the rare plains, and he knew for a fact that these guys were nothing but cowards who were afraid of three hegemonies.As long as they didn't know when he left the rare plains, they would never be able to harm him, and with his growth rate, he would be invincible in the epic plains eventually."You ant slave! You dare to speak to me like this?!" Apocalyptic-S instantly fly in rage on the other side as she never expected Jacob to be so overbearing despite knowing just what kind of authority she had."Yep, just a little slut who only knows how to wiggle her big cunt and throw out your bastard toys since your ass is too big for you to move." Jacob cursed coldly without holding back, while in actuality, he was completely calm and wanted to confirm if the person he killed in the last was really Important Grace.As for why he thought that he was important grace, it was simple, after he confirmed that the killer skull society was involved in last night's raid and Apocalyptic-S's abrupt call and her overbearing yet anxious attitude to get something back from him.So, he instantly thought about the guy who came at the end, and he had astonishing trump cards, so he could only think of one person in the killer skull society who could trigger the alarm in the epic plains, Important Grace himself!What was left was to confirm, and the only way was to anger Apocalyptic-S to the extreme so she could admit it herself, and she already half admitted by not retorting about the important grace death by his hand."You lowly foul, mouth swine, I'll make you eat those words even if you hide under the earth or high in the sky. I'll find you and let you know your place, which is right under my foot!" Apocalyptic-S uttered while chewing on each word in hatred. She had never suffered such humiliation in her entire life, not to mention humiliation at the hand of someone who she considered nothing but an ant.Jacob chuckled coldly, "I'll wait for you. In the meanwhile, I'll sell all that loot and make sure you will never get what you want.""Selling it, huh? I dare you to try it. Let's see who dares to buy it!" Apocalyptic-S threatened before she cut the call. She was clearly not good with words and was already on the verge of going on a rampage.She knew it was impossible to talk with Jacob, and she didn't even offer him the things she prepared in exchange for what he took from A-0 and the data. Now she wanted him dead more than anything, and she knew what she had to do to make that happen!Jacob's arrogant expression turned colder as he mused grimly, 'So, that prick was indeed that important grace, and I took something important to the society again. Is this some kind of sick joke?'

Chapter 290 Reaching The Meeting Point
In the middle of the day, Jacob finally left the cave and headed in the east direction of the inner magic beast forest.After his 'chat' with Apocalyptic-S, Jacob was not feeling as apprehensive as he should have. On the contrary, he wasn't feeling anything, as if it was just a normal day of his day-to-day life.What he was concerned about were those ten space rings he got from A-0, and he wanted to see just what kind of treasures they held that even someone like Apocalyptic-S contacted him personally. Especially when she belonged to an organization like Killer Skull Society, her Star ID should be top secret.'As long as I'm in rare plains, I should be fine. I just need to be careful about my departure from the rare plains. I can't let anyone know I'm leaving rare plains, or the killer skull society might not be the only one seeking revenge.'I'm pretty sure that Lucy's character would suffer some repercussion after I killed probably all the official mercenaries in the dark city. I haven't even left this place yet, and here I already have terrifying enemies in the epic plains.'So, I need more precautions than I already have. And I just happened to head such a place which is helpful…' Jacob's lips rose in a faint, icy smile as he picked up speed.After two hours of traveling at his top speed without fluid acceleration, he stopped in the middle of the forest while he looked at the hologram map on his wrist."The location he sent me should be around somewhere here," Jacob uttered under his breath before he sent a call request to Earth Great Minor!pαndα`noνɐ1--сoМ After five seconds, the call was finally picked up, and a hoarse voice, almost as if dry leaves were rattling together, rang, "Y-you better be calling me to give me good news!" It was clear that Mason was quite desperate."I'm standing at the location you gave me." Jacob coolly replied as he was smiling when he heard Mason's voice. He knew this guy was at the end of his tether."Excellent!" Mason almost cried in mirth when he heard Jacob's words and quickly cut the call.Jacob knew he probably cut the call because he was coming to get him, and he focused on his hearing to hear his footsteps.But to his surprise, he suddenly felt a faint tremor under his feet before he saw that just ten meters left from his standing position, the trees suddenly started to shift left and right as if they were sliding.Under Jacob's astonished eyes, the trees slide over five meters, revealing an underground pathway.'Impressive.' He thought as he could clearly tell this hideout was much more high-tech than the hideouts he had seen in the common plains.Occasionally missing content, please report errors in time.
