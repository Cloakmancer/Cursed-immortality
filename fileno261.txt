Chapter 261 Alchemy Guild Leader Of Dark City
﻿In the Dark Noble City Circle of the Dark City was a black castle in the very center of the noble city circle. It was the Dark Castle where the mysterious highest-ranking noble of the Rare Plains Dark City lived, the Dark Earl!Only a Dark Baron rank noble was eligible to meet with the Dark Earl; for others, the Dark Earl was only a ghost.However, if others knew this mysterious, enigmatic Dark Earl was laughing crazily while holding a silver pill with a red threads-like marking and his appearance was not any better than coal mine worker, the dark city would lose all face."…ahaha… I finally made this damn Basic Type-2 Berserker Pill! I can finally be a Dark Alchemist and leave this forsaken place!" Hallberg guffawed as he was on the verge of shedding tears from pure bliss.However, Dark Rose's electric voice rang, almost making him drop the Berserker Pill, "Lord Hallberg, there is a level-3 alert!"A sense of déjà vu hit Hallberg as he remembered the last time Dark Rose contacted him over a week ago, was also telling him about the level-1 alert and nearly blowing his lab in the process.Now, there was a level-3 alert, and he became vigilant as he asked with a frown, "What is it this time?" "Faceless Ancient had killed a Senior Grandmaster Rank Alchemist a few moments ago!" Dark Rose reported emotionlessly.Hallberg's eyes went wide as he exclaimed, "What? Are you joking? And no one stops him?"He was really astonished since he had never expected to hear such news because it had been a long time since someone had killed someone in the dark city, and the person in question was a Senior Grandmaster nevertheless."I can't joke. And no one was able to stop him." Dark Rose emotionlessly replied.Hallberg frowned, "No one was able to stop him? Is that guy really that powerful? But why did he kill a Senior Grandmaster, and how did you handle it?"Hallberg knew Dark Rose had full authority to act and then report it to him. She wasn't like those AIs of the three hegemonies who couldn't act unless they were given order and bonded by authority restrictions.Dark Rose was even more special than the Alchemy Guild's proud creation, the White Sage. She was given full authority over the Dark City and could make independent decisions according to the situation.Even a Dark Earl like Hallberg could not interfere if his decision were harmful to the Dark City, and he would be punished if he overstepped his boundary. That's what truly makes the Dark City impartial.Dark Rose replied, "He acted according to the Alchemy Guild's law and regulation, and the Guild's AI: White Sage confirmed it, and he also has Star-1 privilege. So, according to clause #884, I charged him with a fine of 100ZC and gave him a warning. As for his prowess, I have no authority to break into his personal data or spy on him, or Star Network will erase me."Hallberg's expression went strange, "White Sage confirmed it? Do you mean he's an official alchemy guild member? Wasn't he a member of the association?""Over a week ago, Faceless Ancient identity badge had been changed from the alliance to the guild's Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith." Dark Rose emotionlessly replied.Hallberg's expression turned even more strange, "A Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith, and he's as strong as an eight-star knight. Is he an official member of the alliance or the guild? Nevertheless, he would be a genius if he could reach these ranks in both hegemonies."That sneaky fellow Braylon might make things difficult for him since he will not sit still while his authority gets challenged by someone else. Well, it's good, I guess; it will be far better to make a move and have a good impression by getting him out of this trouble."Hallberg's eyes lit up as he felt it was a great plan to play the good guy to win over talent.However, Dark Rose's next words instantly burst his bubble, and the pill in his cracked by the sheer force he put in his finger because of the surprise."Lord Hallberg, the Rare Plains Dark City Alchemy Guild's Leader authority has just been transferred from Senior Grandmaster Braylon to Sir Faceless Ancient. According to our contract with the Alchemy Guild, he can now enter the Dark Inner Circle City's, Alchemy Guild!"---At this moment, a masked figure walked out from the exit of the alchemy guild's building.This person was none other than Jacob, who was in quite a good mood after getting unexpected benefits after robbing Braylon of his items, money, and authority.Jacob never believed that Braylon would resist unless he didn't cherish his life, which he did very much. Jacob knew such a person who cherished his life above anything when he saw one and would do anything to have a chance at living. He was such a person as well.However, unlike Braylon, he never goes out scheming and causes trouble unless he is absolutely sure of his victory.Anyhow, talk about benefits, the first one he got was naturally an extra 58,139 ZC balance, of which 20,594 ZC came from Braylon, and most surprisingly, 31,193 came from none other than Otto. At the same time, the rest belonged to those other Senior Grandmasters, including Rita.Otto's balance instantly drew Jacob's attention, and he gave the dwarf a meaningful look which made the other party shudder with bloodshot eyes. Still, he didn't expose him and didn't care much where that money came from since it was now his.If he wants it back, he can look for him anytime.In the end, out of the kindness of his heart, Jacob still left them with 1 ZC each so they could still pay for their dwelling expenses in the Dark City.The second benefit he received came from snatching Braylon's authority as Guild Leader. It turned out the Guild Leader of the Alchemy Guild in Dark City has a status equal to an Upper-Rank Dark Noble.This means now he could enter the Inner Circle of the Dark City and didn't have to pay to prolong his stay in the rare plains Dark City!That's also the reason for him leaving the guild building right away. He wanted to go to the inner circle post hastily. Just Braylon's workshop in the inner circle was enough for Jacob to head there immediately, not to mansion other things unique to the inner circle.There was nothing left here for him anyway.Lastly, the third benefit also came from Braylon, which was none other than material for Blood Insect Enslavement Ritual Array, the Rainbow Star Dust!

Chapter 262 A Mysterious Place
﻿Jacob exits the taxi after paying fifty gold coins. A thousand meters away from him was a colossal wall that went all the way to the ceiling of the Dark City. There were no gates in this wall, but instead, there were skyways built for cable lifts. At this moment, Jacob was standing right outside the station of these cable lifts.'So, behind that wall is the Dark Inner Circle of the Dark City? Quite a brilliant idea to make skyways instead of gates. They took full advantage of the underground terrain and made their core areas almost impossible to sneak into.' Jacob thought with a faint cold smile, 'Let's see if I can find more interesting things in there.'Without hesitation, he walked inside the station, which was quite empty since those nobles of the inner circle seldom appeared in the common circle, just like Braylon.Jacob was stopped in front of a closed door that led toward the upper level of the station.Just he was wondering if he would push it or not, Dark Rose's voice rang from a metal speaker beside the door, "Sir, Jack, would you like to book a ticket for your journey to Dark Inner Circle?"Jacob glanced at the speaker and nodded, "Sure.""It would be 10,000 Gold Coins. Would you like to continue?""Continue," Jacob said without hesitation. He just got over fifty thousand free ZC, so he was quite rich. A few thousand gold coins were nothing but chump change for him.The very next moment, a payment was deducted from his account, and with a mechanic's beep, the metal door was chick opened, revealing an escalator that started moving right after the door was opened.Jacob walked forward without much surprise, and the thick metal door behind him closed automatically.---Unbeknownst to Jacob, a few pairs of eyes were staring at the entrance of the inner circle dark city's station where he had vanished a few moments ago."What now? The target is already left for the inner circle. We don't have the lower dark noble title to enter that place." A cloaked man helplessly stated."Who would've thought our target is also a Dark Noble? This made things complicated. Because even if we had killed him in the dark city, we won't be able to escape alive since killing a dark noble within the dark city is directly punished by death by torture!" Another male voice exclaimed with a hint of terror.A small two feet figure looked at the entrance and sighed ruefully, "Our information is still dormant, and it doesn't matter anymore. We are no longer qualified to claim this target. Only those members in the inner circle are. Let's just report it to our leaders…."---In a secluded alley of the common circle, a small cloaked figure entered with hurried steps like someone was after it.After walking to the end of the alley, which was completely blocked by a brick wall, the figure suddenly moved its hand and pressed it on a particular brick, and like a button, the brick was squeezed inside. Thereby, a faint, crisp voice rang, "Your unique password and Badge Number?"The small figure replied faintly, "I am the Lord of Gutter and Slave of Darkness! Badge Number: Iron Constant-978,359!"Just as his voice trailed off, a faint click was made a small brown door magically materialized in the brick wall.The small figure pushed the brown door, and a dark passage appeared. Without hesitation, he walked into this dark passage, submerging into the darkness.The next moment, the brown door was closed, and just like it appeared, it vanished, turning back into the old brick wall like it wasn't there at all.Walking in the dark passage, the small figure wearing a black mantle saw the light a few meters ahead, and without hesitation, he removed the hood from it and then the white wooden mask, revealing an old gray beard face.If those Senior Grandmaster alchemists were here, they would've instantly recognized this face because it was none other than Senior Grandmaster Potion Alchemist Otto!It would appear after getting robbed by Jacob, Otto also didn't stay in the alchemy guild and appeared in this shoddy place for some reason.Otto walked out of the dark passage and appeared in a spacious hall that was filled with tall bookshelves filled with books. It seemed like a library.Furthermore, there was a huge hourglass filled with black sand hovering in the top center of this library, and the black sand was going upward instead of downward. Strangely, the sand in the lower half of this hourglass wasn't getting lesser, and neither the upper half seemed to get filled. The sand just vanished after it touched the top of the upper half.Otto seemed to be unbothered by this strange phenomenon and directly walked toward the wooden counter of this library, where a green Goblette with a strange pattern under her right eye was looking at Otto impassively.Otto stopped in front of the counter and said impassively, "I would like to change my Star ID as well as my current appearance."The Goblette didn't even flinch at Otto's absurd demand and emotionlessly asked, "How many organizations are you part of, and what are your rankings in them?""I have two organizations' identities, the Killer Skull Society, ranking A-Skull, and the Alchemy Guild's Alchemy Potion Branch, ranking Senior Grandmaster," Otto replied without hesitation.The Goblette was still emotionless as she asked again, "Do you want to get rid of your Brain Chip as well?""Yes.""I would like to recommend the Bronze Class Erase. It will cost 1 million ZC." The Goblette impassively stated.Otto didn't seem surprised by this absurd price since he knew this place was not a place where he could negotiate or raise his opinion on the price. Once the price was given, it was final and unchangeable.So, he flipped his hand. A milky white diamond which was shining like a white star, appeared in his hand, and he placed it on the counter and asked, "Will this be sufficient?"The Goblette didn't agree or deny, as she suddenly pressed her claw-like hand on the white diamond before it shimmered with dark haze, and then it returned to normal.She then looked at Otto and said, "A Growth Type Light Magic Core 1-Star, price, 1.2 million ZC. It is sufficient, and the reaming 200,000 ZC will be transferred to your new Star ID bank account."Otto shook his head as a hint of hatred flashed past his eyes as he said, "I want to use 100,000 ZC to buy a ticket to Epic Plains. And reaming 100,000 to issue an Iron Class Kill Order on someone!"The Goblette nodded and impassively asked, "Star ID?"Otto gritted his teeth as he said with naked killing intent in his eyes, "Faceless Ancient!"

Chapter 263 An Auction Post
﻿While sitting in the cable lift, Jacob decided to check the post about the ritual array materials he posted a week ago in the alchemy exchange market.Since he already got the rainbow dust from Braylon, he could cross this material from his list, and if the blood flower was really the crimson flower he already had, then he only needed three more materials.But it still remained to be seen if the blood flower needed for the array and the one he had were the same or not since he still didn't spot it in the encyclopedia.Now that he was going to the inner circle city, he was hoping to get some peace and could research without getting interrupted again.As he opened the alchemy exchange market interface, he saw his post about the five materials had two replies on it which was quite still better than he was expecting, and he opened them to see if he had any luck.'Search Post by Faceless Ancient: I'm looking for these five (…) materials. Price is negotiable!'Reply 1 (Black Robe Alchemist): I have Nightmare Lilly, but it is 500 years old (Intermediate Type-1). Please contact me if you're interested.'Reply 2 (Flowery King98934): I don't have Night Salve's Poison Magic Core of 9-Star, but I have Silver Rattle Viper's poison magic core of 9-Star. You know where to find me if you're interested.'Jacob frowned as he looked at the Black Robe Alchemist's reply, 'There were no substitute materials written in the ink recipe, which means I can't exchange them at will. I only have one chance at this, so I better prepare all the materials according to the requirements.'Although this nightmare lily is only at intermediate type-1 grade. But if it's still alive, I might be able to cultivate it into advanced rank. It's far better than nothing, I guess. As for this second guy, he might know the information on Night Slave.'With these thoughts in mind, Jacob proceeded as he sent both of them private messages. 'Faceless Ancient to (Black Robe Alchemist): If your Nightmare Lilly is still alive, state your price. I'm also interested in its cultivation method.'Faceless Ancient to (Flowery King98934): I want full information on Night Salve. State your price.'Done writing his responses, he started to browse through the market, especially those auction posts. He was not very hopeful of getting something that could draw his interest.However, Jacob's finger stopped on a particular post with a picture of a palm size silvery rock with a smooth, edgy surface.'Auction Post by Great Earth Minor: I have discovered this unknown mineral. If anyone is interested, please feel free to bid, and if you have information on it, I'll give you a 25% discount on your final bid. Thank you.'Item Type: Mineral (Ore)'Magic Property/ Rank: Unknown'Quantity: 500 Grams'Starting Price: 1 ZC'Reaming Time before the auction end: 1 Hour'Current highest Bidder: Dark Moon of Beast Forest'Bid from (Dark Moon of Beast Forest): 21 ZC'Jacob's eyes were affixed on the picture as he was confirming if his guess was right or wrong.'If I'm not wrong, then this is raw Plutonium and so pure!' Jacob was too familiar with the radioisotopes which were used in making radioactive weapons.Even for someone like him, he didn't dare to play with these radioisotopes despite having worked on them for quite some time because they were simply too dangerous.However, in this world, having these kinds of weapons was like having a trump card. In the champion space, in the end, Jacob tried to buy radioactive minerals like uranium, radium, or even plutonium, but SAAI said they were not available in the rare plains.However, he bought other things that could cause as much damage as a radioactive bomb, which resulted from his lifelong research and obsessions with weaponry.He wanted to make a weapon that he didn't dare to make in his old world before going to the epic plains with those materials. The titan sniper was no longer enough.And now that he saw someone was selling raw plutonium, how could he miss this chance? It would save him a lot of time if he had plutonium.So, without hesitation, he placed a bid of 30 ZC and then contacted this Great Earth Minor.'Faceless Ancient to (Great Earth Minor): If you have more of this mineral, I'm interested in buying them all at the same price as my bid.'Jacob was decisive as he knew finding raw plutonium could be said a stroke of luck, and he was very interested in the location where this guy found it. He might be able to discover even more than plutonium.But he didn't want to push his luck when he didn't even know the guy, so he first decided to see if he had more of it or if he only had that one piece.However, Jacob received a notification when he was done sending a message of Great Earth Minor.'Dark Moon of Beast Forest outbid you. New Bid on Auction Post Number (…) is 31 ZC.'Jacob squinted his eyes, 'Does he know what it is?' His eyes turn cold as he goes back and places a new bid of 50 ZC. He wanted to see if his guess was right or wrong, and he also wanted that piece of plutonium.The very next moment, the same notification rang again, 'Dark Moon of Beast Forest outbid you. New Bid on Auction Post Number (…) is 51 ZC.'Jacob didn't react much this time as he went back and placed a new bid with cold eyes.---Somewhere in the beast forest was an underground workshop that was filled with high-tech equipment.A tall figure in a black lab coat was sitting around a glass table that was filled with all kinds of explosive blueprints like grenades, land mines, and even RPGs.However, the person in a black lab coat was coldly looking at his wrist with its astute foxy eyes.At this moment, a notification rang,'Faceless Ancient outbid you. New Bid on Auction Post Number (…) is 100 ZC.'It instantly spat a curse, "Spineless Bastard, unblock me if you have guts!"

Chapter 264 Go Ahead!
﻿After a small bidding war with Dark Moon of Beast Forest, Jacob ended up placing 350 ZC, and only then did Dark Moon of Best Forest back off. He was adamant about winning this plutonium, so he was keeping an eye on this prick if he played any trick and placed a last-minute bid.Since he still had time, Jacob then decided to look at the star network news since he was just entering the skyway, and it was a fifty-meter-long tunnel which could explain just how thick the wall of the inner circle was.He was interested in seeing how the Freedom Plains were fending off the Dark Beings.There were top ten news on the platform, and the first news instantly drew his attention because of the Star ID,'1. Freedom Lord Golden Sword: We are going through difficult times. The dark armies are upon us; they have already conquered 10% of our territories. Please join the 'United Freedom Army Front' to protect your homes. Merits will be rewarded to heroes and their families!'2. Water Fairy4434: The Dark Begins are wreaking havoc in Ice nation. Where is the United Freedom Army Front?!'3. Goblin Senior943032: Don't go in the United Freedom Army Front. They are using people like cannon folds while those F**k Lords are hiding behind their bunkers and their family members!'4. Cloud of Public: The Dark Beings are getting out of hand, they already conquer 40% of the freedom plains, and millions of people are dead. Where is the United Freedom Army Front? Where is the Freedom Lords? The borders are blocked by the Dark Beings. Will the Freedom Plains be annihilated?'5. ….'The entire start network news was filled with gloom and pleading posts. People were desperately crying for help from the United Freedom Army Front, but they got no response. Even their so-called Freedom Lords were dormant and had vanished after getting beaten black and blue by the Lich King.Not only them but the entire upper echelon of the five nations of the freedom plains had gone missing leaving those helpless natives to fend for themselves, and they were getting killed by the dark beings daily.Jacob emotionlessly looked at all that news and closed the platform since he had seen enough.'Those lords, as well as their loved ones, probably escaped leaving behind these cannon folds to slow down the dark beings. If I'm not wrong, the only way out is the star ocean since the dark beings are blocking their escape routes from land.'They can easily take refuge in the common plains since there is no restriction there or dark beings. Or they can use the Great Star River to head toward higher plains or come here…' Jacob thought impassively.However, deep down, he was feeling a tingle of pain as all those posts flashed through his eyes. His heart grew colder and colder when he thought all those people were dying because he had cleared the trial.'Little Jack, remember, expressing vile thing is easier, and then accomplishing it is difficult, but the true pain rose from the consequences….'Jacob remembered the words he heard from the Old Priest before his lips rose into an icy smile, as all those thoughts turned into nothingness, 'I'll get used to consequences then.'At this moment, his star watch vibrates, snapping him out of his strange state of mind. When he saw it was a message from one of the people he had contacted, he opened it.'Faceless Ancient to (Flowery King98934): I want full information on Night Salve. State your price.'Flowery King98934 (Reply): Are you sure you only want information on Night Slave but not the Silver Rattle Viper's poison magic core?'Jacob coldly wrote a reply, "No."'Flowery King98934 (Reply): Alright, since you only want information, I can give you for free it's not like it's a secret or anything. We alchemists should stick together and help each other whenever we can.'Jacob frowned, and before he could reply, he received another message.'Flowery King98934 (Reply): (Attached File), this thing is too hard to catch. Just be careful.''He really sent it.' Jacob opened it and saw the picture of a pitch-black round ball filled with meter-long spikes at every nook of its surface. It was like a Sea Urchin.'Night Slave (Marine Magic Beast): Found in 2 miles depth of the Western Star Ocean and only activate at night.'Jacob's face sank when he saw it was a marine magic beast, and it was found in the western star ocean, which was in the direction of the wild nation!Still, this information was quite valuable for him, so he still sent Flower King98934 1 ZC as he didn't want someone's charity and no longer bothered replying to him.'I'll wait until I'm done here before making a trip to the Wild Nation.' Jacob thought.At this moment, his lift reached the end of the tunnel, and large metal gates started to slide upward, revealing a large metropolis behind. But it was not as busy as the common circle of the city.However, Jacob felt refreshed when he breathed the air and was astounded by it, 'There is something different about this place.' He thought while looking at the paved and spotlessly clean streets of the inner circle while people walking here were mostly not wearing any cloaks like the common circle.However, Jacob's attention was drawn by his star watch again when he received another reply from the reaming two.'Faceless Ancient to (Great Earth Minor): If you have more of this mineral, I'm interested in buying them all at the same price as my bid.'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Do you know what it is and where it is used? I can give you a 25% discount as promised.'Jacob frowned after reading this reply, 'He didn't mention anything about having more. It seemed he had more, but he didn't want to sell it.'So, Jacob used another approach as he replied, "Sell me 10 KG of it, and I'll tell you."'Great Earth Minor (Reply): You're too greedy! I should make a deal with the Dark Moon of Beast Forest instead!'Jacob coldly sneered, 'So, you want to play this game?'He replied decisively, "Go ahead!"

Chapter 265 Black Robe Alchemist Reply
﻿Jacob didn't receive any more messages from the Great Earth Minor after he sent 'Go ahead.' However, a few seconds later, that prick retracted his auction post, which could only mean he had made some kind of deal with the Dark Moon of Beast Forest.Jacob coldly chuckled when he received 175 ZC from Great Earth Minor as a ramification because he retracted the auction post with bidding.Canceling an active auction post naturally has a ramification: the seller has to pay half the amount of the current highest bid to the bidder.Although Jacob really wanted that plutonium, it doesn't mean he can't do without it. He already had materials for his needs to create a new weapon; the plutonium could've made the process faster.Furthermore, Jacob knew no one in the rare plains could handle plutonium better than him, and those guys would soon regret it if they started experimenting with it without prior knowledge.With this thought in mind, Jacob sent a message to Great Earth Minor before he closed the interface without caring about the reply. The lift also stopped at this moment, and the door slid open."Welcome to Dark Inner Circle of Dark City!" Dark Rose's mechanical voice rang.Jacob stood up and walked into the new station, which was the same as the common circle, and soon, he exited the station.However, when Jacob was about to hail of taxi, his eyes suddenly moved toward a particular direction, and he just happened to see a few cloaked figures looking in his direction.As if they were startled by Jacob's sudden gaze, they instantly started to move as if it was coincident.'Who is monitoring my movement?' Jacob knew when he was being monitored, and he was feeling this from the moment he left the alchemy guild building.But he ignored it since those were small fries, but now the moment he exited, someone was there waiting for him.'Well, whoever it was, they won't pester me in the alchemy guild.' Jacob stopped caring about them, hailed a taxi, and headed into the alchemy guild in the inner circle.The Alchemy guild in the inner circle was quite different from the common circle, the biggest difference being they didn't conduct entrance tests there but only did business like selling their products.The alchemists here were all lower-rank dark nobles, but their guild ranks were below senior grandmasters. For some strange reason, Braylon was the only Senior Grandmaster present in this place.Furthermore, most of these alchemists were quite loyal to Braylon, but the thing was going changed as Jacob walked into the building and directly headed toward the workshop area."Who are you? Stop right there!" A cold voice sounded when Jacob was about to take the elevator toward the upper floors.Jacob coldly looked at a handsome elf approaching him with an unkind expression.The elf coldly said with squinted eyes, "Who are you? This area is restricted to just alchemists! Get out of here before I call the guards!"Jacob didn't move and merely tapped his finger on his wrist before a projection materialized. It was the projection of the Alchemy Guild Badge, and below this badge were written golden words, 'Guild Leader (Dark City).'The elf was shocked when he saw the guild leader badge, which was supposed to be with Braylon, had appeared on this mysterious guy.His eyes turned ruthless as magic power suddenly started to gather around his palm, "Do you think I'm a child and followed by this fake badge? You have dug your own grave by using this fake badge!"However, before he could use his magic power, he was rooted in his place because Jacob somehow appeared right behind him, and his finger was right where the elf's heart was.Jacob's impassive voice rang at this moment, "I will repeat this only once. Braylon has given me his position and will no longer come here. I will not interfere with the guild matter and let them run as they were running before."Unless the guild building is about to get destroyed, no one is allowed to approach Braylon's old workshop, which is mine, from now on. Because if anyone did, I'll chop off their limbs before throwing them out. Do I make myself clear?"The elf felt icy, although his entire body was sweating profusely, and as just as Jacob's voice trailed off, he again appeared right where he was standing.The elf felt deadly chills as he saw the masked man standing in front of him as if nothing had happened. "Do you want to leave behind your limb before you decide to scram?" Jacob coolly questioned.The elf then quickly snapped out of his stupor, "I-I… I'll scram!"Without wasting even a second, he ran away. He had never felt so close to death before and didn't want to stay to see if Jacob was just kidding.After getting rid of the imbecile, Jacob directly headed toward the top floor where the best workshop in this building was located, Braylon's magic smith workshop!Since Braylon didn't think that he would be forfeiting his position this morning when he went to meet Jacob, everyone in his workshop was the same.There were many equipments and materials. Even some blueprints were lying on the study table. Those blueprints should be Braylon's current projects.There was also a large bookshelf with over a hundred books about magic smiting.Now everything belonged to Jacob as he also had acquired everything in Braylon's space ring as well.Jacob was quite satisfied with this magic smith workshop, and without wasting more time, he continued his study. He wasn't planning on leaving before he would be a full fledge Senior Grandmaster Magic Smith as well as get rid of his reserve alchemist status!After what happened with Gunnar, he didn't want the tragedy to repeat itself with Alchemy Guild.But before he could start, he received a reply from Black Robe Alchemist.'Faceless Ancient to (Black Robe Alchemist): If your Nightmare Lilly is still alive, state your price. I'm also interested in its cultivation method.'Black Robe Alchemist (Reply): I only have one Nightmare Lilly, and it just happened to be planted in my herb garden. However, I'm hiding in the Freedom Plains, and the situation is not optimal for any kind of travel for obvious reasons. So, if you want the Nightmare Lilly, you have to come to my place!'

﻿The bare-chest man stood in front of a blazing forge, as he was filled with sweat which showed the carved muscles on his pale skin even more apparent. He was holding long smith tongs and impassively looking at the piece of some metal within the forge.The strange thing was, not only was this piece of metal wasn't turned crimson with heat, but it was glowing in dark blue color.This man was naturally non-other than Jacob.Jacob suddenly the tongs and pulled the dark blue metal from the blazing forge, and he quenched it into a metal barrel filled with a glossy blue liquid prepared beforehand.However, upon pacing the heated metal into that blue liquid, there was no smoke at all. On the contrary, the entire blue liquid suddenly stirred before its quantity started to drop, as the full barrel of this blue liquid was now getting lower and lower until nothing was left.The only thing that was left was the dark blue metal which was now not only glowing but there were faint sky-blue markings on it.Jacob didn't seem surprised as he moved the tongs and then placed the dark blue metal on the big anvil. He then picked up a black hammer which was actually filled with strange white markings, and right in the center of this hammer was embedded a small white gem.Without hesitation, he started to smith the dark blue metal, and every time he hit dark blue metal, the white gem flashed, and so the white marking on the hammer and a small shockwave was created.However, Jacob's strikes were somewhat special as they did not contain just blunt force but precise control and focus. A different kind of shock wave was created every time his hammer hit the metal. Even the sound was somewhat different from the other strike.After smiting the dark blue metal for fifteen minutes, Jacob finally stopped and looked at the long dark blue blade with sky blue patterns, which seemed like the marking on the black hammer.The next moment, a 'T' shape hilt appeared, and the handle was embedded with another small white gem. This was prepared prior before he made the blade.Without hesitation, he combined the sword hilt with the sword blade, and something amazing happened.'Click…'The white gemstone suddenly shimmered with a clicking sound, and the sky-blue pattern on the blade began to glow brightly. The dark blue marking on the blade started to spread on the hilt at this moment like roots and covered it entirely.Jacob looked with great anticipation at those markings spreading on the hilt, and the white gemstone was the only place they seemed to be avoiding.At this moment, the white gem suddenly turned cracked, and within a few moments, it turned into white power.However, the sky-blue marking was now completely engraved on the blade and hilt, creating a strange pattern.Jacob didn't seem surprised by the white gem's current state, and he flipped his hand before another white gem appeared. He enclosed the gem in the position of the previous white gem, and like a magnet, it instantly clicked on the empty spot."End the recording and send it back for final verification." Jacob impassively commanded as the faint white glow on his arm flashed brightly before a projection appeared of an interface.'

Didn't this mean all the information on Type-2 also can't be accessed?'Jacob checked the shops, and just as he thought, no type-2 knowledge was released, which could only mean his guess was likely right.Because whenever he achieved a certain threshold, new information would always be released by the White Sage, but now he got nothing but a NOTE telling him to head to the Epic Plains.At this moment, he also received a new identity badge which was branded with the alchemy guild's sigil, the blazing red flame rising from an eight-legged golden cauldron written under a silver ribbon with golden letters '1-Star Epic Alchemist (Faceless Ancient).''At least this badge could be useful within the Epic Plains.' Jacob's expression returned to his usual cold self, 'I finally absorbed everything except Type-1 universal magic manual.'Now I can finally start preparing for my departure from the Rare Plains. In contrast, there are still eighteen remaining months left before that woman's deadline approaches.'I can either go with the alchemy guild entourage or AOWL them. I'll decide after acquiring information about the journey toward the Epic Plains. I need to start my manufacturing and end it in one month, and then I'll make a round trip to the freedom plains in six or seven months. Time is quite short, I guess.'Jacob thought as eighteen months had passed since he had taken over as the Dark City's Alchemy Guild Leader, and now he was finally an official member of the Guild.But he was still far from being done with the rare plains, so without wasting more time, he started to take out all kinds of gun parts filled with those strange patterns like on the hammer and newly forged Advance Type-1 magic sword!

Chapter 267 Bronze Invitation
Unknown location, above the sky, was flying a two-meter gray eagle with a wing span of over five meters, flying at a terrifying speed.On top of this eagle were standing two figures, without any fear of blowing away with the wind current. On the contrary, the wind seemed to be not even touched their bodies as if they were corporeal.One was a tall, middle-aged man with purple skin and giving off a peaceful aura.However, the purple skin beautiful woman with a fierce expression beside him, who had a great resemblance to him, was giving off a completely different vibe than him.At this moment, the woman frowned slightly as she looked at her wrist, and a small projection with one notification appeared. 'Your Bronze Invitation (Faceless Ancient) has become a 1-Star Epic Alchemist!'The Bronze Initiation Benefits (BIB) has been activated!'Bronze Invitation Benefits: You (Amiable Monk Fish) will now receive 40% of Faceless Ancient earnings made through the Alchemy Guild channels. You have the right to issue 3 Guild Missions every year to Faceless Ancient. You have the right to revoke the Faceless Ancient bronze invitation anytime by paying a 10 Million ZC process fee.'(NOTE: The Bronze Invitation Benefits are only valid from 1-Star Epic Alchemist to 9-Star Epic Alchemist Rank!)'A hint of surprise flashed past Ellie's blue eyes, reading the invitation, 'So fast? It seemed I had underestimated this guy. Not only was he capable of robbing and snatching #1's guild leader position eighteen months ago, but his alchemy talent is also top-notch.'He's far superior to #1 to #11. But he's also quite rebellious and might hold it against me if he knew what the bronze invitation actually was. Although I didn't waste my bronze invitation on him, he's not like those obedient dogs.'I have to put a tight leash on him once he comes here and show him the true difference between rare plains and epic plains. Once he's completely under my control, he'll earn me big profits.'Calmness returned to her eyes as the small projection vanished.However, she was startled when Nelsen was looking at her with this amusing grin on his face.He said teasingly, "Hehe, my little girl, who are you scheming against this time? Tell your daddy quickly."Ellie threw a fierce punch right at his face with pursed lips, "Get out of my face, old geezer!"However, Nelsen kept grinning and wasn't panicked by that punch at all. He merely moved his finger between his face and the punch, and the powerful punch was instantly stopped in its track.Nelsen sighed ruefully, "You're so willful and brutal. You even punched your old daddy and tried to kill him? Sometimes I even wonder if I have birthed a wolf…""Shut up! And get out of my face before I kill this little rid of yours!" Ellie instantly snapped as a powerful aura started to release from her.The eagle suddenly trembled in fear as if he understood what Ellie just said.Nelsen knew when to stop with his little shenanigans, so he stood straight again and clicked his tongue in annoyance, "Tsk, tsk, can you stop with threats of destroying my things? You were so cute when you were little."Ellie pursed her lips and spat, "If I don't threat you with your things, you don't know when to stop with your childish behavior!""Heh, but you know I love my baby girl the most," Nelsen said matter-of-factly."Hmph, this won't work anymore!" Ellie snorted, but the coldness in her eyes visibly lessened.Nelsen merely chuckled as he knew Ellie the best, "Alright, tell me, is that really BIB there? And you used it on that Faceless Ancient you were telling me about?"Ellie didn't hide it since she knew there was no point in hiding it since Nelsen wasn't a fool as he always pretended to be, and he could easily see through her."Yes. It is the same person.""Did he ask you what a bronze invitation was or just accept it without asking any questions?" He asked again."He asked me, and I didn't tell him what it was. What it had to do with anything?" She questioned with somewhat narrowed eyes. She knew Nelsen wouldn't ask so many questions unless he wasn't interested in the topic.Especially if a stranger from Rare Plains was involved."You did well by not telling him. Or he would never have accepted your invitation." Nelsen chuckled as he commented."Do you know something?" Ellie's interest was now piqued."How about you tell me how much you love your daddy, and I'll tell you ten." Nelsen instantly pulled his mischievous grin again.Ellie's serious expression was replaced by exasperation, and she threw a vicious kick at Nelsen's rear, but it was again blocked by Nelsen's finger."Hahaha… I got you again!" Nelsen guffawed again.However, he quickly said when he saw Ellie was really going to cast a spell on the eagle, "Alright! Stop! I'll tell you!"Ellie then gave him a death glare but still stopped, but she was circulating the magic on the tip of her fingers, clearly ready to use a spell the moment Nelsen pulled his nasty smile.Nelsen sighed ruefully, "I truly spoil you rotten! OK, stop, I'm telling you! It's about Lucy!"Ellie, who was about to throw a spell without caring about the height, instantly stopped when she heard that name."What about that tramp?" She asked with a dangerous glint in her eyes.Nelsen sighed in relief when he saw she finally stopped and revealed without getting derailed this time."From my sources, I heard the official members of the bank in the rare plains are getting restless and guess the place of their activities?"Ellie asked with squinted eyes, "Dark city?""Not just dark city but the inner circle of the dark city, and all the activities are happening right around our alchemy guild in there!" Nelsen coolly revealed.Ellie was surprised since she merely shot a blind arrow, but she never thought it would hit the bullseye!"Don't tell that old tramp is after Faceless Ancient? But why? And how did she know about him anyway? Are you tricking me?" She was extremely intelligent, and she easily guessed that it was about Jacob since the topic started with him.Nelsen chuckled, "I don't have any reason to sow discord between you two when I know you guys are like fire and water. She most likely after him. I think it's time I tell you another thing about this Faceless Ancient character!"Ellie was stumped by this!

Chapter 268 Three Things
Dark Inner Circle, Alchemy Guild, top floor,Almost all the important figures of the alchemy guild of the dark inner circle were gathered here. The atmosphere was extremely gloomy and apprehensive as all of them were looking at each other with fear and agitation."Old Sixth, do you know why we are being summoned by Guild Leader?" A gnome asked in a whispering voice while looking at the brown goblin."How the hell do I know? That tyrant had never bothered with us after coming here, but now all of a sudden, he's summing us. No matter how you look at it, it's extremely unsettling!" The goblin snapped.Almost all of them were talking in this manner, and the top was the same.There were three people in particular who had ghastly pale expressions and were isolated by the other alchemists for some reason. There was another thing common about them, which was each of them was missing an arm.One of them was kobold as he asked the elf beside him grimly, "What do you think?"The elf with a missing arm gritted his teeth in hatred while replying, "How the hell did it matter what I think? Just don't provoke that monster, and we'll be fine. I don't want to lose another arm!"The kobold with a missing arm, as well as a rat face demi-human who was also missing an arm, also gnashed their teeth in hatred and pain.These three still remembered that day like it was yesterday when they found out that Braylon was replaced by a new guy and went there to confirm it despite the elf's warning, who met Jacob at the entrance of the lift.They just wanted to know why Braylon was being replaced and what kind of attitude the new guild leader had. In truth, these three were Braylon's most loyal dogs and were also involved in a good deal of calumniation and denigration of many fellow members of the guild.Braylon was always busy with research, so these three had gained quite a power behind his back, and Braylon didn't seem to care about it either.That's why they had gone to Jacob to inquire about why Braylon, who had no plan on leaving just in the morning, was now abruptly replaced by him.However, not to mention questioning Jacob, the moment they came a meter close to his workshop, Jacob's figure appeared like a shadow, and without giving them any chance, he directly chopped off their limbs and threw them out.Many who were paying attention to this new guild leader were gobsmacked by this turn of events, and they finally understood that the elf early wasn't joking at all about the new guild leader's brutal warning.From that day on, no one dared to approach Jacob's workshop, even if they had a thousand guts. As for these three guys, they became the beaten dogs and were instantly isolated by all of them because of their past conduct.Since their limbs were cut off, they knew their life as an alchemist was as good as over, and they couldn't leave the place either since they were too used to the comfortable life of the inner circle's alchemy guild.Now, 20 months had passed since Jacob closed himself in the workshop, but today they all received summon from him, which made almost everyone scared. Still, they didn't dare to ignore his summoning.If Braylon was someone who liked to manipulate others by putting up an amiable front, then Jacob was like a tyrant who didn't care about his image or their feelings at all. He was terrifyingly powerful for them all, not be mention extremely ruthless. This was enough to keep them all in check."Click…"The door was clicked open before a tall figure clad in black entered the hall, and everyone quickly stood up with sweat beaded on their foreheads because this person was none other than their mysterious Guild Leader.Jacob was wearing his usual black outfit. However, if someone looked closely, there were jet-black markings all over his long black windbreaker. Only someone with extremely good sight could tell the difference between the faint shade of the color.Furthermore, Jacob was wearing a faceless black mask, and not even his amber eyes weren't visible to anyone, as if he was completely blind. Not even his skin was visible, as his hands were now covered with the same kind of gloves as his windbreaker. Lastly, his head was covered by a long hood, and he looked just like a mysterious killer.Everyone felt chills just seeing him walking toward the high chair at the very front of the table. They were all used to not wearing any mask in this place, but Jacob was simply too mysterious.Jacob walked onto his chair and sat down before his impassive voice rang, "Sit."Everyone bowed their head first before they sat down on their chairs, but their heart rate was wild, and no one knew who Jacob was looking at right now since his eyes were no longer visible. Even his face mask was barely visible under that long hood."Today, I summon everyone to discuss three things!" Jacob spoke again and didn't mind their lack of response; he actually liked this silent environment."First, I will be leaving the Dark City soon, which means the Guild Leader position will be vacant. So, I will give you guys one week to become a Senior Grandmaster. I will invigilate the test personally. Or I'll choose someone else from the common circle branch if none of you manage to pass. Is that clear?"Everyone was dumbfounded by this revelation and looked at Jacob with disbelief."W-why?... NO! I mean, why did you want to leave?" A wolf face orc stuttered and asked with great difficulty."Do I need to answer you about my matter?" Jacob coolly asked without any intent behind his words.But to the orc, he nearly kneeled down to beg for forgiveness, "I-I… for…forgive me, Guild Leader!" He lowered his head and didn't dare to raise it anymore.The others also kept their curiosity to themselves now and didn't ask for the reason.A goblin spoke at this moment, "C-can I ask if there are any particular requirements for the position like our professions?"This question did not pry into any of Jacob's matters, so everyone was hoping to get an answer for this and also looked at the goblin in admiration to be able to speak in front of this scary guy.Jacob wasn't unreasonable, and he answered, "There are none. I don't know why there hadn't been any Vice Guild Leader in this place or any senior grandmaster, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with that prick Braylon."I'm not like him, and I think it's time for Guild to return to its track. I have 100 permanent member slots. You guys are 59 Grandmasters, and the first one to achieve Senior Grandmaster Rank will be the Guild and get one slot. The second one will be the vice guild leader and also receive one slot."As for the remaining 98 slots, if all of you guys are able to become senior grandmasters in a week, I'll give you one each. You guys can think of it as a competition." Everyone's eyes brightened, and their heart raced when they heard what Jacob was planning to do. Jacob's image instantly raised in their heart. Although he was tyrannical, he wasn't petty like Braylon.Just as he said, Braylon never allowed them to enter Senior Grandmaster ranks because they were all lower rank dark nobles and fairy young, nor he ever gave them any permanent member slot.In comparison, the common circle guild was filled with old guys who had no potential at all.He even threatened them ambiguously that they were not ready to be senior grandmasters and might lose their membership if they tried to take that step.It was probably the reason that there were so few permanent members in rare plains. Braylon probably has an influence on the other guilds in the freedom plains as well.However, Jacob was now telling them to become one, and he was even giving them the positions they deserved. So, they were quite grateful and thrilled to go prepared for the test.Even if they were not confident, they would still try it since it was a very precious opportunity.Only those three armless idiots were filled with regret.Jacob then speaks again, not caring about their enthusiastic expressions, "Second, I want you guys to use your connection and search for three types of materials for me. Anyone who found any one of these materials will get three permanent member slots which means you can use them on yourself or your friends. I won't care."The hall regained deadly silence again as they looked at Jacob as if he was a god of fortune.Jacob continued as he expected this much, "Third, I want information about Star Ocean, especially beyond the southern star ocean, which is the uncharted territory."If I deem your information useful, I'll give you one slot as a reward. But you only have one week to do these three things before I leave the dark city. You all dismiss!"

Chapter 269 Vice President Call
After Jacob's announcement, the Alchemy Guild started to buzz with activities as all those Grandmasters madly started to prepare for the upcoming test as well as they used every contact to search for the materials and information Jacob wanted.The three types of materials Jacob made them search were naturally the White, Assassin Parasite Bug's Blood, Night Salve's Poison Magic Core, and Nightmare Lilly.The blood flower turned out to be the same blood flower required for the enslavement ritual array. So, Jacob now already has two materials, and as long as he gets his hand on the remaining three, he will start the process of taming the Brain Hunter.Jacob knew these dark nobles were not without connections, so he decided to use them by giving them enough motivation. The permanent member slots cost him nothing, and they were useless once he exited the rare plains.So, he wasn't losing anything by giving those useless slots as rewards to them, and he didn't care about controlling those useless guys like Braylon.Even if they didn't manage to get their hands on any of the materials, he already knows where to find two of them, while the Assassin Parasite Bug could pose some problems.But he was confident in finding it since he knew what environment they resided in.He would at least get information on the star ocean from all of this, which was as important as those materials. He still wanted to avoid traveling with the alchemy guild entourage if he could.At this moment, Jacob was sitting in his workshop, which was now clean and spotless, as if it were not in use for twenty months.He was looking at his star watch interface, and a message box was opened, and he was reading some unread messages which he didn't bother when he was busy. He even put his star watch away so he won't be disturbed.'Faceless Ancient to (Great Earth Minor): Go Ahead! (20 months ago)'Faceless Ancient to (Great Earth Minor): If you encounter any problem you're your breathing, don't come begging me to save you! (20 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): What do you mean?? (20 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): ??? (20 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Fucking Idiot! (20 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Hello! If you're still interested in our deal, I can forget about our past transition. (17 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Hey buddy, I was thinking about your offer lately, and I would be happy to work with you! Please reply for further discussion! (16 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Man, please reply if you want the silver ore. I can even give you a discount, and I have 13 KG! (16 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Alright, I was wrong back then and shouldn't have believed that prick Dark Moon. I'm suffering from a strange breathing problem, and my lungs are always on fire, and with time past, it is getting worse! So, please help me. I'll fully cooperate with you! (15 months ago)'Great Earth Minor (Reply): Why aren't you replying?? (15 months ago)...Jacob looked at hundreds if not thousands of unread messages from Great Earth Minor, except for the first ten or twenty messages; the reaming was filled with pleading and begging as he was suffering from a strange illness that was getting intensified by the day.His lips curled up in an icy smile, 'If you work with plutonium without even knowing what it is, especially if you have a large amount, then the alpha particles will kill your lungs at terrifying speed, which will cause scarring of the lungs, leading to further lung disease and at the end terminal lung cancer.'I wasn't sure if cancer could occur in this world since the species here had very powerful immune systems. So, I was merely firing in the darkness, but it seemed diseases would find their way.'But still, to get rare being effective by plutonium's radiation, it should be at least over 5 points while it would take 10-point radiation to effect an extraordinary. In any case, he had to be exposed to more than twenty kg of plutonium to reach any aforementioned results.' Jacob thought as he was calculating as if Great Earth Minor was his experiment subject.His eyes shimmered darkly, 'Well, I don't need it anymore, but having it with me will not hurt, I guess. Besides, I'm really immune to radiation of over 10 points, so my immunity to harmful objects is legit. Now I just need to test slave objects. Anyhow, l should contact this guy now before he dies with all that plutonium buried somewhere.'Jacob types a message, 'Give me your location.' And then sent it before he opened another message which he was from the Black Robe Alchemist.'Faceless Ancient to (Black Robe Alchemist): I'll reach out when I'm done. Keep the Nightmare Lilly safe for me. The price is not an issue. (20 months ago)'Black Robe Alchemist (Reply): Sure, it's not like I can go anywhere with those damn corpses running amok outside. (20 months ago)'Black Robe Alchemist (Reply): I'm texting you to inform you that I'm going to flee from my base because the situation is not looking good for the freedom plains. But I'm leaving the Nightmare Lilly in my herb garden as well as its cultivation method buried right underneath it. So, if you're still interested, you can pay me, and I'll give you the location of my abandoned base, and you can retrieve it from there. (12 months ago)'Jacob narrowed his eyes when he saw this message, 'It could be a scam, but I guess if I didn't get any luck in the dark city or the beast forest, then it's still better than nothing.Jacob then replied to him, 'How much?' and then closed the interface.He then looked at the brightly lit city outside and thought, 'I should take a stroll in the market, especially the ship company. I need a fast ship to travel in the star ocean, and its size should be enough to put in my pendant.'However, he pulled out of his thoughts when his star watch started to vibrate and when he looked at the caller's Star ID. He frowned deeply."Amiable Monk Fish wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!"'What did she want?' Jacob was still on guard against this woman, and her timing of the call was simply too impeccable as he had just exited his seclusion, so he was not going to believe that it was a coincidence. He thought of ghosting her since he was no longer a reserve member, but then he thought about that ride to the epic plains in sixteen months. He still needed to be in her good books until he made the final decision about his traveling problem.So, he accepted the call, and Ellie wearing a white veil, and silvery robes, appeared. She was sitting behind a desk, just like the last time she called him."Vice president, what do I owe the honor?" Jacob coolly stated.Ellie looked at Jacob's same outfit as the last time, and her eyes shimmered strangely. But she wasn't in the mood to have a chit-chat after talking to her father. So, she got straight to business."Foremost, congratulation on becoming an Epic Alchemist in such a short amount of time. Consider the ten thousand ZC before you reward, and you can spend them freely now."Jacob scoffed in his heart, hearing this with coldness creeping in his eyes, 'So, she was keeping an eye on me, huh? As for that ZC, if I hadn't robbed Braylon, I'm afraid those ten thousand was only enough to practice either potion, pill, or magic smiting to Senior Grandmaster rank. Yet she had the nerve to said I can use it as I pleased?'Still, he impassively replied, "Thank you for your generosity, Vice President."Ellie nodded before her eyes turned sharp, "Second, when were you going to tell me that you were the champion of the rare plains?"Jacob wasn't the least shocked by this as he already knew this woman could learn this from the Guild President as well since a Gunnar can. But it was also quite clear that the President only decided to reveal it to her now, which means the President had some motive to hide it from her before."What would you do if you knew? Last time I recon, I'm not obliged to report to you about anything other than guild matter, and that is also under the condition that I'm under the suspicion of some crime against the guild." Jacob emotionlessly uttered.Ellie was lost for words when she heard Jacob's valid refute and narrowed her eyes coldly while looking at the hooded figure. She never thought he would dare to refute, but it wasn't out of her expectation either.Still, she didn't push the matter since it was not what she had contacted him for; she asked coldly, "Fair enough. Then tell me, were you contacted by someone named Rich Winter Lady?"Surprised flashed past Jacob's eyes for the first time!
62c5b2942708fd12a9ad975e


Chapter 270 A Mission
 Jacob could feel the great hostility from Ellie's voice for the Rich Winter Lady.'Something is going on here.' Jacob thought before he replied, "I was indeed contacted by Bank Manager Rich Winter Lady before your call, and I was given the same offer the Vice Guild Leader gave me."Jacob decided to reveal this information as there wasn't anything worth hiding about it. Besides, the Rich Winter Lady gave him a bad feeling when he rejected her offer again and again.So now Ellie was bringing her all of a sudden could shed some light on this matter. He never believed that he was out of the woods after he rejected her offer, and he was most likely right.Furthermore, Ellie's naked hostility toward her draws Jacob's interest even more.'So, that bitch somehow found out about me giving that brainless idiot one million ZC to revoke Faceless Ancient's membership and contacted him even before me. I won't be surprised if that greedy bastard told her himself and earned himself more money.' Ellie's eyes went icy cold when he heard Jacob confirming it, and she asked, "Why did you reject her offer?"Jacob nonchalantly replied, "Because I found it lacking."Ellie narrowed her eyes as she clearly didn't believe what Jacob had just said. Still, she felt better. Because if he had accepted Lucy's offer, she would have wasted one million ZC on her arch-enemy, and she most likely has flown into madness."Since you decided to join the alchemy guild, I can assure you that it was the best decision of your life. However, you have offended Lucy in the process, and I can assure you that she is the prettiest person in existence."From my sources, I have discovered the Universal Mercenaries were snooping around the Alchemy Guild in the inner circle. From what I know about Lucy, it's most likely her who wanted you dead!" Ellie revealed.Jacob's eyes narrowed behind his mask as he suddenly remembered those watchful eyes he felt when he was coming to the inner circle.'So, those guys were the reserve members of the bank commission by that woman. She must've put a lavish reward on my head to compel so many people to take risks in the dark city.' He thought, but he wasn't worried about it as well.Right now, he was afraid of no one in the rare plains, and only Epic tier beings could pose a threat to him or the Star Ocean. If he wanted to massacre in the dark city and then leave, he knew no one was capable of stopping him.But he won't be going to tell Ellie about it because he could tell she had something else in mind, as she won't be contacting him just to warn him out of the kindness of her heart.He said, "What should I do then? I'm sure Vice Leader has some good suggestions for me."Ellie was somewhat surprised when she heard Jacob's voice contain no anxiety despite knowing he was being targeted by the Bank Manager of the Epic Plains.'Dad was right, someone who can pass a plain trial alone can indeed not be so simple, and I need to be more careful when dealing with him.' She thought gravely.Ellie then finally spoke, "If it were someone else, I would've suggested they remain in the guild building. But you are someone who can complete a plain trial, so I have a different suggestion for you."No, this is not a suggestion, but consider it a personal mission from me. If you choose to accept it, you will get half of your reward first. But if you reject it, I won't hold it against you."'Here it comes.' Jacob's eyes shimmered in derision, but his voice was impassive when he asked, "I would like to hear about the mission and the rewards before making my decision."Ellie nodded in understanding before she stated, "It's quite simple. I want you to kill as many reserve or official universal members as possible. With each head, I will reward you with 1000 ZC. You just need to send me the video to claim the reward."As for the other half of the reward, which I will give you if you decide to accept the mission, it is a Basic Type-2 Magic Rifle Blueprint! The choice is yours now."Ellie was full of confidence when she offered the blueprint of a Basic Type-2 magic rifle because she thought Jacob wouldn't be able to resist it since he was an Alchemist.However, Jacob's words made her confident expression clouded as he coldly said, "I can't use Basic Type-2 Magic Rifle Blueprint since the rare plains lack materials, so it would be useless to me. I'm a very practical person Vice Leader, so how about you send me the map of Star Ocean which has the routes to rare plains and epic plains, as well as the map of the Epic Plains, and I'll accept this mission."Ellie squinted her eyes as she instantly understood what Jacob was after, "Do you want to travel in toward the epic plains alone?""No, I just want to have such an option. Because if I start killing mercenaries, especially the permanent members, Bank Manager Lucy might not take it kindly if she found out it was me."Besides, I need to leave the protection of Dark City if I want to kill those mercenaries, and I can't leave rare plains instantly, either. In contrast, your voyage is still sixteen months far."I just want to have another way out, and I don't think these maps would cost you anything at all," Jacob said matter-of-factly.Now that he got the chance to exploit the vendetta between Ellie and Lucy, he won't hesitate to ask for what he really needs. If he could get the map of star ocean routes that lead to the epic plains as he got in the common plains, he doesn't have to wait for anyone or rush things or even collect any information at all. He can leave whenever he wants to leave.Now the question was if Ellie's vendetta was deep enough with Lucy that she could allow this to happen or not.Ellie was quite astute, so she also guessed Jacob's motives, but she knew she was still in control as long as she had a bronze invitation in place so Jacob couldn't escape her grasp as long as he didn't want to get kicked out of the guild.But she won't tell him that yet and hold this trump card hidden for as long as she can.Right now, she wanted to make Lucy indignant, and Jacob could really achieve it. So, she nodded in agreement, "Alright, I'll give you both maps!"
