Chapter 41 Vague Encounter
﻿Jacob quickly sprang into action as a container appeared in his hand and he quickly collect the Arrow Tail Jaguar's blood before it was absorbed into the ground.His Infinity Pendant's space was limited and that big jaguar's carcass can't fit in, that was why he was caring two containers inside to collect blood and heart, so they won't go to waste.Furthermore, the infinity pendant was the perfect place to store these things because it could keep them in the same condition they were stored. This was the biggest advantage he had of this storage space, and he wanted to increase it, so he could also store Pig Head inside if needed.Notwithstanding, he quickly collected the sufficient amount of blood he needed for the extraction process and also cut open the jaguar's chest and acquired its heart, and throw it into the blood-filled container as well before storing it away."Sigh, finally now I don't have to worry about anything…" Jacob breathed in relief before a cold drop fell on his head and he looked at the dark sky.Within a few moments, heavy rain poured down and wash away all the blood on the group and completely soaked both of them.Jacob couldn't help but closed his eyes and enjoy this rain shower after a very, very long time, and a distant memory surfaced in his mind,---It was a dark, rainy night when a middle-aged man was dragged into the rain by a beautiful woman as she laughs lovingly with elation while pulling this middle-aged man around despite his burly build.The middle-aged man helplessly said, "Hope, let's go inside. What if you catch a cold!"Hope giggles in excitement and retorted, "JS, you're always cooped up in that shitty lab of yours, or tanning fields. You have to enjoy nature something and make happy memories!"JS replied with a faint smile and pull Hope into her embrace, "Really, I guess you're right. But what if I forget? Don't you need to do something to make it an everlasting memory?"Hope wrapped her slender arms around JS's muscular neck and looked lovingly into his eyes and seductively said, "We have never done 'it' in rain…"---Rumble…Jacob's eyes snapped open with a hint of melancholy as the thunderclap rang.He looked at Pig Head, who was standing beside him like a log, as his blood was gushing out from that deep wound on his chest and washing away with the rain.A bottle filled with black liquid appeared in his hand and he gave it to Pig Head, "Drink it, at this rate you'll bleed to death."He had stored some black liquid just for emergencies like these before moving out.After drinking it, the blood from the injury suddenly stopped, and the wound was mending, but very slowly."Let's go back and pick up the carcass. This rain won't stop anytime soon, and there might be some predators appearing in this rain soon." Jacob's command coolly and they walk toward the hideout.Although most animals will hide when rained, this place was not ordinary, so he didn't want to put his life at risk, and he already got what he wanted, so there wasn't any need to be greedy.To make sure Pig Head's wound won't get worse, they move at a slow pace, and they took triple the time to reach the hideout position from the time they travel before.However, Jacob's footstep came to an abrupt halt at this moment while his eyes narrowed into slits.'Thum… Thumm…' 'Footsteps?' His hearing has become extremely sensitive after his first injection and even in this rain he could hear small sounds from a few tens of meters away and these sounds were extremely startling.Jacob knit his eyebrows together because these large footsteps were also approaching his hideout and at a quick pace, and if he tried to enter the hideout now, he'll meet the owners of those footsteps before he could close the door."Let's hide." Jacob quickly commanded Pig Head, and they slowly creep behind the large tree only a few meters away from the hideout.Jacob wanted to wait and let whoever it was passed before going back since they won't be able to find the hidden door.However, he soon saw something which left him in horror and gobsmacked. Even from his place, he saw two large cocked heads appearing from the trees, and they were extremely tall!Even from his place, he could see those two towering figures and his heart trembled when a word came to his mind, 'Giants!'Instantly, more information flooded what he read from Decker's journal, and he felt goosebumps.'Could they be mountain giants, a rarer race, and also the ones who Decker stole the Immortika from? But how did they appear here, so far from their home and so close to this hideout? Did that bastard make some kind of mistake and reveal himself?!' Jacob suddenly felt like killing Decker again in the curliest way possible.Because if what he guessed was true, then he was in massive trouble right now, and if he didn't leave, there won't be any chance for him in the future. He didn't dare to face those massive mountain giants, no… he didn't even think about it because he wasn't even the size of their waistline, and they could easily crush them like an ant.Now all he could pray was those giants won't know about the hideout yet and only stumbled upon this area and just passed by. So, he could quickly get some more black liquid and other important stuff and leave this place.However, a furtive voice that sounded from their feet made Jacob's heart palpitate. "Milords, this is the place, and the hidden door is only a few meters away. Follow me!"'Fuck!'Jacob cursed, and he knew he has been discovered by someone else, and even though he can't see the person because of all those long bushes, he knew that might be the culprit who led those giants here!

Chapter 42 Storming The Hideout
﻿'Just how in the world that fucker (Decker) made this kind of grave mistake? But it didn't seem they come prepared or sure about the hideout. Because if they knew Decker was hiding there, then there won't be just two giants coming here after what he did.'Then this means this is just a scouting party led by someone who might be the one who found Decker's traces without him knowing, and from that tone, it's clear he didn't know who the owner of that hideout was or my identity. They also seemed to discover it recently, or they could've come sooner.'Furthermore, they're moving with caution in the rain, hiding their footsteps despite their powerful physiques. I didn't know if I'm lucky or unlucky, although I'm not present in the hideout and I have all the important things in my pendant, but those liquids and equipment will be lost. Shit!'Jacob cursed in silence and bemoaned at this bad but good luck because he had avoided a calamity. But he didn't feel happy about it because he wasn't prepared for this at all and this will also be the end of his haven.He no longer can extract heart essence and remain hidden while increasing his strength before embarking on his journey to find the exit of this mountain range.All his plans suddenly went to the gutter just because of an unknown mistake.In the end, Jacob clenched his teeth and slowly creep away from those three dangerous fellows, he knew he can't go back, and he had to flee as far as he can while he still has the chance and the other party didn't know he wasn't inside the hideout.Pig Head naturally followed him, with the carcass of the arrow tail jaguar on his shoulder.Jacob left in the opposite direction from where those three came from and in this heavy rainfall, his tracks were easily washed away."Just great, first slave, and now a lost vagabond…" Jacob muttered while clicking his tongue in exasperation.After they were a mile away from the hideout, Jacob increased his speed and ran at full speed without stopping. He wanted to create a vast distance between himself and them and then found some area to spend the night before continuing his aimless journey.---At Decker's hideout,The cloaked Bronze Goblin followed by Aaron, and Montel finally reached the place where the door was hidden."There's no trap outside, which means the maker didn't want to startle anyone and wanted to give the disguise that this is an ordinary moss floor, and it would've worked if I didn't see the smoke myself." The bronze goblin said with a hint of satire in his voice.Before he didn't dare to come close to this place, but now that he had two mountain giants beside him, he became shamelessly fearless!"Chad, stop your nonsense and made that person living here come out!" Aaron vexedly said. If not because of their precaution, they would've stormed the place already.Chad didn't dare to delay and bashed on the moss floor, which was also the door to the underground facility, and he bellowed, "Anyone is there? I see this door in this stormy rain and I humbly request to take shelter inside. I didn't have any malicious intent, and I'll pay one gold coin for a night's stay?"Their aim was clear, as long as there wasn't any powerful hermit living here, they would storm the entire place. The week didn't have the right to put resistance in this world!However, after Chad's torrent of heavy strikes, the door remains calm, with no noise except rain."Fuck off now, it's clear; the one inside is an ant or even that thievish goblin, and who knows he might escape from the underground passage while we're wasting our time being careful. Let me see who dared to offend us mountain giants!" Montel lose his patience because he was eager to get this hand-on Decker the most, and he didn't want to let him escape if really inside.Aaron also didn't stop Montel this time, and he knew if Deck was really inside with his astute personality, he might really slip away from their hands… again.Chad quickly move aside and the moment he saw furious Montel move.Montel swung his gigantic fist right at the door with full force.'Bang…'The ground trembled slightly as water splashed everywhere and at the place where that hammer-like fist landed, a dark hole appeared. The metallic door was lying on the bottom with a giant fist imprinted on it."Hmph, tiny hole, let me make it big!" Montel sneered before he sent a volley of powerful punches and widen the hole enough for him and Aaron to fit."Let's go." Montel took the stone staircase without waiting for Aaron or Chad.However, just as he took the third step before they suddenly hear a crackling sound under Montel's feet, and the very next moment thereafter, Montel suddenly grunted."Bastard, a lighting trap, I'll skin that guy alive!" Montel cursed and continue to move while he received a lighting blot on some steps, but they only seemed to slightly tingle him, nothing else.Gulping sounds could be heard from Chad. He knew those lighting traps were packed with almost a million volts, but that guy was taking them with a pinch of salt. He couldn't help but wonder just how strong these giants' skins were! Aaron smirked at this moment while following inside. "This boorish idiot."Before long, Montel has triggered almost all the traps in the underground base. Spikes, poison arrows, poison fog… but Montel didn't even receive a scratch from them as he reached the end of the passage where the hidden room was located!However, the place was too short for him and Aaron to enter and if they try to funnel their way in, the entire underground cave might crumble.Aaron sternly ordered at this moment, "Chad, get your ass down there and go inside and see if there's anyone there or not. All the traps have been dealt with. Us the X-Scanner. If there's an escape tunnel, let us know, post hastily!"

Chapter 43 Rainy Night
﻿Somewhere on a rainy mountain, after resting and running for a full day, Jacob was fully exhausted and, with the heavy rain, he was even more worried about catching some unknown disease.He was literally wearing two pieces of clothes right now, and even they weren't fully covering his skin.The only relief was that carcass of arrow tail jaguar which can provide him with a good nutritious meal, and he was also thinking of turning the thick hide into a warm coat.But first, he had to find a place to hide from this rain and the surrounding has already turned dark.'Now I understand why sometimes a small roof is far better than a vast sky…' Jacob thought bitterly as he continued to move slowly while looking for shelter.However, he knew it was a pipe dream to continue searching for something in this darkness where he can't even see Pig Head clearly.So, he built one himself with tree leaves and branches, which took him two hours to compete with Pig Head's help. Although it was extremely crude, the water was still flowing through the leafy roof, but it was far better than walking into darkness aimlessly."Although I'm not feeling any cold because of my special body condition, I still have to remain caution…" Jacob mumbled as he took out a knife and skinned the large jaguar.He meticulously separated the jaguar hide, which was more like fleece, and let it wash into the rain.Then there was only meat and the animal's viscera which he threw away and only meat left."Shit, I can't even light the fire…" Jacob lamented about how there wasn't anything dry to burn when suddenly his eyes opened wide, and he mumbled."Fire… those guys found the hideout right after my injection, and the rain also didn't fall for the day I did the extraction process. Then didn't this mean they were drawn here by the smoke rising from the door?"Although I took the precaution of doing the process at the night, it seemed I still underestimate those high-level species. Now I understand how they found the hideout. It was my own damn fault!"Jacob quickly believed his hypotheses, and he was ninety percent sure this was the real reason he got exposed.In the end, he could only sigh helplessly because he can't cry over spilled milk anymore and ate the meat raw since it would go bad if he left it in the rain anymore.He stored as much as could in the infinity pendant and eat the rest, leaving nothing. Even he was shocked at his appetite and strange instinct to devour anything once he started to eat without caring about taste.Jacob knew he wasn't like this, but after the first hunger pang and drinking the bone marrow, he stopped caring about taste or what he was eating anymore.As long as it can provide him with the nutrition, he can devour anything and this urge has become even more definite after the first injection, and he only noticed it now.'This meat isn't as nutritious as the goblin, but it still sends steam of warmth in my body, and now I didn't feel the urge to sleep anymore. I can feel the warm flow of energy flowing through my whole body. Is this how the heart converts my body?' Ace wondered with elation as he closed his eyes and felt that strange warm spreading in his body. He could feel his fatigue was going away, and he was recovering at an extremely fast pace.He remained in that half-conscious and half-asleep state for three hours before that warmth completely faded away, and he was now full of energy.His eyes opened and glowed as he said, "Cursed Immortality!"The white floating book appeared in front of him and with a thought, the cover flipped and the first page appeared.______[Cursed Immortality: Cursed Immortal Physique (Nine Phases)][Current Phase: First Phase]----First Phase: Body Transformation-Stages of Body Transformation: Three-First Stage: Cursed Heart Emergence (Current Stage)-Second Stage: Compete First Stage-Third Stage: Compete Second Stage----Inheritor: Jacob Steve-Current Phase: First (Body Transformation)-First Stage Progress: 13%______'Oh, extra three percent progress from ten in one go?' Jacob was astonished and flipped to the second page.______[First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Heart Emergence (First Stage)]-Cursed Heart Emergence: Three Levels---First Level: Formation of Immortal Mark Inside the Modify Heart (Complete)---Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 5%[Description: Please insert different Tier-1 or higher species' heart essence directly into your heart until the cursed mark is completely forged.][Note: A species' heart essence can only be inserted once, not again.]---Third Level: Complete Second Level---Completion of this stage affected in 100 Years of Youthful Lifespan______Jacob's lips curled upward when he saw the first injection give him four percent in one, and he wondered how much he'll get with the arrow tail jaguar's heart essence.But his expression fell when he thought he can't extract the heart essence anymore because everything was in the hideout.Jacob asked with a hint of perplexion, "Immortika, tell me how much my body changed?"As much as he didn't want to talk with this annoying book right now, he knew only Immortika know his condition the best. That was why he reluctantly asked the question.However, just like always, Immortika wrote erratically, "Hehehehe… I, much, say I quite like the scenery… hehehehe!"Dark lines formed on Jacob's forehead and snapped, "Can't you just answer the question without your shitty sarcasm?"Immortika wrote, "Hehehehehe… it isn't sarcasm, I'm enjoying the show. I wonder if those two big logs will find you or not. Ahhh… so much excitement!"As for your question, don't worry. After consuming that big cat, your body is at 59% compatible with your current heart strength. You just required to continue to kill and consume high-level meat, and you'll be just fine!"

Chapter 44 A Familiar Sound
﻿Jacob was pleased with Immortika's answer. He suddenly thought of something and asked with uncertainty, "Can you tell me more about those two giants and the third person with them? Consider it me asking about what tier they belong to."The writing change,"Hehe, if you asked me directly, I won't be able to answer, but since you put the question in the right way, I can naturally tell you about them."The big logs were from the Giant race branch called Mountain Giant Race, and they're supposed to be the 9th tier, but just as that goblin, their bloodline has declined, and they're currently at 7th tier."They had physical bodies as strong as rocks. As for how strong, only a 5 mm bullet can penetrate their skin, you can get the idea from this."As for the third one, hehehe, you're going to like this one, I'm sure of it, that was another goblin. And pretty sure he was the one who found that shithole, Hahahaha…"Jacob's face clouded the moment he read the word 'goblin' and gritted his teeth in frustration. He didn't know if he had some kind of ominous affinity with goblins or grudge, but these bastards keep making his life difficult. He even felt like destroying the entire race when he had power.Immortika continued playfully."That goblin was a Bronze Goblin, and a tier-4 one at that. If he was at tier-6, I'm afraid he would've heard your footsteps in that rain and your escape will be impossible."A bronze goblin had a very high hearing and their vision is very close to an infrared vision of a snake but not as good as one. However, they had a very keen sense, and they are very good at scouting and finding people. Now you understand how you were found? Hahaha…""Fuck, it was really that smoke!" Jacob cussed with a perplexed expression. Although his guess was right. But was still infuriated about how another goblin fucked him up, and this one seemed to be even more dangerous than Decker."Wait a moment, did you know I was already being watched but still didn't warn me?!" Jacob finally notice this point and coldly questioned."I told you I can't save you even if you're about to die, and you're on your own. Furthermore, I'm not an alarm clock nor can babysit you all the time, so deal with your problems. Besides, don't forget, I can only answer your questions related to scripture!"Jacob naturally didn't believe the last words and rebutted coldly, "You just enjoy watching me suffer, don't you? And stop that bullshit about not speaking without my questions. We both know it's a white fucking lie!""Hehehe, so what?"A vein popped up on Jacob's forehead, and he couldn't help but berated, "Fucking bastard, if I died, I'll make sure to take you down with me." And close the annoying book.He sighed helplessly afterward. "Even though this book is hateful and unreliable, I still need it to achieve immortality, and it's a fact that I'll just die without it. But every time it speaks I want to burn it, how infuriated. Well, at least now I know who's after me."Jacob peeked outside, and the rain has slowed down substantially. He mused it won't be long before it stopped, but the sky was still dark, so he waited until dawn before continuing his journey.Now, he knew his enemy can see heat signatures, so he had to be careful and hide his tracks, or he won't know when those two giants will ambush him.---Just like that, a week pass since Jacob had fled from his hideout and he didn't know where he was or where he was heading.But he was careful in his way and he was 90% sure he didn't leave any traces and now if those giants or goblins find him they can't connect him with Decker's hideout, and he could simply play a helpless human lost in this vast mountain range.However, he still preferred not to confront them because they can easily kill him on a whim, and he won't be able to escape those giants pursued either. He wasn't worried about the goblin at all if he was alone.One thing worth mentioning was that he encountered some animals and even hunt two uncommon animals on his fifth and seventh days.But because he only had one last container to collect their heart and blood, he felt extremely regretful. Now, he was only focusing on building his body, and with every hunt and meal, he grew stronger, and he still wasn't done.Jacob also notice as he moved in this particular direction that the animals were becoming weaker and weaker, that he even encountered common specie. He mused he might be close to the exit.As for Pig Head, he had greatly wilted from his burly self and Jacob was completely helpless because he didn't know how to nurture him without those liquids he simply didn't eat or drink normally even after he tried to feed him meat, even blood.But it just continued to wither with each passing day, and Jacob was afraid that Pig Head might perish before he could find an exit. Although he still had one last bottle of black liquid, he was saving it for himself, all this time in an emergency.Pig Head was completely disposable while his life wasn't and if he felt into some trouble, he could run alone and faster now.Time continued to pass and Jacob has been wandering in these mountain ranges for over three months now.On this particular day,"Boom…"Jacob, who was sitting on a large tree branch, suddenly heard an extremely familiar sound that he would not forget, even if he had forgotten everything. He had heard this sound countless times and for the better half of his life.His amber eyes flickered in serendipity and there was also a hint of elation as he mumbled, "A gunshot!"

Chapter 45 Humans!
﻿Jacob looked entirely different from three months ago. His body was brawny as he wore a crude coat made from arrow tail jaguar's hide and a pant made with another uncommon animal's hide.His face was covered with a thick layer of mud and a long, messy beard, while his hair was crudely cut to his shoulder length. His eyes were filled with sharp, murderous intent. He gave the feeling of a vile barbarian who has gone through many cruel battles.It was in fact the case as well because after his first month of wandering; he stopped using Pig Head to fight those animals and started to brawl with them himself. One reason for doing this was Pig Head was wilting with each fight, and the other reason was to get accustomed to his rising strength.After hunting and consuming nine uncommon and 25 common animals, his body has already become 100% compatible with his current heart. He didn't dare to believe he had such a strength, which was nothing but superhuman, and it was only the beginning.On the other hand, Pig Head was now half of his former burly self. He even appeared slightly weaker than Jacob now, and if Jacob let him continue to fight, he might've already been withered completely.However, this matter was the least important at this moment because of that gunshot Jacob heard a few moments ago. Before he wasn't sure if this world has guns or not before, but after hearing this sound he was now sure of it.Furthermore, he was searching for the exit all this time and this gunshot also mean there was someone who came here for either to hunt or they were also escapees like him. The chances of the latter scenario were minimum, but they were still there.'Since they're using a gun, this means they're weak and from the muzzle blast; it's probably shot from a rifle with a 66 cm in, barrel, and 15-round magazine, or a carbine with a 51 cm in the barrel and 12-round magazine, give or takes… Hoho, I never thought their technology is only at a Colt Lightning Carbine level or this person simply can't afford another one. Well, I'll find out soon…'Jacob's heart raced just thinking about guns, which were his bread and butter in his past life, and he dominated the entire world's advanced weaponry industry with them.Although he worked with modern firearms, their foundation was built on their predecessors, and he even had the biggest collection of antique guns.All in all, he knows these weapons by heart, and just by the sound he could tell which kind of gun was bullet has been shot, just like now. This was the true face of Jacob Steve, who devoted his life to sharpening the art of murdering!With quiet steps, he quickly reached the area where the gunshot sound came, and he heard some voices, which make his heart fill with excitement."Great shot, sir, Gus. That wild tusk boar died instantly!" A female voice exclaimed in praise.Another male voice rang with a hint of pride. "Lady Kiana, it was nothing. I once hunted a Three-Horn Lizard."Jacob slowly crept toward the trees, when he finally saw the owners of these voices. He was astonished when he saw four horse-riders wearing English hunter outfits.Two were young girls with beautiful features, while two were young men, tall and handsome.One of the young men with blond hair was holding a black rifle which look exactly like Colt Lightning Carbine in his hand, just as Jacob guess, and the other three were also armed with the same rifles.'Humans! It seemed I wandered into the uncommon region. According to Decker's journal, humans lived in uncommon regions, and this place is the weakest of the four known regions. Well, this is also good since it would be difficult if I accidentally enter the rare region.'I first have to get the knowledge of this world and then move toward the upper regions, and mingling with my kind is the easiest way. But those four looked like scions of some rich family.'If I appeared before them, they might turn hostile from the way I look right now. Then I can just follow them back, and I'll eventually reach human territory.'Jacob quickly decided to remain hidden and follow these four around until they led him to some human city. Well, he was also interested in their conversation and those Colt Lightning Rifle."Sir Arian, where should we go next?" Gus looked at the black-haired young man on a brown horse.Arian thought for a moment before he said, "We're currently on the peripheries of the Rainy Mountain Ranges and if you want to hunt uncommon animals we have to ride for five days or even longer if we're unlucky."But we can't be out for this long, right? So, let's go toward the dark wolf-ridge which is the closet, and hunt the Dark Wolves. Only common animals and some can evolve into uncommon, they're vicious and hunt in a pack. They can even hunt uncommon animals in numbers. We can easily retreat if we encounter any danger. What do you think?"The two girls looked at Gus with anticipation. He was clearly the leader of this small party.Gus nodded without even thinking and pridefully said, "Then dark wolf ridge it is them. I just happen to need some wolf fur, heh."The two girls giggles hearing Gus joke with admiration in their eyes while Arian smile wryly at his employer.With Arian guidance, they galloped the horses and ride toward the direction of dark wolf ridge.Jacob, who watched and listening all this, couldn't help but click his tongue, 'So, that place was called dark wolf ridge and those dogs were sneaky. They even manage to almost faze my coat. I'm afraid those four scions will be dead before they could lead me to human settlement. What to do now…'

Chapter 46 Dark Wolf Ridge
﻿The four horse riders carefully move toward the dark wolf ridge, which was a few miles away from the point they stop before.But they were completely oblivious to the fact that someone was following them despite their horses, and this person was on foot!Furthermore, this person was doing this with extreme agility and without breaking any sweat at that.After half an hour of journey, they finally reached the footstep of a mountain valley.The blond hair youth name Gus questioned the black hair Arian, "Is this the entrance of the dark wolf ridge?"The two beautiful girls were also admiring the beautiful view, completely oblivious to how dangerous this place was.Arian nodded and replied solemnly, "Yes, sir Gus, if another wanted to enter the deeper parts of the rainy mountains, one way is to cross this dark wolf ridge. We should only hunt within ten kilometers, or we might attract large wolf packs, and we have to leave before dark. Those dark wolves are extremely active in the dark, and we'll be in trouble if they ambush us."Gus said, "Then why are we waiting for? We only have three hours before it got dark. What do you think, ladies?"Kiana, the young petite and vivacious lady with a round face and smooth white skin, replied with a hint of excitement, "Yes, we'll need to hurry. I don't want to miss the chance to experience hunting, right, Jennifer?"Jennifer, who had a captivating oval face with pale white skin and bright long blonde hair, wanted to say something but, in the end, was hesitant while looking at her best friend's expected expression and her brother, Gus, confident smile. She took a deep breath and nodded with a smile that was somewhat forceful, "Alright, but we have to leave before it gets dark.""Hehe, just trust your big brother in this." Gus confidently declared and signal Arian to lead the way.They all slowly move while holding their rifles in the active position, so they could react at any given moment of danger.But to their misfortune, they didn't encounter any wolf or any kind of animal, even after entering five miles deep in the dark wolf ridge.Arian couldn't help but knit his eyebrows. "We didn't encounter a single wolf all this time. What's going on?"Gus coolly said, "Don't worry, maybe we need to go deeper before those dogs show themselves. With these latest 'cannons', we didn't need to worry about some lowly dogs at all."Arian didn't retort, nor did he reply. He was feeling uneasy because he wasn't like these three aristocrats who hunt once in a while for fun, but he was a professional hunter who make living with hunting.The rainy mountain ranges were extremely vast and dangerous, so he seldom came here, especially after becoming someone's guide. If Gus hasn't offered him this latest 'cannon' he wasn't willing to enter the rainy mountain range with these three house flowers.Nevertheless, he knew he can't leave them here because of their backgrounds unless he wanted to live his life in these mountains, which was akin to not living at all.That was why he had to do his duty of guide and kept them safe while letting them hunt some animals in the outer parts of the rainy mountains and this dark wolf ridge was quite safe as long as they didn't enter too deep within and these three will also get their kick out of hunting the wolves.But now that no wolf was pouncing on them even after entering this deep in the dark wolf ridge, he started to feel uneasy.Just like that, had entered over ten miles deep into the dark wolf ridge and if they continue to move, they'll enter the breeding place of the dark wolves, which will spell their death at any day.Arian signal them to stop before he said, with a grim look in his eyes, "Sir Gus, we should leave. There's something wrong with this place."Gus looked at Arian with an unkind gaze and sternly said, "Sir Arian, I don't see any wolf in here, but you keep being overly dramatic. I think I'll have to talk with your Agency Leader after I got back."Arian frowned, but he didn't back down, "You can complain all you want, but I don't think the Leader will punish me, because I think there's a rare Wolf King in the dark wolf ridge now. That's why all the wondering wolves have retreated to the core of this ridge, and only a wolf king can make this happen."Trust me, you'll thank me later, but we have to leave before the thousands of wolves will be upon us. Or we don't even have a chance!"Gus was startled, hearing 'Wolf King'. It was a rare species that can control its kind as long as there wasn't another wolf king in the pack.Furthermore, the birth of the wolf king was a very grave matter for the people who lived close to this area of rainy mountain ranges.A wolf king can easily cause a wolf stampede, which will not be good news for humans at all.Jennifer also spoke with an imploring tone, "Brother, listen to him. We'll go to some other place."Kiana also seemed terrified and looked at Gus.Gus clenched his teeth and finally agreed, "Fine, let's go then!"Arian have massive sighed with relief, and he quickly turned around his horse and led them toward the exit of this ridge.However, the dusk was already starting and when there were only three miles between the exit and them; they heard a ghastly cry from afar which made them shiver,"Awooooooo!"Arian couldn't help but shout, "That's definitely a wolf king's cry. We have to leave quickly. It was a clear signal for the hunt, we've been discovered!"In shades of trees, Jacob, who has been following and listening to this group all day long, couldn't help but wonder with gleaming eyes, 'A rare species? I have never encountered it during my entire travel. If I can collect its blood and heart…'At this moment, Jacob looked at the galloping group of horses with extremely cold eyes like they were high-quality baits!

Chapter 47 Fishing
﻿Jacob followed the galloping group with steady yet silent footsteps while calmly observing the situation at the back.'That little girl (Kiana) is wearing an aromatic scent. Even I can smell it from here, not to talk about those annoying dogs. They're going to get killed no matter how much they run because of their own stupidity.'Since that's the case, they better be baits for me and let me see if I can sneak attack the wolf king. As long as I killed that beast, the leadership will crumble, and I can easily get the heart and blood.'The animals above uncommon rank was known as beasts, and they were far more powerful than any uncommon animals. Those rare species with high intelligence and low physical strength can't hold a candle to those beasts if they don't have the means to deal with them.Jacob hasn't encountered any beast from all the way here, and it was only natural because he was heading in the direction of the uncommon region. Luckily, or else he might've been chased around by the beasts in the rare region if he had taken the opposite route.Nevertheless, he didn't want to miss the chance to acquire a rare species' heart and blood. As for going to a human settlement, he had already spotted a map in Arian's possessions, so he cared less about those strangers' lives anymore, since they were more important as his baits than guides.Besides, just as he said, even if he wasn't here, those four reckless fools were destined to die, but now they'll die because of a cause.Just as Jacob's prediction, thereupon, multiple footsteps sounded within the valley and those four also notice this and started to panic.Gus couldn't help but shouted in horror, "What is happening? How can they track us so quickly?!"Arian has also had a pale expression, clearly appalled by this same question. He suddenly thought of something and proclaimed, "It's the smell! Dark Wolves have a terrifying sense of smell. We should've prepared for this… damn it, it's too late now!" They were riding as fast as they could, but the trees were making it difficult for horses to gain distance, and those wolves were catching up.Kiana's expression was ashen as she shouted in frenzy, "Do something, I don't want to die!"Arian retorted grimly, "There's nothing you can do now. Those wolves behind us are just the vanguard. As long as they surround us, more will come. We can only run for our lives!"Gus felt great despair at this moment when he saw dark wolves, the size of an adult lion, chasing while viciously looking at them with their beastly eyes. He suddenly thought of something.His eyes landed on Arian, who was also looking back, and a ruthless glint flashed past his eyes. He pointed his rifle at Arian's horse's head and pull the trigger.'Boom…'Arian didn't even know what happened and after this explosive sound, his horse suddenly somersault, and he was sent flying into a tree. He slammed right face first and his face banged open like a watermelon as blood gushed out.Jennifer couldn't believe what Gus had just done and looked at him with frightened eyes as she looked back and saw those wolves pouncing on the dismembered horse and still hanging by a threat, Arian.Gus exclaimed coldly before Kiana or Jennifer could utter a single word, "If I haven't done this, we all would be torn into pieces by those animals right now. It was either us or him, so just focus on running!"They couldn't retort to his statement because now those wolves weren't chasing them like before, and they could only keep their head low.Jacob, who was moving in the shades of trees, naturally observed everything and pull an amusing yet cold smile. 'Hehe, backstab when needed, just like me in the old days. Let's see who will be sacrificed next. I want to see if he could kill his kin for survival. I'll collect that rifle and other stuff later since those dogs won't eat them… probably.'Although he wanted that map, he didn't want to put a target on his head right now, so he gave up and decided to look for it after this was all over… if there was something left of it.'Awooooo'The same powerful howl rang again, and those wolves trembled slightly before they stopped eating the corpses and again chased the reaming three.Jacob's eyes shimmered when he saw those wolves leaving and looked at the bag laying in a bloody pool of dead horse and the rifle not far away from Arian's mutilated corpse.'If I want to sneak attack the wolf king, my already jagged knife won't be enough anymore…' Jacob looked left and right before quickly leaping toward the leather bag and rifle at full speed.He successfully grabbed the bag before he picked up the rifle and retreated hastily before any wolf could notice him!His speed was 90 Km/h after his body fully became compatible with his heart, and not only that, he can achieve this speed within a second.That was what made this snatching occasion so easy just now, or he might've got noticed by those vicious animals by now.Jacob threw the back into the infinity pendant without checking the interior and examined the Colt Lightning Rifle with searing eyes. He couldn't help but creased its smooth magazine gate.'Although this is the crude imitation of Colt Lighting, it still has its power, but its muzzle is of inferior quality and the trigger pin seemed to be of silver. I wonder which idiot made it. This will blow up in 50 or 55 shots and from the look of it's still new and fully loaded, so I should be able to use it for some time…'Jacob saw thought the rifle's flaws at a glance, but he was satisfied as long as it can shoot some bullets in succession since he didn't have the time to modify it right now!

Chapter 48 Killing Dark Wolf King
﻿Jacob continued to follow the galloping horses and the dark wolves.He was waiting for the wolf king to show itself and then a chance to ambush it. He didn't care about those three lives anymore since they bought it upon themselves.Furthermore, he already got what he wanted, and he didn't want someone like Gus traveling with him at all, even though he was the same."Scatter quickly or we won't survive!"Gus's expressions were ashen when he saw those wolves didn't give up on them, and the wolf king was controlling the wolf pack to hunt them. He knew killing another won't work this time, so he chose another option which was to escape alone by using the other two, even his sister!Kiana madly shouted hysterically at this moment, "No, I don't want to die, and I don't know the way, I'll die if I go alone!"Jennifer, on the other hand, didn't lose control of her emotions and quickly agreed with Gus's suggestion with a subtle look in her eyes, "Fine, let Kiana go with you, I'll go on the other side, this way wolves will be divided!"Gus didn't have time to think about anything else and shouted, "Go!"Jennifer didn't delay, either, and she meticulously controlled the horse's reins and turned in the other direction.The pack of dark wolves also separated into two groups and chase after both of them.Jacob's eyes shone with a cold light, watching this sudden turn of events. 'That woman seemed to guess why they're being tracked so easily… hah!'Jacob completely ignored Jennifer and continue to follow Gus and Kiana because most wolves were after them.Gus also noticed the wolves seemed to double than before, and his expression turned extremely grim. He looked at crying Kiana with killing intent.However, before he could use her like Arian, he heard powerful footsteps in front, and thereafter; he saw a four-meter silhouette lunging toward him from the front with a huge maw filled with sharp teeth.Before he could react, the maw completely engulfed his face, and it closed instantly, and he didn't get the chance to utter a single word before his head was severed from his torso.The enormous silhouette also tackled the horse and sent it flying with Gus's headless body, and Kiana lose her consciousness seeing this horrible scene and fell between the bloodthirsty wolf pack.The enormous silhouette was a four-meter dark wolf, but it also has silver fur on its neck. It was the newly evolved dark wolf king. The Dark Wolf King spat Gus's marred head and looked up in the sky and let loose a powerfully imposing roar,'Awooooo!'The other dark wolves trembled before they lower their heads in fear like dogs.However, Dark Wolf King seemed to sense something as it stopped roaring and turned its head toward a tree, and it instantly noticed a humanoid silhouette!'Boom, boom, boom…'But before it could react, three consecutive gunshots rang in the vicinity, catching the wolf king off guard, nor did it have any time to dodge the insanely fast bullets!They directly landed on its skull, and one of them was between its eyes!The wolf king didn't have the chance to react before it was shot down by Jacob!Those other wolves didn't know what happened, but when the wolf king's massive body fell to the ground, they all roar in panic and ran in all directions in perturbation.'Well, this goes quite well. I should quickly collect its heart and blood before those dogs came back to their senses.' Jacob quickly jumped off the tree.A metallic container appeared in his hand and he quickly emptied it, there were blood and the heart of another uncommon animal.Since he had already hunted a rare beast, he naturally didn't need an uncommon animal's heart and blood.He quickly sprang into action and acquired the wolf king's big heart, which was 1 foot in size, and filled the container with its blood before storing it away.'It just a pity I can't eat it…' Jacob felt great regret for leaving this rare quality meat for those wolves, but he knew he can't carry this large carcass, or he'll be hunted down by those wolves as well soon.His eyes suddenly landed on Kiana. She was still alive and only bleeding from the wound on her head, and then looked at those bags and rifles carried by Gus and her.He nonchalantly picked up everything, the leather bags and rifles were now hanging around his neck, he said to the unconscious Kiana, "You should never wear perfume while hunting. I hope you can survive to remember this."With that, he left toward the dark wolf ridge exit.He was going toward where he left Pig Head to wait for him since that guy has become his burden, but he still was unwilling to let him go because he could tell as long as he found those liquids, Pig Head could be revived back to its peak.Because Pig Head was still stronger than Jacob in its prime, and this was the reason Jacob didn't want to dispose of him this soon.But Jacob also knew it was a long shot if he wanted to find those liquids, after observing Gus's group and the crude rifles in their possession. He was doubtful that humans could produce such liquids.In the end, he was awakened in the presence of a rare species and that guy was nothing but ordinary, so he had little hope after coming to the uncommon region.Nevertheless, this place was still perfect for him to hide until he completed the second stage of Cursed Heart Emergence and absorbed the information from human society. It won't be too late to move toward the rare region at that time.After finding Pig Head, Jacob found a place to rest and also to see what was in those three bags that he got from this small encounter!

Chapter 49 Rain Town
﻿Jacob opened the first bag, which was the cleanest of the three leather bags he got, and it was from Kiana who wasn't dead and 'intact' when he took it.However, when he saw the content, he frowned; there were two sets of women's clothes, makeup, and even a bottle of scent. Other than that, he found fifteen colt bullets and a small pouch with ten silver coins and 48 bronze coins. These coins were the same as he got from Decker."She deserved what happened to her," Jacob mumbled, annoyingly. He stored away the bullets and coins and throw everything else aside.Then he opened Gus's bag which holds, a pair of new hunter cloths, a machete knife, 35 colt bullets, and a money pouch that holds, 64 silver coins and 12 bronze coins. There was a silver insignia.Lastly, he opened Arian's bag, and this guy was caring two machete knives, a leather map, 42 colt bullets, another money bag with 23 silver and 75 bronze, and the last thing which make Jacob delighted, a revolver with 12 extra bullets for it!Jacob quickly examines the revolver. "It's another crude imitation of Enfield Revolver, but its length is 13 cm in and cartridge .576 which also increased its caliber to .576 as well, and effective firing range has increased up to 35 yds."All these firearms were used between the 19th and 20th centuries in my world, and they're not at their peak yet. Could it be this world technology is only at this level? But how is this possible, well, I have to see for myself!" Jacob stored away the revolver and other small things, except for the map.The map wasn't as detailed as he was hoping for, but it was marked by Arion neatly, which Jacob appreciate.'If I keep moving north, I'll reach Gloria Country border, and these people were also from there and this map only denoted a small part of the rainy mountain range and Gloria Country. Well, it's enough for me...' Jacob smiled in satisfaction before he stored the map away as well.Now his eyes landed on the three rifles as they shone with ingenuity, 'I hope I didn't lose my touch…'With that, Jacob started to dismantle the three rifles and modified them with his peak skills.---The Gloria Country was a small part of the human kingdom, and it was under the jurisdiction of a baron.There were four big cities in Gloria's country and many small towns.The closest town to the Rainy Mountain Ranges was a mid-size town named 'Rain Town' and many hunters who make their living with hunting or others who enjoy hunting as a hobby first come here for supplies.That was why this town was always lively and filled with armed people all year long.However, this was also the reason for this town's high crime rate, and no one wanted to offend anyone without no good reason.Because here just a normal-looking person can be from a noble household and in Gloria Country, if you offend a noble you won't meet a good ending.Nevertheless, all this has nothing to do with this newly arrived handsome man, with long silver hair, he was wearing a hunter outfit while a revolver hung on his belt.He was none other than Jacob, who has cleaned himself up and wore the hunter outfit he found in Gus's bag. After scrutinizing the small town for an hour, he noticed many were wearing the same outfits and caring firearms openly, without any restrictions.So, he does the same, but he only showed his revolver because he didn't see anyone caring a rifle, and he mused those guys were from some rich family, and it would be troublesome if someone suspected anything.Now he looked just like the others, besides his unusual hair color, but no one seemed to be interested in him as he passed the unguarded town gates.'They're quite lax.' Jacob smiled as he curiously observed the town, which looked like the town from the middle 18s, and his guess about humans being so inferior in technology became even more substantial.But this also means he can't get what he wanted here, not the liquid or any equipment in Decker's lab. He suddenly felt that shithole might be the biggest boon he received from Decker, but it was gone in smoke because of his own mistake.However, he didn't have the time to remanence about his past mistakes. He found a middle-aged man who wasn't wearing a hunter outfit and was normally dressed.He politely asked, "Sir, can you please tell me where I can find a bookstore or healing medicine?"Jacob didn't find any kind of medicine in Gus and others' bags, so he was quite curious about this, and he also wanted to find the liquids as soon as possible for Pig Head, who he hid in the forest far away from the town.The man was startled when he heard Jacob calling him and asking such a question, he became scared for some reason and replied with a trembling voice, "I… please forgive me, Sir, I-I'm just an ordinary mason, and we don't have such a luxury to afford any medicine. So, I c-can't help you."Jacob frowned slightly, and he could tell from this man's facial expression that he was extremely afraid of him and also telling the truth. His heartbeat also increased rapidly when he saw Jacob's frown."Thank you." Jacob let the man go. He was afraid this guy might start to cry if he held him longer, and he didn't want to cause a commotion.'Strange, he knew about the medicine, but he can't afford it? It seemed I still have to investigate more, and I should talk with a hunter since these natives seemed to be afraid of hunters. I won't get anything out of them.'Jacob moved on and this time his eye landed on an old building, which was a pub, and suddenly remembered drinks.With a hint of anticipation, he entered the pub in large strides!

Chapter 50 The Pub
﻿Jacob entered the pub and a strong, intoxicating alcoholic smell filled his nostrils. His lips curled. 'Finally, a familiar smell…'Jacob looked at the pub interior, and it was like the old pubs in the 1800s. There was a huge counter covering a corner with stools around it and round tables and chairs. He felt he has entered some kind of old movie set.Many burly men were drinking and chatting happily, while some of them were flirting with waitresses in revealing gowns.Some customers notice Jacob's eye-catching appearance, and he had this cold aura around him which made him look like a cold killer.Jacob didn't mind those stares, he was already used to them in his past life, and nonchalantly walked over to the counter and sat on an empty stool.He curiously looked at the pub's alcohol display and felt reminisced.The bartender, who was a tall, muscular man, with a short goatee and bronze skin, approached Jacob with a smile and asked, "You're new here, friend? What can I make for you?"Jacob, easily seen through those exploiting eyes and coolly said, "Yeah, just landed here today, give me something strong.""Just a sec…" The bartender smiled and made Jacob drink.Another man with a slightly chubby figure sitting on Jacob's left was sneakily glancing at him, especially his revolver.He said with a smile showing his green teeth, "You sure know your guns, brother. It's the D4 Revolver, extremely slick."Jacob looked at him and merely said while glancing at the silver revolver on the man's gun belt, "You're not bad yourself, that long barrel revolvers are far more powerful than mine.""Hehe, this old thing isn't as fast as yours. I'll be dead if an agile animal attacked me." He scoffed as he gulped his beer."Well, you seemed pretty alive to me," Jacob commented with a smirk."Here's your hell's tour, a specialty of hour rain town." The bartender put a square glass half filled with bubbly blue translucent liquid. Jacob didn't stand on ceremony and took a sip, and his eyes widen slightly, 'Now this is what I survive for!'He drank the whole thing in one gulp and smashed the glass on the counter and said, "Good, another one!"The bartender's eyes brighten, and he chuckled, "Right away!""Man, you can really drink, huh?" the man beside him clicked his tongue."Nothing to brag about. My name is Jack, tell me, are you a native of rain town?" Jacob asked as he picked up the newly refilled glass."Miller." Miller introduced, "No, I'm from Lionheart City and only here to hunt some petitioned animals. What about you?""Gloria City, and for the same reason. But I'm looking for some medicine for my journey. Do you know where I can look for them?" Jacob asked in a roundabout way this time.However, to this surprise, both bartender and Miller suddenly looked at him with disbelief as if they heard something ridiculous.Miller sneered, "You're not from Gloria City, are you?"'What's wrong with them?' Jacob thought.Jacob's expression didn't change at all and merely said, "Does it matter?""Hmph, another bumpkin who wanted to be mysterious." Miller snorted with a hint of disdain.Jacob's expression fell slightly as he put his hand in his pocket and took out a silver coin and put it on the counter and looked at the bartender. "Answer my questions and it's yours."The bartender was startled for a moment, but his eyes shone with greed as he looked at the silver coin. It was equivalent to his month's salary."What do you want to know?" He asked while his eyes fixed on the silver coin.Miller's expression was also somewhat ugly now when he saw Jacob completely ignore him and slap his face with that silver."Medicine, where can I find them?" Jacob sternly asked while his finger remain on the silver coin.The bartender truthfully said, "I don't know where you're from, but in Gloria Contrary, you can only buy medicine from apothecary guilds, and they're extremely expensive.""Where can I find these apothecary guilds?" Jacob questioned with a hint of realization."Only in the four major cities. Those apothecaries disdain small towns like us and didn't bother to open any branches, nor did they let any merchants sell them. Furthermore, it's a crime to sell medicine without the apothecary guild's permission, and only in the black market you can find them, and that's if you're extremely lucky." The bartender sighed helplessly.Miller disdainfully commented at this moment, "You have no idea about the status of the apothecary guild. Its roots are spread all over the four regions, and they didn't give even the Humane King face. That's why no one dared to cross them and eye the massive medicine business."'A monopoly on medicine? It's like controlling the life of the masses. These guys are playing in gold. I need more information…' Jacob felt extremely ignorant."Last question, where can I buy books?" Jacob didn't even glance at Miller and only looked at the bartender."There's an old book store two stresses away. You can buy common books there." The bartender replied.Jacob finished his drink and put away his finger from the silver coin. He stood up and was about to leave when the bartender's unhappy voice sounded, "You didn't pay for drinks!"Jacob didn't turn around, and only his stony voice sounded, "A silver is enough for the drinks, and you can keep the change. If you're not satisfied, follow me."With that, Jacob walked without even looking around.Miller felt Jacob was too imperious, and he moved his hand toward the revolver's handle.The bartender also didn't stop Miller, as his eyes were filled with ridicule at Jacob's blind confidence. It was the lawless Rain Town, how daring of him to show his back?!"Bang!"A gunshot sounded, drawing everyone's attention in the pub before a body fell on the group.Surprisingly, it was Miller with a bullet hole in his forehead and his brain scattered on the floor while his hand was still on the gun handle!Jacob finally turned around and looked at the gobsmacked bartender with the revolver in his hand. "You can collect the payment from my 'bumpkin' friend there and keep the change… again!"
