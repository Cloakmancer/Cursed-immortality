Chapter 111 A Devil!
﻿Chad was the most miserable because he was with the giants. He also got blacklisted for one year. Most importantly, he nearly died after taking a rageful punch from Montel.How he survived was a miracle, but afterward, he had to spend his entire saving to recover and survived in the wilderness for a year.It was also that time when this mysterious person approached him and offered him a job for protection because he was famous for his tracking skills.But he had to sign a loyalty contract which was as good as a slave contract, and as long as he remained in the uncommon dark city, he can't hide or broke the contract.In the end, Chad had no choice since he was in dire need of help, and most of the residents of the Dark City weren't willing to do business with him because of the Giants and his blacklisted status.From that day on, he was working for this mysterious person while he hated the giants and Decker's killer to the bone since they were the ones who were the main reason for his miserable life.However, not even in his dreams, he thought that the mysterious killer would appear again, and the killer even knew him!"Y… Y-YOU…. Killed Decker???" He was gobsmacked and appalled as he looked at the masked figure stained in blood.This was simply ironic that he finally met the culprit for his sufferings and he was completely helpless to resist!Although he dreamed of meeting the bastard who ruined everything, now that dream has come true, it turned out to be a nightmare instead!Jacob coldly replied, "I even ate him. It seemed you knew that bastard."A chill ran down Chad's spine when he heard this, and his throat got dry. He hoarsely spoke, "I-It was because of his tribe that I was exiled from my tribe and had to run in this barren place. B-but I… I didn't mean to ruin your peace. It was those giants!"He gritted his teeth in hatred. "They destroyed your place forcefully and then took everything. I even got wounded without getting anything in return except suffering and regret! If you spare m… coug…"Before he could finish his deceitful speech, Jacob's blade was already flashed past his neck, and the next moment with widely open eyes his head was rolling on the ground.Jacob scoffed at dismembered Chad. "I'll send those giants to accompany you soon!"He never even thought of spearing Chad for a moment because this guy put his life in danger two times already, and it was unforgivable!'Tap…tap…'Suddenly, raindrops started to fall, before it poured hard within a few moments.Jacob looked impassive as the blood washed away with rain. But actually, he was closely hearing his heartbeat at this moment.'Even after all this combat and running, my heartbeat is still stable, and only my hunger is rising. It seemed the fluid acceleration is going to be hard to master. But I also don't have to worry about accidentally activating it now as long as I didn't encounter real danger.'He merely smirked at the end because he knew after raising his body equal to his heart progress of 30%, he might not need to worry about the rare region at all.Nevertheless, he wasn't arrogant enough to believe this delusion. He picked up the headless body and head and hurried back toward the cave. He was going to have a goblin feast tonight!---'Aghh…'An anguish shrilled rang in the cavern before Mr. Observer opened his eyes, filled with pain, and with great difficulty, he lifted himself from the stone floor.However, he nearly fell down with a daunted expression when he saw a small humanoid body skewered on top of a large fire.But he was completely scared out of his wits when he saw a pile of bones beside a long silver hair person who still had a large crispy and charred leg piece in his hand and gobbling it down like a wolf.Although he looked pleasing to the eyes, in Mr. Observer's eyes, he looked like a devil at the moment!"So, you finally decided to wake up, huh?"When Jacob's cold amber eyes fell on Mr. Observer, he felt an icy chill in his spine and instantly crawled backward."YOU… t-those b-bone…""Heh, that's your boss. Although he was an ugly swine outside, he's 'much better' from the inside." Jacob's lips curled up into a devilish smile as he confirmed Mr. Observer's guess.Mr. Observer's eyes were wild opened in horror as his back was now facing the wall, but he didn't dare to speak anymore. He was afraid that the devil will eat him as well.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Although he heard of some vicious species that ate intelligent species without caring about anything but seeing them with his own eyes was another experience."What? Feeling noxious just because I'm eating someone you know, heh?" Jacob sneered as he took a chunk of a mouthful of meat before he said, "In my eyes, you all are nothing but high-quality livestock… like you would think of any livestock."Mr. Observer felt like fainting again, as he was terrified of Jacob now."Y-You… obscene devil!" An appalled shrill rang at this moment from the other side of the cavern.It was the capped person, but now his face was fully revealed. Although its voice sound famine, it was actually a green face wizened old monster with a face full of wrinkles, sharp teeth, and a pointy nose. But the most noticeable thing about this person was a small horn on its bald head."You're from the Orc race, right? A Pine Orc." Jacob questioned without caring about the dreadful expression of Pine Orc."Just who are you? What are you doing in the uncommon region?!" The Pin Orc was completely frightened of Jacob right now.He didn't understand why someone like Jacob would appear in the uncommon region-level Dark City. With his horrifying strength, he should have no problem staying in the rare dark city, even with a wanted title.If they knew Jacob was a hidden monster, they would never even consider approaching him, much less coming after his wealth.But they weren't to be blamed for this because Jerry failed to sense Jacob's danger with his unique danger sense. or nothing like this would've happened.He also didn't recognize Jacob's kind, despite wrecking his brain, but one thing was clear now, Jacob's strength was on top of the food chain. He also had some 'unique ability' to hide his true strength even from a hobgoblin danger sense."Livestock won't ask questions." Jacob chuckled coldly before he threw the last bone on the pile.After eating the entire hobgoblin's meat, he could feel his hunger was half subdued. and his body had returned to its masculine shape as well and he wasn't feeling any crazing hunger like before, but pure strength.If he fought with Jerry again, he can now manhandle him like a rage doll!"Now answer some of my questions. What is this?"From the side, Jacob suddenly picked up a small glass vial, half filled with crystalline black liquid.He found it on Pine Orc's neck hanging with a chain as if it was extremely precious to him, so this aroused his interest the most of all things he looted from the three.The Pine Orc's eyes contracted, and his expression contorted when he saw the small vial in Jacob's hand as if his heart had torn apart. But he didn't want to answer the question.However, his lips moved on their own at this moment. "It's Advance Uncommon Grade Titan Tears. It's an ancient elixir that can help any species below Epic Rank to break their limits with no hidden side effects. I was planning to take them after dealing with your matter."Jacob's eyes narrowed when he heard this unexpected answer. While Pine Orc's eyes went wide in horror as he touched his forehead, which now had a deep wound.He suddenly thought of the parasite gem they bring to enslave Jacob, he bellowed "Y-you enslaved me!"Jacob was quite satisfied with this parasite gem, which made them talk as long as he used them with the bracelet on his wrist. He now owns both Pine Orc and Mr. Observer!"So, this can help you break the limit, huh? Like a power upgrade?" Jacob looked at the small vial and Pine Orc's torn expression.He suddenly had a bold thought and opened the vial before taking a tiny drop!The moment the drop melted in his mouth, he suddenly felt a warm energy bomb explode on his tongue before it spread throughout his entire body!Within a few seconds, Jacob felt his hunger decrease by five percent, and his eyes went wide as he looked at the small vial and the little liquid in it with disbelief!Without caring about Pine Orc's appalled expression, he hurriedly asked with ecstasy, "This Titan Tears!? Explain how you come in contact with it and where is the recipe?!"

Chapter 112 Titan Tears
﻿"This Titan Tears!? Explain how you come in contact with it and where is the recipe?!"Jacob's reaction was only natural because this one small drop had made his hunger subdue by five percent, and it wasn't temporary either. He could feel the strength of his body increase.He clearly remembered Immortika told him that he required an exorbitant amount of aliment, but it never said it would have to be from the flesh.Although he knew he might find some other sources like special fruits, plants, or herbs in the rare region. But he never expected to find this so-called elixir, and it would be even more potent than a rarer species' meat.He only tested it because he was curious when he heard the Pine Orc's description and effect of these Titan Tears. Furthermore, he could tell these titan tears were probably the same elixir Jerry was talking about.So, he wanted to see why these guys had taken such a risk just to make these titan tears, and now he understands.The Pine Orc didn't want to tell his biggest secret to Jacob, but since he was enslaved, he had no choice in this matter.He told, "I belong to the Potion Alchemy Guild in the rare region and Jerry privately approached me 12 years ago. He had this map of a Ruin, and he required an Intermediate Potion Alchemist's assistance, so I agree."At that time, I didn't know Jerry had stolen that old map from the Hobgoblin Clan and a secret organization. I don't know their name, and Jerry always kept it to himself."But when we reached that ruin and found a metal box. In that box was an old box called 'Titan Tears'. It was a set of Elixir Formula from Uncommon Grade to Epic Grade."As I said before, it was an ancient elixir that could help any species break something called 'Bloodline Limiter', and breaking through the fable Epic Rank was also a possibility as long as we could concoct the Epic Grade Titan Tears."However, just the ingredients required for the low-rare-grade Titan Tears were almost impossible to gather, much less the Epic Grade. Nevertheless, just the uncommon grade titan tears were enough to raise our strength at the peak of rarer species."But before we could celebrate, we were ambushed by both the Hobgoblin Clan and that secret organization. They somehow tracked Jerry down and were waiting for him to find that box before taking it from him."However, Jerry was also prepared, and he used an extremely rare Black Poison Bomb and killed everyone. If he hadn't given me the antidote, I would've also been dead."But he required an Intermediate Potion Alchemist to make this elixir for him, and it also ties us together from then on. Albeit, it was worth being a fugitive with Jerry for this elixir."Yet, we still underestimated that secret organization. They somehow found out that we were buying the titan iron in secret, and tracked us down again. But because of the increase in Jerry's strength after taking the elixir, we had a close shaved that time, and directly escaped to the uncommon dark city and lie low for five years."Only after making sure there wasn't anyone chasing us did we surface again, but didn't dare to leave the dark city anymore…"Jacob stopped him at this moment. "Alright, I didn't want your entire adventure story. Where is this formula right now?"Gritting his teeth, the Pin Orc unwillingly spoke, "To not draw any unwanted attention, Jerry opened the pawn shop while I became a potion maker at the potion tower. We only contact each other when Titan Tears were involved, and the formula is in my workshop."Jacob's eyes shimmered sharply. 'This is simply a windfall for me. If I could make the Titan Tears in large batches, I could make progress without being worried about any consequences!'Maybe there are more such potions in the Potion Alchemy Guild. Decker also wrote there were many Alchemy Formulas. They were top secrets of his Apothecary Alchemy Guild, and even he didn't dare to write them in his journal!'Jacob never thought he would take such a keen interest in this alchemy all of a sudden. There were many branches of this Alchemy Guild, and it was hard to tell which one was the most prominent.However, it wasn't the time or place for him to learn.Jacob sharply looked at the listless Pine Orc and said, "We'll be leaving for the dark city the moment the rain stops. You'll fetch this Titan Tears formula for me, and since you're a potion alchemist, you would be quite rich. I want everything in your name into my account and any gold you have in stash. Also, pack your staff and move to Jerry's shop. You're going to work for me like a good little slave there.""YOU DEVIL!" Pine Orc felt his heart going to explode when he heard this and almost lunged at Jacob."Steele down." Jacob coldly ordered, and Pine Orc was glued to his place with an expressionless face while his eyes were bloodshot.Then Jacob looked at Mr. Observer, who was silently listening with an ashen expression.He questioned sharply, "How many assets does Jerry have?"Mr. Observer was the same as the Pine Orc. He replied without hiding anything, "The Jerry Pawn Shop and all the things within. There is a secret safe on the top floor where he keeps his money, and the deed of the shop is also there."As for his bank account, I have no idea. But his information would be saved in the Zodiac Money Transfer Device in that safe as well. If you have his fingerprint and blood, you can transfer all the wealth to your account."Jacob's eyes shimmered with a hint of delight. It was the real reason he spared these two.He knew Jerry was extremely rich in the dark city, It would've been a waste to leave his wealth like this. He needed money, and Mr. Observer should know where Jerry kept all his wealth since he was his slave.As for the Pine Orc, he didn't know what relation he had with Jerry, but since his strength was also A rank; he didn't want to kill him and wanted to see if he could reap more benefits as well as find the secret of the titan iron.Now, he was extremely glad he spared these two, or he might never know about the Titan Tears Formula and its miraculous effects."We'll do as you suggest. When we returned, start selling everything in the shop and clean the warehouse and logs. How much time will it take?" Jacob asked.He wasn't interested in taking over Jerry's business since it would be too cumbersome, and he had other plans for now after knowing about the titan tears.Mr. Observer pondered for a moment before he answered, "If we bought nothing and sold all the reserves, it would only take 5 or 6 months since we have many buyers. But we can also sell everything to other stores around us. It will take less time, but the profit won't be much."Jacob thought for a moment, "I'm giving you seven months to clean the entire warehouse. Except for the staff remuneration, everything will go into my account. Your saving included. Do you understand?"Mr. Observer felt his heart shattered when he heard the last part and listlessly nodded.Jacob again looked at the Pine Orc who seemed to have lost his soul, and smiled coldly, "How much uncommon titan iron do you need to make one drop of Titan Tears?"He replied listlessly, "As the main ingredient of the Titan Tears, the final quantity depends on the titan iron's purity. Like the titan iron, you sold Jerry. I could make only two Tier-3 Titan Tears Drops with 3000 grams of titan iron with 89% purity.""What is this tier-3 about?" Jacob's eyes narrowed."There are three tiers of purity recorded in the book. Tier-1 Uncommon Titan Tears are made with 10% to 30% pure Titan Iron. Tier-2 with 31% to 70% purity and Tier-3 with 70% to 90%."There is another tier called Perfect-Tier, but it was a mere theory since we required something called Titan Iron Essence, which had purity above 90%. I never even heard of such material."Jacob thought for a moment before he chuckled, "Since you never saw it, this doesn't mean it didn't exist. Nonetheless, I have over 120KG Titan Iron, and I need you to turn it into the titan tears while teaching me the entire process.""So much? Where do you get it from?" Pine Orc couldn't help but questioned when he heard the titan iron amount. Jacob thought for a moment and replied with a subtle smile, "You don't need to know this. Now, let's shut up and let me eat."Without caring about the Pine Orc or Mr. Observer's appalled expression, he tore the crispy leg of the bronze goblin, and starts eating it!

Chapter 113 This Was Way Easy…
﻿The top floor of Jerry Pawnshop,Mr. Observer opened the locked door before he steps aside respectfully.Jacob unhurriedly steps inside the familiar lavishing floor with two bags in his hand.It's been 20 hours since he killed Jerry and Chad.After the rain stopped.As he planned, he took Mr. Observer and Tunny, that was the name of the Pine Orc, back to the Uncommon Dark City, which he didn't plan to return so soon.This time he bought a year-long city pass and first head toward the Potion Tower to take care of Tunny's business.Since he was one of the best Potion Makers of the Potion Tower, the owner was extremely reluctant to let him go and tried almost everything, begging even, to stop him from leaving.But how could Tunny tell him his plight that he simply didn't have the choice since Jacob was controlling him and he might get eaten by this devil at any moment?Jacob didn't mind Tunny's nauseous expression and took him straight to the pawnshop which was still operating fine by the manager. The staff had no idea their generous boss was dead and replaced by the culprit.Even if they knew as long as they were paid for their work, they didn't care who their Boss was or what he did in his pastime. This place was the Dark City. Even a passerby could be a killer.Jacob seized Jerry's seat, looked at the two slaves, and said, "Sit."Mr. Observer sat down, he had already accepted his fate, and besides, he was a slave, to begin with, so it didn't matter much to him. He was even more respectful and obedient toward Jacob because Jacob was extremely powerful. He was also afraid Jacob might eat him if he ticked him off.Tunny was new to being a slave, even Jerry didn't enslave him because of his skills, and it was far better to have him as a partner than a slave.But Jacob simply didn't care about his skills or his importance at all. He looked at him indifferently like he was livestock.However, he knew his fate was now sealed, unless someone can kill Jacob. That made him even more despaired.He sat down while placing a large bag aside."Put it here." Jacob coldly commanded when he saw this guy still didn't know how to read between the lines. He wondered if the Orc race was filled with idiots.Tunny reluctantly put the bag on the table and sighed. It was inevitable.Jacob pulled the bag toward himself and opened it. There were many tools for potion-making and books.He slowly put them on the table and arranged them."Which one is the Titan Tears?" He asked as he looked at the small pile of books.Tunny pulled a dark gray book from the pile that appeared quite old and placed it before Jacob.Jacob curiously looked at the plain cover without any writing. If he weren't controlling Tunny, he would've thought he was messing with him.He opened it and saw the words of this book were completely unfamiliar to him and frowned, "What language is this?""This is the Ancient Philosopher's Language. Every Intermediate Rank member of the Alchemy Guild comes in contact with this language since almost all the ancient alchemy texts are translated from the Ancient Philosopher's Language." Tunny replied with a hint of pride."Intriguing." Jacob's lips curled up, "Since you're so proud about it, then you definitely know this Ancient Philosopher's Language, and you'll be going to teach me this with the potion alchemy."Tunny's expression turned dark when he heard this, but he didn't dare to retort.There were also five bundles of bills on the table with a small bag of coins which were Tunny's liquid savings.Jacob pocketed them without even blinking and then picked up the Zodiac Money Transfer (ZMT) Device and put it in front of the vexed Tunny.He commanded, "Transfer every penny in account number 2245----------"Tunny's fingers trembled as he activated the ZMT Device which was like a phone, and when it was activated, he pressed his thumb on the thumb imprint which had a small needle in its center.It was the activation method of the ZMT Device. Not only did a person require the fingerprint, but a blood test as well to log into the Zodiac Taurus Bank Account. When Tunny was logged in successfully, the entire detail appeared with his bank balance, which was, '32,984,090 Gold Coins. It was his life-saving, but after a few presses, it turned into '0'!Jacob had his own ZMT Device activated, and when he received the notification about the transfer, his eyes flashed with delight.'This was way easier than opening the business and starting from scratch.' Jacob mused.At this moment, he received another notification that he can now upgrade his account from a G-Tier account to F-Tier, and this process can be done with ZMT Device as well.Jacob was content with this bank's efficiency and quickly completed the process that required him to just pressed his thumb on the scanner, and he can now enjoy F-Tier Bank Account benefits.'I should be able to upgrade it up to E or D-Tier with Jerry's account.' He thought.He looked at listless Tunny, who seemed to lose his reason for living, and coolly said, "Set up your workshop in this place, and if you require any materials for titan tears or equipment, make a list. We're going to start after you take a ten-hour rest. You're dismissed."Tunny quietly packed his things and headed toward the other side of the spacious floor, which was more than enough to accumulate a hundred potion workshops.Jacob finally looked at Mr. Observer, who was silently observing them. He wondered if that was why he had this code name.He said in a meaningful tone, "Compared to that guy, I like your demeanor more if you play your part well and do everything I told you. I might set you free before I leave."Mr. Observer was startled when he heard this, and an ecstatic glint flashed past his eyes as he quickly bowed, "I will not disappoint you, Boss! Before what happened between…""Alright, stop here. I understand. It wasn't your fault." Jacob coldly cut him short.Mr. Observer quickly kept his mouth shut and bowed thankfully.Jacob continues, "Now that this is out of the way, show Jerry's secret safe."Motivated, Mr. Observer quickly led Jacob toward the back room.When they entered this room, it wasn't lavish as the exterior, but it was a simple room with some training equipment and a bed in the corner.Mr. Observer moves like he has been in this place many times, and quickly the only bookshelf beside the bed. He suddenly pulled a thin book, and a click sound rang from the bookshelf before a creaking sound of something opening sounded.Jacob smiled when he saw the shelf was just a door, and behind it was a 7X6 feet metal door with a combination lock."So, what's the combination?" He looked at Mr. Observer with uncertainty.From what he saw until now, Jerry seemed to be nothing but an idiot because Mr. Observer almost knew everything about him. He didn't know if that guy was lax because of the parasite gem, but he knew if it were him, he would never let anyone learn so much about him.And Jacob's doubt became even more apparent when Mr. Observer started spinning the combination lock with great familiarity.'Yes, that guy was an absolute idiot. No wonder he even left the formula of the titan tears with that fool. If I were him, I would've escaped long ago. These guys were the perfect pair of suckers. I'm surprised just how they managed to survive this long with a hot potato, like titan tears formula in their hands.'While Jacob was mulling over this, Mr. Observer had already opened the safe."You did great. Tell me the combination and go ask that Pine face clown about what he required and arrange everything. Also, start with the task I tell you about in the cave as well. If any problem arises that you can't handle, report it to me."Jacob gave instructions before excusing Mr. Observer. He didn't want him around when he was calculating 'his' wealth.After Mr. Observer left, Jacob opened the safe's door with anticipation.When the safe opened, there were ten brackets in total. Six of them were filled with golden bills. There were about 10 million worth of golden banknotes or even more.Jacob's lips curled up, as he saw some papers and the ZMT Device with them. He activated it without any hesitation.When the familiar screen appeared, a dismembered thumb appeared in Jacob's hand, which was the only part Jacob didn't eat.It was still warm because it was inside the infinity pendant.Jacob pressed it on the scanner, and the next moment the bank account was flashed open!

Chapter 114 Next Move
﻿'61,400,812'A delightful spark flashed past Jacob's eyes when he saw this number, and without hesitation, he transferred everything to his personal account.This guy's wealth was double that of the potion maker like Tunny because he had his own business in the dark city.The next moment, Jacob received the notification of a successful transition, and the final amount in his account was 94.3 Million. He was only over five million away from having a D-Tier account.He promptly received another notification for an account upgrade from F-Tier to E-Tier. He completed it instantly.As someone who once stood at the pinnacle of wealth, this small wealth wasn't enough to shock him. This fleeting delight only lasted for a moment before he stowed his device away and crushed Jerry's ZMT Device.Every person's ZMT Device was registered with them, and if you want to change it, you have to visit the bank branch which Jacob didn't require.After Jacob was done with the bank account matter, he finally looked at the other things in the safe.Besides money, there were some papers, and after skimming through them. He found the deed of this shop and some logs related to Jerry's business.What caught Jacob's eye were two folded parchments. One was an old map which Jacob mused must be of the ruin where they found titan tears formula.The other was also a map, but the area recorded on it was extremely vast, and there were three words written on top of this map, 'Rarer Races Region'.Jacob's eyes flashed as he examined the map more carefully. He didn't even have the map of the rare region, but now he got the map of the rarer region, he was naturally curious.However, he was fascinated when he saw a marked passage, and his eyes narrowed.'Could it be a secret passage toward the rarer region?' Jacob presumed and decided to interrogate Tunny about it later.After Jacob found out about the titan tears elixir, he knew now he could increase his strength at an extremely fast pace which also meant he required powerful species hearts at some point.Right now, his hunger was 70% eliminated, and with his current wealth, he can buy more rare species' meat and eliminate his hunger completely.Furthermore, he now had a rarer heart and three rare hearts. He might be able to cross the 40% progress with them soon. At that time, he could use the titan tears Tummy would create to subdue his hunger to a bearable level.'I should be able to complete up to fifty percent of my heart progress with the titan tears made with my current titan iron stash. In the meantime, I would learn potion making and that language.'At that level, the rare region might not suit me anymore. But first, I have to completely take advantage of Jerry's position. In seven months, I have to reach the fifty percent progress rate.' An astute light shone in Jacob's eyes.With his current power, he wasn't afraid of anyone in the Dark City, and he prepared a flawless plan for his advancement in these seven months.Afterward, Jacob spotted a familiar yet unfamiliar device and picked it up.'Bloodline Scanning Scale Device? This one seemed to be of a higher grade.' Jacob quickly turned on the 12X14 inches device. It has been a long time since he measured his strength with this device. One reason being the device in his possession no longer showed any date on him, and except for his species, sex, and age, all things were unknown.Jacob saw the familiar menu and pressed his thumb on the needle, and a countdown appeared on the black screen like the old device.A message appeared on the screen."The blood analysis has been completed. Please press the button to check the result!"Jacob pressed the first button without any hesitation."Specie: Human (Uncommon),"Sex: Male,"Age: 25,"Blood Force: 9,000+"(Note: Please Purchase a higher-grade device to measure accurate blood force!)""Bloodline: Unknown,"(Note: Please Purchase a higher-grade device to discover about this bloodline and more information!)""What is this Blood Force? Is it some kind of strength meter of the rarer region?" Jacob mumbled with uncertainty and took a mental note to inquire about it from Tunny as well.He then pressed the next button."Blood Analysis Report:"Unknown Bloodline can't be masseur with the current device!"(Note: Please Purchase a higher-grade device for more accurate blood analysis results and more information!)""Still unknown, huh?" Jacob barely chuckled as he expected this and pressed the last button without any expectation."Blood Lifespan:"Unknown"(Note: Please purchase a higher-grade device for more accurate blood lifespan results and more accurate information!)"Shaking his head, he closed the device. He expected this much since his body has long been mutated and always changing. Just keeping his identity as a human was already a miracle, but he knew it might not be for long as well.After this device, he found a green ID Card that belong to Jerry and he stowed it away since it might come in handy because it belonged to the rarer region. Other than these things there wasn't anything interesting that caught Jerry's eye, and he closed the safe, locking it.He finally has room to breathe.Jacob walked toward the king-size bed and just lay there while staring at the ceiling. He was traveling for months, and it was the first time in a while that he didn't feel any danger or on edge.A strange relief washed over him before he unknowingly fell asleep.---When Jacob killed Jerry, he didn't know a strange single was released, and right after twenty-four hours, a meeting was being held between capped figures at an unknown location."Everyone, I summon you all here to announce two pieces of news." The capped person, who was the only one who was sitting in this room spoke in a horse voice.There were 12 standing figures in front of him and two standing on each side.All of them were attentively listening to him without making any noises.The person continued, "First, it seemed someone from the bank had interfered with our mission in the uncommon region."This time a manly voice sounded in disbelief, "Did they find out about the 'Cannibal Plan'?'"This we don't know for sure yet. But the person who intercepted us was assumed to have 1-Star A-Rank strength and possess at least Type-0 Technology. So, it could also be a coincidence that he was simply just a passerby, but we can't rule out the first possibility either." The sitting person impassively replied."What about the second announcement?" Someone asked in a grave tone."The second is the Rogue Skull NO. A-1389331's brain chip has gone offline yesterday. Which means he is dead.""Rogue Skull NO. A-1389331? You mean that Renegade Hobgoblin we were deliberately keeping alive?" Some asked with astonishment."Yes." The person nodded, "He didn't know we deliberately let him escape with the Titan Tears Formula and had our own plans for him in the Cannibal Plan. But it seemed someone had killed him as well.""Could it be someone had leaked the information about the Cannibal Plan, and now they're hunting our pawns one by one?" Someone exclaimed in a grave tone."Rogue Skull NO. A-1389331's current strength was at 3-Star A-Rank, so it might not be the same person who killed him, and this could be a big unexpected coincidence." The person said impassively, "But if the information leak really happened then there is a traitor among us since only the people in this room know about the Cannibal Plan and its details.""But it's impossible. We all have a Brain Chip implanted in our brains. The moment we say something about the organization or even think of betraying it, our head would explode!" Someone quickly refuted it, and everyone spotted this claim.The sitting person's voice turned icy at this moment, "That's why I didn't take any action. But just to be sure, everyone will go through a throughout scanning. If you guys weren't guilty, there's no need to be afraid."No one retorted or even dared to reject it and quickly agreed."Alright, go to the scanning room first, and then we'll talk."Everyone quickly left the hall except the two on this person's side."What is your plan if they were all clean?" A melodious voice rang from his left side."When the scanning was complete, I hope we won't find anything amiss. I'm planning on sending, Skull NO. A-10000 and Skull NO. A-9999 to the uncommon region for investigation."If this is just a coincidence, they're going to oversee the Cannibal Plan until it reaches the initial stage, and it's time to retrieve the Titan Tears Formula. We can't let it fall into someone else hand." The leader impassively replied."Are you really going to send five-digit and four-digit skulls to that barren place?" An elderly voice questioned from his right."I didn't want to show our true strength until the Cannibal Plan was initiated. But in these past two years, this wasn't the only time we were intercepted. I think there might be someone operating against us!"

Chapter 115 Danger & Progress
﻿Six months later,Two towering capped men entered the Uncommon Dark City, and without stopping, they headed directly toward the City Hall, which was right beside the City Admin Manor, which was at the heart of Dark City.The Dark City Hall was the true operation center of the Dark City.As those two capped men entered the city hall building, they were greeted by a masked receptionist, "How may I help you?"One of them pulled out a Black ID Card, which looked like an exquisite dark crystal.There were only two golden words written at the front, 'Dark Baron', and a golden capped insignia was imprinted on top center. When the receptionist saw them, her eyes went wide.However, before she could say anything, a deep voice rang, "Don't cause a commotion. I want to activate my authority to find someone."The receptionist took a deep breath to calm down. Her excessive reaction was only natural because it was her first time seeing someone with a Dark Noble Identity in Uncommon Dark City.Having the identity of a Dark Noble didn't just represent status, but also strength!One had to know, in the Uncommon Dark City, there was only one Lower Dark Noble but not a single Upper Dark Noble despite its hundreds of years of history.It showed just how difficult it was to achieve the Dark Baron Rank."I understand." The receptionist respectfully replied, "Please follow me. I'll guide you to the manager's office."The Dark Baron stowed his identity card away before he followed the receptionist with his companion, without arousing any unwanted attention.The manager's office was on the second floor, and the receptionist reported the arrival of a Dark Baron, even the usually cold manager lost her composure for a moment before she quickly invited them in respectfully.When only the three of them were left in the room, the manager asked in an edgy tone, "I heard milord wanted to activate your authority to find someone?"The Dark Baron nodded behind his cap and spoke, "It's indeed the reason for my visit."The manager took a deep breath before she solemnly nodded and said, "I understand."Just to be clear, you do understand that once you activate your Dark Baron Search Authority, you won't be able to use it before 30 Days Cooldown period ends."You can only acquire information on one person, and that person's dark city rank should not exceed the Lower-Dark-Noble Rank."In case, the person isn't present in the Dark City, we'll give you the most recent information we have."In case that person never signed in within our database, your Dark Baron Search Authority would not be counted."The Dark Baron nodded in acknowledgment."Very well." She didn't dwell on another topic anymore and quickly took out a tab-size device and activate it and capped symbol flash before a menu appeared.She started touching the screen as she opened a unique menu and put it in front of the Dark Baron, and described, "Please place your Dark Noble Identity Card on this scanner and then your unique Dark Noble Pin."The Dark City was extremely careful with its dark nobles since they have certain privileges within the dark city. So, to make sure only the real person can use them, they had many security measures in place.The Dark Baron was familiar with the process and quickly put the dark crystal card on the device before he typed a long string of *** on the bottom.The next moment, a new screen appeared."Your handprint and blood sample, please." The manager instructed.The Dark Baron put away his ID card and then placed his hand on the can while pressing his thumb on the pin.When the scanning was complete, the manager took the device again.After she was done with the process, she said, "Please deposit 10 million gold coins to Dark City Account or would you like to pay here?"At this moment, the Dark Baron suddenly revealed a wristband, which made the manger's eyes flutter with shock.He tapped on it, and some glowing words appeared on it, and afterward, he tapped a few times before he nodded. "Done."The manager looked at the tab and when she saw a notification, appeared; she nodded and completed the process."Please tell me the ID Name of the person you want to search." She inquired.The Dark Baron coldly replied, "Tunny Pines!"---Jacob currently sat on the top floor of the pawnshop with both Tunny and Mr. Observer behind him, standing respectfully.In front of him sat a short, fat person in a golden mask, while beside him was a masked woman browsing through some papers in her hand."Mr. Jerry, I had to admit when I heard you were selling your establishment, I didn't believe it at first." The masked fatty chuckled at this moment.In these past six months, Mr. Observer had sold every valuable item in the pawnshop just as Jacob instructed him to and earned Jacob 23.9 million gold coins. That was added to Jacob's account and finally made a D-Tier Account.Now, he was selling this shop as well because Jacob had already done with his own business as well. Not only he learned potion making and all the knowledge of Tunny in these past six months shocking Tunny out of his wits.He raised his heart progress to 48%. He had already ten prepared rare heart essence injections for his advancement to the 50%.As for how he does it in these short six months…"But here you are, Mr. Gold. You appeared within half an hour after I put the shop on sale with your assistant. It didn't seem you weren't ready for this at all."Well, it doesn't matter, as you might've already known. I was emptying my warehouse in the past months as well as 'transferring my staff members' back home. I'm simply done with this place." Jacob coolly replied.When Mr. Observer heard 'Transferring' a ghastly chill ran down his spine as he thought how Jacob's home means literally his stomach!He knew all those staff members were lured out of the city every month in the sham of 'transferring to the rare region and a huge amount of gold coins. But the moment they left the dark city. Jacob would butcher them before eating every last bite and then return with a large bag as if nothing happened.Mr. Observer knew all of this because he was the one who prepared those 'Livestock' for Jacob. What made him appalled was just how big Jacob's appetite was, and even devoured 32 staff members three months ago in two days!He clearly remembered to this day Jacob had devoured 218 staff members. Every time Jacob asked him to arrange the 'transfer', he always thought he might get eaten this time like everyone else if Jacob's hunger wasn't quenched.That's why he worked extra, extra hard to do everything Jacob told him and show his value.This was also part of the reason everything was done in six months, and now only this shop was left.Mr. Gold had naturally heard about this, just as Jacob said. He was after Jerry's shop for a long time because of its position in the market area. But Jerry wasn't someone to trifle with. That was why he was paying attention when he received the report that 'Jerry' had stopped buying and even 'shifting his staff out of the city.When he heard the news that 'Jerry' had put his shop on sale in the city hall, he literally flew here to strike first."It's all there, boss." The assistant nodded and put the shop's deed down after making sure it was real.Mr. Gold quickly said, "Mr. Jerry, I think you're a direct person. So, I won't waste your time. I'm willing to pay you 50 million for this shop."Jacob's lips curled up as he said, "Mr. Observer, escort our guest out. It seemed they're not here with sincerity."Mr. Gold and his assistant were dumbfounded by 'Jerry's' response, and when they saw Mr. Observer moved and was really about to chase him out.Mr. Gold quickly said, "Mr. Jerry, there's no need to burn all the bridges so quickly. That was just my price. If you're not content with it, please state your offer. We can negotiate. I sincerely wanted to buy this shop."Jacob nodded and said, "Very well. As you know, my shop is in the most prominent area of the dark city."Furthermore, I won't take furniture in the shop, including this top floor. There's also a secret room behind me, and there are many of high-level training equipment and a high-uncommon grade safe. That is all included within this shop."Mr. Gold's eyes shimmered. "If that's the case then what price do you have in mind?"Jacob stated his last price, "I want 100 million, and this is no negotiable!"

Chapter 116 Monsters Have No Remorse…
﻿"I want 100 million, and this is no negotiable!"Mr. Gold fell silent for a moment when he heard Jacob's response. He knew this shop's actual value was between 70 and 80 million gold coins, and his first price was just a probe.If Jacob hasn't included all the furniture and this whole lavish floor and all the things here, he wasn't willing to pay this much to acquire this shop.Jacob didn't hurry Mr. Gold. He knew this guy wasn't a refuge or criminal like most of the people in the uncommon dark city. But he was one of those rare normal people. He was a pure businessman who had a large chain of firms in many cities.He supplied parts of different firearms and sold some finished products.Jacob knew just how extensive a firearm business could be, and he didn't mind getting acquainted with Mr. Gold. It might come in handy at some point.That was why he agreed to meet with him first, or he didn't mind waiting for others and hearing their offers.Mr. Gold finally spoke with a nod. "Alright, Mr. Jerry, let's sign the transfer papers." Jacob merely nodded and signed the papers with Jerry's name, and Mr. Gold transferred a hundred million into Jacob's account."Mr. Jerry, it's a pleasure to deal with you. According to the agreement, you have to vacant the shop in three days." Mr. Gold was in a good mood as he said, "If you require anything related to firearms in the rare region, please contact me using this pager number."Jacob had already known about the existence of Pagers in the rare regions, and he already bought a new one for himself to make it convenient to contact Mr. Observer.Jacob received the pager number and nodded. "No problem. You can take over this place right now since I have packed my stuff."Mr. Gold was startled for a moment before he nodded without raising any further questions. He even liked 'Jerry's' decisiveness."Let's go." Jacob stood up and signaled Mr. Observer to pick up the two large bags on the corner.The three of them left the top floor, leaving Mr. Gold and his assistant.Mr. Gold couldn't help but ask with a sharp look in his eyes, "What a strange fellow. Do you think it was the real Jerry?"The assistant shook her head. "No. Jerry was burly and taller than this Jerry, and he would've never sold his business he nurtured with his blood and sweat.""Heh, it seemed that stubborn idiot moved on this guy, and we can only imagine his fate." Fear surfaced in his eyes when he thought of Jacob's icy eyes. "It was indeed right to not take any drastic measure against this person and establish a connection. If he can get rid of Jerry, only the City Admit can handle him."Mr. Gold was a businessman, and he had a deep information network. He had been eyeing this shop for many years but also knew just how scary Jerry was. He once probed him and paid a huge price for that.So, he naturally would notice when a new Jerry would appear and when he thought of investigating this impersonator. He was stopped when he noticed what Jacob was doing with Jerry's shop, and he knew he might don't need to do anything and just wait for the chance.The thing that can be handled with money, didn't need force. It was Mr. Gold's logic in doing business.Now, he acquired this shop without offending Jacob, and after meeting him in person; he felt gladder he didn't take that route, or he might not be alive to regret it!Jacob and his two slaves left Jerry's shop wearing capes.When they turned around, two capped figures passed them.Jacob's eyes widened slightly, but he continued to move as if he didn't sense that fleeting danger from one of those capped figures.'Just who could they be to make even me feel the sense of danger for a moment?' Jacob knew his improvement better than anyone else.Someone who could make him feel a sense of danger just by walking past him can't be just any random nobody.Nevertheless, that person wasn't here to mess with him and he was leaving this place. There might not even meet again, so he thought little about this and hailed a carriage."Hmm?" An astonishing grunt sounded from a capped figure as it turned around to look at the empty corner."What?" the other man inquired in confusion."Nothing, I felt danger for a moment." She replied with uncertainty."Stop joking!" The man retorted. He clearly didn't believe his companion. "Not even the City Admit can make me feel danger, much less you. Now be serious. We still have another place to go before we deal with this nuisance that made me spend ten million!""Heh, you're right. It must be my imagination. Let me eat this fellow after retrieving that book. I'm feeling quite hungry after this long trip." The female chuckled and starts moving again."Hmph, don't kill anyone in the dark city. Although we can raise this place to rubble, we can't handle the consequences. Besides, we were strictly ordered; not to cause any trouble." The man quickly refuted."You think I don't know? You're planning to enslave him before taking him out of the city to interrogate him. Just let me eat him afterward. Oh, and enslaved 10 more Common Tier-6 or higher tier species for me. How about we enslave the City Admin as well? His Common Tier-9 meat will taste quite good, right?" She asked like a curious child.But her companion felt a chill in his spine and remained silent. He knew if they weren't together and from the same organization, she might've eaten him as well!Just like that, they entered the Jerry Pawnshop!---Jacob and his two slaves left the Uncommon Dark City and moved deep within the mountains before stopping.Mr. Observer and Tunny's hearts tighten when they were stopped by Jacob.They knew since Jacob had already done with his business with the Dark City and sold everything; it was finally their turn.Truth be told, Mr. Observer was still a little hopeful that Jacob might really set him since Jacob had yet to take his money despite him offering it to him multiple times. But Jacob simply rejected him. It gives him some hope.As for Tunny, he had spent far more time with Jacob than Mr. Observer in these past six months, and Jacob never showed any emotions and merely used him as a library to learn knowledge.Furthermore, he never thought Jacob would really learn Potion Making in six months and reach his level. Even someone as talented as him took decades to achieve this level.If news got out about this, the Alchemy Guild might do anything to recruit Jacob in their main branch.He wasn't just a monster who could eat anything and everything; he was also a monster who could learn anything and everything!This was the final conclusion Tunny reached, and he even felt somewhat gratified to teach such a person. Even if he died now, he really didn't have any regret, and he had made peace with it.But some part of him still hoped Jacob would spare him out of remorse.However, when Jacob's hand suddenly blurred and stabbed right into his chest, realization dawned upon him in his last movement.'Monsters have no remorse…'It was his last thought before Jacob gouged his beating heart out!Jacob merely looked at the still-beating heart and then at Tunny's corpse.He then shifted his eyes at Mr. Observe, who took a step back as he felt stared at by a devil!"Take out an empty box, collect his blood, and dug out that parasite gem while you're at it," Jacob commanded.Mr. Observer controls the shudders and quickly does as he was told. He takes out a metal box, starts filling it with Tunny's warm blood and digs the parasite gem out.After collecting them, he handed them to Jacob with trembling hands.Jacob took them, placed the heart in the box, and put both of them in his 'pocket'.Then he looked at Mr. Observer, making him shake controllably. He chuckles, "As I said before, you're free from now on. But your parasite controller will remain with him."You can try to dig it out in the future, or you could live it with that gem in your head. But as long as you live with that gem, you can't tell a word about me to anyone or write them or hint anything."If this much freedom is enough for you, you can leave, or I don't mind collecting your heart as well for my 'collection' as well. I'm already suffering a huge loss to let you walk away with a rare-grade parasite gem."Mr. Observer nearly cried when he heard those words. He felt like they were words of salvation and quickly blurted, "T-thank you. I won't try to destroy this gem ever, even if I got the chance!"

Chapter 117 50% Completion
﻿Jacob merely chuckled when he saw how grateful Mr. Observer was. "Don't flatter yourself. Even if you manage to get rid of that parasite gem, do you think you can get rid of me if I decide to hunt you down?"Mr. Observer felt a chill when he heard those words. Jacobs's fear was deeply rooted in his heart now, and he won't dare to cross Jacob even if he had ten lives."Don't worry, boss. This gem will be proof of my loyalty. I can't ask for more." He quickly kneeled."Alright now, leave before I change my mind." Jacob waved his hand in annoyance."W-what about you? Aren't you coming with me?" Mr. Observer was confused.Jacob squinted his eyes coldly and said subtly, "Do you really want to know?"Mr. Observer cursed himself for being an idiot and not reading between the lines and whiffled his head. He quickly stood up. "Again, thank you, Boss. You're the best."Done finishing, he ran away without stopping. He was clearly afraid Jacob would still lust after heart, literally!Jacob smirked when he saw Mr. Observer running away like a scaredy-cat despite having a peak b rank strength.He really meant what he said that day, and since Mr. Observer really did an excellent job in these past six months, he let him go.Truth be told, if not for Mr. Observer arranging those 'staff members' every month, he won't be able to convert his body at the same level as his 40% completed heart or reach a 48% progress rate and close to fifty percent.Although Mr. Observer knows about Jacob's strange hobby of collecting the heart after killing his prey. But he didn't dare to question it and even helped him sometimes to collect them despite being disgusted about it.Jacob shook his head. He was destined to be alone on this path and there was no need for him to make relations with others.He glanced at Tunny's corpse and mumbled, "I never thought my learning abilities will reach such a level with my strength. You were the only one who knew besides me. So, I can't let you walk away with this secret. But I bury your remains as a token of my appreciation toward you."In these last six months, Jacob had a far deeper understating of himself. Not only his physical strength was rising with his heart, but his mind was becoming sharper, and his learning ability was already at the level where he learned complex potion-making in six months.He knew this kind of ability could be a disaster and a blessing at the same time.From experience, he knew people in power tend to control those who can shake their position when they matured. If they can't control them, they would simply destroy them to get rid of future trouble.Especially if your talent lies in the field of intellect and has ambition!He was still a stranger to this world and its complex power structure. If he let his guard down and relaxed, he might be the next Mr. Observer and Tunny for another Jacob.That's why I was completely ruthless with Tunny.After he buried Tunny beside a tree, which only took him five minutes.Jacob picked up his bags and left the area in the completely opposite direction from the rare region at full speed, which was now over 300mph!Strangely, he was moving in the Humane Kingdom's direction!After moving for three hours at his top speed, he finally started to exhaust himself. He didn't take the long safe route back because he didn't require it any longer. He was even hoping that some rare animal would jump on him.Furthermore, he found a small water stream and a small natural cave. He decided to rest here for the night and absorb the ten rare blood essences he had prepared beforehand.'This should be enough to cross the fifty percent threshold, and I'm already prepared for this advancement,' Jacob mused as he closed the cave entrance with a boulder."Cursed Immortality!"Jacob summons the book and opens the progress page,_______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 48.00%…_______He then took out the injection and injected it without any hesitation.Furthermore, this syringe was custom-made with titan iron because those normal syringes weren't able to penetrate his skin when he crossed the 40% mark four months ago.After the heart essence entered his heart, it turned into a stream of warm energy before it vanished within a minute. It was completely absorbed!He glanced at the progress page._______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 48.02%…_______Jacob had expected this. Tier-4 to Tier-6 heart essence only provides a 0.2 or 0.3 percent increase maximum in his heart progress now, and he can absorb them within a minute.He knew after reaching fifty percent, the rare species will be akin to uncommon species to him.That was one of the reasons he no longer cared about the farm... ahem, Uncommon Dark City.He mused after reaching fifty percent, only if he consumed the entire dark city could he cross the 60% which was simply not worth making the organization behind the Dark City his enemy.Jacob didn't stop injecting another heart essence and then another…After injecting and absorbing the ninth heart essence,_______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 49.09%…_______However, he didn't take the last injection right away. Instead, he speaks, "There's no hidden surprise at the fifty percent, right?"After what happened at twenty percent, he was very careful whenever he was about to cross these thresholds."Why are you such a worrywart? If didn't have any mutant heart essence, then there's no need to worry about anything. Besides, now that you have that potion, is there any need to be cautious anymore?" Immortika annoyingly wrote."Hmph. Do you think Titan Iron grows on trees? Now quit your whining and let me advance in peace." Jacob berated and injected the last injection without caring about Immortika's reply. This time, the process didn't just over in a minute.The infinity-cursed mark in Jacob's heart suddenly shimmered darkly before it grew inker, and from 1 mm in size, it suddenly started to expand.Jacob felt like something had just sewn deep within his heart as he clenched his teeth from the pain.Although this pain was at Jacob's bearable level, it was still not something Jacob enjoyed.If it was Jacob of the past, he might've gone insane already!The infinity cursed marked stopped when it expanded to 1 cm from 1 mm, and the blurry pattern within the infinity symbol also became somewhat apparent, but it was still not clear.Nevertheless, Jacob did not know about it, and he was now feeling relief since the pain had ended, and warmth replaced it.He knew he had successfully advanced and when a sudden hunger rose; he was a hundred percent sure.He glanced at the progress._______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 51.01%…_______'The last injection gave me a whole percent? Nice.' Jacob was content with this progress.A small vial appeared in his hand, filled with black liquid. It was the titan tears!From the titan iron in his possession, he acquired 85 drops of titan tears, and he used 20 drops when he reached the 40% completion rate to quench his hunger by 60%.Now, he had 65 drops, and after he felt the hunger of the 50% completion rate; he knew it was a wise decision to move in this direction.He quickly gulped down the entire vial, which contained 30 drops.The hunger was greatly subdued as warm energy seeped into his body.But soon it completely vanished, and Jacob frowned, 'It seemed now one drop of titan tear can only quench my hunger 1%.'He quickly took out another vial, which have twenty drops of titan tears, and consumed all of them.Jacob felt half of his hunger was now gone, and he was far more powerful than he was fifteen minutes ago.'I should keep the last 15 drops save for now and try sustaining myself with animals until I reach the Earthen Kingdom and find their lode of titan iron. It was indeed the right choice to 'visit' the earthen kingdom before heading to the higher region.'In here, no one will be able to stop me from taking that titan iron, and once I have a sufficient amount of titan tears, I'll leave them alone.'Jacob's lips curled into a devious smile.He wasn't like Jerry and Tunny or anyone else in Dark City, they never bothered with the affairs of the barren, uncommon region.That's why they missed out on the only titan iron lode in the uncommon region that exists in the Earthen Kingdom of Hob Troll.Now, it benefits Jacob, and with his current prowess, those hob trolls would be courting death if they dared to stop him!

Chapter 118 The Cannibal Plan
﻿The Earthen Kingdom was right between the Humane Kingdom and the Aureate Kingdom, and it was the strongest kingdom among the three as well. Furthermore, the Earthen Kingdom had the most fertile lands in the uncommon region.Even the Aureate Kingdom of Green Goblin, which had an allied relationship with the Earthen Kingdom, didn't dare to court the Earthen Kingdom's lands. The reason is extremely simple; strength!Not only the Hob Trolls were physically stronger than any intelligent race present in the uncommon region, but they also had 15 B-Rank mercenaries as well as their Army Marshal was titled the as the strongest warrior of the uncommon region.That's why no one dares to mess with the Earthen Kingdom, especially the Humane Kingdom, which was the weakest of the three and had a poor history in comparison to these two kingdoms.The Earthen City was the capital city of the Earthen Kingdom, surrounded by thick, towering walls.The Earthen Castle was the most eye-catching structure of the entire city, and it could be seen from the city gates.Inside an office in the royal castle,A burly hob troll in lavishing clothes was currently kneeling in front of two sitting-capped persons."Tsk, so, you were living in this lavishing castle uncovered all these years?" A melodious voice clicked her tongue with envy.The hob troll quickly answered, "It was all because of the organization. Without them, I would still be a beggar." His voice was filled with gratitude."Hmph. Yet, you still failed to protect our cause!" A deep voice coldly retorted.The hob troll kept his head low and replied, "I won't deny it, and I'm ready to receive the death plenty." His voice didn't waver when he said those words."Hehe, look who's talking about failing." The woman behind the cape cackled.The man couldn't help but gnashed his teeth when he heard this and refuted, "We both know who is the expert in tracking here. So, don't even think about going there!""Tsk, tsk, if only I could eat you." The woman clicked her tongue in annoyance.The hob troll was speechless by this strange exchange between these two terrifying existences. But he kept his mouth shut and pretend as if he was a statue.The man took to a deep breath to calm himself down and looked at the hob troll, and sternly said, "Although the organization didn't hold you accountable for what happened last time. But a failure is still a failure, and if this happened again, I let her eat you, and trust me, she didn't even leave bones!""Hey! Bones are rather tasty and crispy, don't make them sound so bad!" the woman instantly rebutted.A chill run down the hob troll's spine when he heard those words and quickly nodded in acknowledgment."Stop interrupting me!" The man was vexed, "Tell me, how long will it take for Cannibal Plan to enter the initial phase?"The hob troll thought for a moment before he replied, "After our last success, it would only take about 3 to 4 fourth months to make another cannibal. But we required a huge supply of human blood, which is the most crucial ingredient of the Cannibal Formula."Without human blood, the Cannibal won't have any growth potential, and from our research. The stronger a human, the more potential a Cannibal has. The previous one was killed by that hidden expert. It was made with C-rank humans' blood, and its potential was of a rarer species while it was born as a rare species.""Interesting." The man sounded intrigued, "Is the Human you speak of the uncommon race which had the secret enzyme the organization has been searching for all these years?""Yes. Although humans are considered uncommon without any special traits or abilities. But they're like a clean slate, and if they had means they can grow and adapt extremely fast. I had yet to see the extent of their bloodline. That's why the organization even bothered to enter this kind of place." The hob troll answered truthfully."Heh, just some primitives who had some shit luck to catch the attention of our organization. If not for that enzyme, they might be already extinct by you guys." The man sneered coldly.The hob troll didn't retort since it was the truth."Just start the mass production. Since we're here, there's no need to hesitate any longer. The uncommon region is our sanctuary, and it's time to utilize it." The man coldly ordered.The hob troll hesitated for a moment before he timidly said, "What about the three hegemonies? If we start a mass slaughter, those humans in the three hegemonies won't stay still."Especially the Black Knight Order and their Marshal, who is a Reserve Nightmare Knight. Milords already know about the antics of the Zodiac Warriors Alliance. Those guys are always looking for a platform to show off their Fighter Manuals prestige."The capped man seemed to expect this and chuckled darkly, "That group of lunatics are really akin to a hornet nest. But they would only involve themselves if they found a higher being's traces. If it's just an infight between locals, they won't care even if we slaughter some low levels seeds and a talentless reserve.""You mean?" The hob troll's eyes shimmered in astonishment."Heh, start an all-out war with the humans." The woman giggled with a hint of excitement.The hob troll's lips curled slightly as a hint of ecstasy flashed past his eyes. "I'll arrange it right away. The Army Marshal is already our slave. It would only take a week to arrange the armies.""Good, we'll be hiding in the dark, and if someone dares to interfere, we'll deal with them, but don't even think for a second that we are your personal bodyguards. If you were killed by some primitives, this will prove your incompetence and someone will replace you!" The capped man coldly warned.The hob troll wasn't the least bit discouraged by this. He knew better than anyone that only an A rank can threaten him in the uncommon region."I understand." The hob troll solemnly nodded.Suddenly, a panicked voice rang from the outside. "Prime Minister, someone had plundered one of our warehouses of the Titan Iron!""What?" The hob troll was astonished by this sudden news.He knew those titan iron warehouses were the Earthen Kingdom's lifeline, and they were heavily guarded. Furthermore, no one would be foolish enough to raid the Earthen Kingdom unless they lost their minds.But it seemed someone does lose their mind.The capped individuals couldn't help but look at each other at this moment."Call him inside." The man suddenly commanded.The hob troll was confused by this sudden command, but he still does as he was told, "Come in."A hob troll in white robes entered the office with a face full of panic.He was about to say something when he saw the two capped persons sitting on the side. He shut his mouth. Furthermore, he can tell this kind of information in front of outsiders."How much Titan Iron was stolen?" The capped man asked at this moment with a hint of uncertainty."Answer him without hiding anything." The hob troll coldly commanded as he was now sitting in his usual position.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ After the hob troll got the confirmation, he quickly replied, "The whole warehouse was emptied. There was over 250 KG titan iron, and it was gone in a single night without any traces!""It seemed those bandits are becoming bolder and bolder since we ignored them for long." The Prime Minister coldly uttered."Do you think it's the same fish who got away?" The woman in the cape suddenly questioned her companion."There's a fifty percent chance it's the same bastard who stole the formula and also killed that Rogue Skull. The key ingredient is titan iron as well. If it's him, then he made it easier for us by coming here."We were told that the Cannibal Plan progress would be much smoother with Titan Tears and ordered to bring it here in the first place since they had a titan iron ore lode." The man solemnly stated.The prime minister was baffled by this strange conversation as well as the other troll."How many Titan Iron do you guys have in the warehouse, and where is the lode?" The man suddenly questioned sharply.The young hob troll was stumped by this question because it was a national secret, and no one would tell this. Only the royal family and some upper echelons of the earthen kingdom know about this information.Even the location of the warehouses was a secret, and this could be said to be a terrible coincidence.However, the young hob troll was gobsmacked when the Prime Minister spilled the beans."There are 33 warehouses, now 32, I guess. The lode is a few miles away, deep within the forbidden forest. Why Milords are so interested in uncommon titan iron? Is there anything I should know?" He couldn't help but question.This time the woman replied playfully, "It's just a slippery fish who got away before. Collect every piece of titan iron in the mine. We'll be living in that place from now on!"

Chapter 119 Potion Alchemy
﻿A few hundred miles away from the Earthen City is the Sunset Duchy under the Sunset Family.Behind the Sunset Mansion, inside an underground warehouse,Two men were standing in front of a capped man wearing a black mask. Only his piercing amber eyes were visible."My Lord, we just heard the news that the King ordered to move every piece of titan iron from the warehouses and shift them back to the forbidden forest. The lode is also in that place. If not for Duke status, I won't be able to get my hands on this news." A burly troll with a thick beard respectfully told.If other trolls saw him, they would've instantly recognized this troll because he was one of six dukes of the Earthen Kingdom, Sunset Duke. But now he was standing respectfully in front of his masked man like he was standing in front of his King.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ This masked man was naturally Jacob, who appeared in the Earthen Kingdom two weeks ago and directly enslaved the Sunset Duke and his eldest son.It was simply more convenient to have the locals working for him while he remained in the shadows. Furthermore, someone like the Sunset Duke would know the whereabouts of the titan iron.His guess was right and just three days ago, with Sunset Duke's help, he raided a titan iron warehouse and gained over 250KG titan iron ores.He also didn't have to worry about hiding since the sunset mansion was quite huge, and he could use it as his backyard. No one would think the loyal sunset duke was hiding a national criminal in his home.The Sunset Duke was also his eyes and ears in the earthen kingdom.Jacob's eyes shimmered with uncertainty. 'Why are they collecting all the titan iron at the same place? Aren't they responding excessively? I just raided a low-level warehouse, and they're already panicking.'Well, since they're going into all this trouble to collect all the titan iron in a place, I can simply intercept them, and get a sufficient amount of titan iron. I can't carry a large amount of titan tears with me even if I want to.'So, there's no point in showing myself. I never intended to take all the titan iron in the first place. They can guard it as much as they want.' Jacob's lips curled up into a mocking smile.Although he wanted to empty the entire titan iron vein of the earthen kingdom and convert everything into the titan tears. But he knew it was impossible.First, there were three more auxiliary materials required to make the titan tears. The Golden Grass, the Vintage Leaf, and the Night Dew. Although these materials weren't as rare as titan iron, they were still rare in the uncommon region. There might not be enough to make even 2000 drops of titan tears.Second, Jacob can always get more uncommon titan iron in higher regions. He wasn't like Jerry or Tunny, who were hunted by the rarer region. No one knows he had the titan tears formula.Lastly, Jacob knew the more he progressed, the lesser the uncommon-grade titan tears affects him, and he would require either a large supply of uncommon titan tears or a higher-grade potion.That's why he only wanted to make enough titan tears that could let him safely pass through 60% and 70% level hunger.In the meantime, he would search for the materials to make the higher-level potion.Since Jerry and Tunny can't find those materials in the rare region, it doesn't mean Jacob won't be able to find them in the rarer region as well.He was completely confident in roaming unhindered in the rarer region after crossing the fifty percent mark. So, there wasn't any need for him to bully those trolls so much."Alright, find out the convoy routes and the amount of titan iron they were carrying. I need them before they reach the final destination. Now, go." Jacob coldly ordered before he closed the door.The underground warehouse was quite large, and there was an enormous pile of titan iron ores.On the other side were three different piles of materials, which Jacob made the Sunset Duke purchase at any price.At the other corner of this warehouse was a large stone table with glass test tubes and other stuff required for potion making. It was like creating chemicals in a chemistry lab.From Tunny, Jacob had learned that the Potion Alchemy was just a minor branch of Alchemy, like the Gunsmith Guild, Apothecary Guild, and the Apothecary Alchemy Guild. And these were just the branches that were in the rare and rarer regions.He also learned that if one wanted to learn true alchemy and entered the main Alchemy Guild, it was compulsory to be proficient in these branches. At least one had to be a Grandmaster in at least three branches.There were three levels of Apprentice Rank, followed by Basic, Intermediate, Advance.After these ranks were the Master Rank with the same three levels. Then there was the Grandmaster Rank, which was the pinnacle of any alchemy branch.There wasn't any single Grandmaster Rank present in any branch of the rare or rarer regions.So, to achieve a grandmaster rank in all these branches was night impossible, and many believed that it was just a hoax made by the alchemy guild to keep them in check.But what truly made Jacob fascinated and want to learn about alchemy was their knowledge. Although this knowledge wasn't as advanced as quantum physics, The Physics of Time & Space, or algebraic number theories which he was familiar with.Yet, he found their traces in the Gunsmith Guild library, and those low-level books made his foundation more refined.That was why he believed he might be surprised when he proceeded to the higher regions.Jacob now considers this world like an onion. He was just at the first layer of this world, and he had already experienced so much here.That's why he didn't dare to think of himself as superior anymore, just because he had more knowledge than the natives of the uncommon or rare region.His goal was immortality, and to reach that goal, he'll do anything as long as it made him come closer to that goal.Jacob turns on the furnace before he tosses titan iron into it. It was the first step in making the Titan Tears. He was required to melt the titan iron in the furnace.After it was done, he was required to use the night dew, which was like dark mercury. The night dew would clear the impurity, turns the molten iron state into a pure liquid form, and make its melting point to room temperature.Then he was required to use a mixture of Golden Grass and Vintage Leaf.The moment he mixed those two, a huge reaction occurred.Deep black smoke rose from the bicker as if a cloud was being made. This black smoke didn't have any smell.However, Jacob didn't dare to touch it because this black smoke was acidic, and he had prepared a special vacuum to collect the smoke so he could release it in the air at night, or it might draw some attention.After the smoke stopped, only a tiny amount of black liquid was left which was the titan tears!Jacob was already at a 65% conversion rate of his body, and he was planning to make it hundred percent so he could achieve and use the full strength of 50%.Furthermore, he still hasn't activated his Fluid Acceleration. A part of being he was afraid, and a part was he didn't have any chance or he didn't know how to accelerate his heart rate at 10 HBPS.It was quite risky if he tried a force method and then had no power left to concentrate to control the fluid acceleration.He also hadn't had the chance to continue his water meditation since it wasn't required any longer after his body had no longer expanded.Nevertheless, he was planning to continue it when he was done with the titan tears matter.Jacob then spent all day making titian tears and used 100KG from that pile.After consuming all the titan tears he had made, his hunger was completely gone. He was laden with unimaginable strength. He mused he was trice stronger than he was at 40%, and his speed also increased by at least 50 KMPH.At this moment, a knock rang on the door.Jacob's lips curled as anticipation appeared in his eyes.He opened the door and saw it was Sunset Duke.Sunset Duke respectfully handed over some paper to Jacob and said, "My Lord, these are the convoys routes. The largest of them is holding over 2 tons of titan iron while the smallest one is keeping 100 kg."Jacob didn't even look at the reports and coldly asked, "Where is the 2 tons convoy at this moment?"

Chapter 120 Start Of War
﻿The Forbidden Forest of the Earthen Kingdom was the most guarded location after the royal castle.Not only this forest was filled with poisonous animals and apex predators, but a powerful army squad patrolled the central area as well, and they were far more vicious than anything present in the entire forest.The reason being there was an extremely precious Titan Iron Lode in this area which was discovered a few hundred years ago when the Earthen Kingdom foundation was established.It was the lifeline of the Earthen Kingdom's economy.But this lode was almost exhausted by the excessive mining. Nevertheless, the Hob Trolls still didn't vacant this place, and they were determined to undermine every piece of ore from this lode.There was a small stone building where the superintendent of this mine lived.At this moment, the superintendent was respectfully standing in front of a capped man with fear in his eyes.He said, "M-my lord, last night 2… 2 tons of titan iron were stolen!" His legs turned into jelly when he felt a ghastly aura from the capped figure."Useless thralls!"A deep icy voice sneered in anger and the next moment thereafter, the hob troll's head suddenly blew into bits!"It seemed we underestimated this fish. It's a cunning one." A melodious voice sounded with a hint of ecstasy before another capped woman entered the room."Hmph!" the capped man grunted coldly, "He had already got two tons of titan iron, and we don't know about other materials of the titan tears formula. So, we might have to wait before he runs out of the stolen titan iron and approaches this place.""Heh, do you think he'll come for more?" The woman suddenly asked playfully."What do you mean?" The man questioned.The woman catwalk into the room as she said, "He's not coming back for more.""Oh, how can you be so sure?" He was uncertain."You're just a muscle brain, sigh…" the woman lamented. "Tell me in these two raids, what was common?""Titan Iron?" The man coldly replied."No. Don't you read the reports that there weren't any traces of a carriage or any vehicle moving the titan iron in the first raid on the warehouse? This time, the convoy was completely destroyed, and only the container was taken away."This means whoever stole the titan iron had used no means to carry it. I can understand the 250KG even though I can carry it with one finger. But 2 tones will take me at least one hand while you have to use your full strength to travel with this much weight." The woman's voice went serious in the end."So, you're saying this person might be as strong as me?" The man asked in disbelief."Maybe, but he's not far away. So, tell me how much something made with a Tier-3 Common Material can affect your strength?" The woman asked another question.The man was startled before he blurted, "It won't affect me at all, but if I took in a large quantity, then it might make some difference. But only once!"Now I understand that motherfucker won't need this level of titan iron anymore after consuming over two tons of it! Didn't this mean we'll let him escape again?" His voice was filled with indignation and helplessness."Hehehe, you see, that's why I called you a muscle brain." The woman suddenly laughs in a mocking tone, a dark red light suddenly glowed between the cap as two crimson eyes glow with bloodlust, "Now we just have to visit those people who know about the convoys routes as well as to check their purchases in these past few days. We might catch our little troublemaker fish. I can't wait to eat this cunning fish…"A chill ran down the man's spine when he heard this, and a scary proposition surfaced in his mind, 'Could it be all of this was just a trap set by this crazy bitch?!'--- It had been an entire week since Jacob had stolen the entire container of the titan iron, and he was locked in the underground facility while making the titan tears.He was almost done, and only a little over five hundred kg of titan iron left.If not for the other two materials shortage, he won't take a break until he was done.Jacob exited the underground warehouse to get some fresh air.'I have successfully made over fifteen hundred drops of Titan Tears, and with the remaining titan iron, the grand total would be around seventeen to eighteen hundred drops.'Well, this much is enough for me to cross two more limits, and till then, I'll be able to acquire the materials for the higher-level elixir. I can finally leave this place…' Jacob looked at the cloudy sky with some expectation.Jacob also absorbed the heart essence of Tunny, who was a tier-7 Pine Orc, and it only raised his heart percentage from 51.01% to 52.06%.Which made Jacob somewhat depressed because he was used to getting this much from a rare species, but now the rarer species were adding 1.5% to the heart's progress.This means, by the time he reaches 60%, this number would further drop between 00.06 to 1.00.Jacob now had a deep understanding of how percentages would add to the progress rate as he grew stronger and stronger.'It seemed I have to skip the rare region…' Jacob thought deeply.At this moment, he heard hurried steps and looked in the direction he was the Sunset Duke's son was rushing toward him with a pale face."What is it?" Jacob coolly questioned.The young hob troll answered while panting, "W-war!"Jacob's eyes narrowed. "What war?""An all-out war between our kingdom and humane kingdom! It was just announced, and everyone was ordered to get ready for the invasion." The hob troll answered while catching his breath."All-out war, invasion? Did they provoke you guys?" Jacob asked curiously.The hob troll shook his head. "I don't know, but Father has to make a trip to the capital. The King summoned every noble to discuss the invasion plan. I was here to report it to you and deliver the materials Lord ordered. They have arrived."However, the supplier told me that this would be the last batch of these materials and we have to wait a couple of months for a new batch, and it might even take longer because of this abrupt war." The young hob troll seemed quite excited when he spoke about the war.Not just him but the entire Earthen Kingdom was in an uproar because of this sudden war declaration. The hob troll species were innately warmonger and savage. They even support this decision and shower their King with praise.However, the Humane Kingdom was completely baffled by this sudden declaration. They never provoked the two kingdoms and even pay taxes and tributes to the two kingdoms as a peace offering and always remained low-key.The King of the Humane Kingdom even sent a diplomatic envoy to inquire about why the trolls suddenly turned hostile and do anything to stop this madness.But on the same evening, the envoy's head was delivered back. It was a silent message, 'Fight or Die.'Many human cities went into a state of war and some noble and weak humans fled the kingdom toward the common region without any hesitation.The Earthen Kingdom was the strongest of the three kingdoms, and it would be akin to death by fighting this already lost war. So, fleeing seemed to be a better option.However, the trolls seemed to have gone completely mad as they even sent 2/10th of their armies to the common region to hunt down every last human.It appeared they simply didn't want to let any humans live anymore.Jacob was astonished when he heard just how far trolls were going against humans.'Something is not right with this war…' Jacob thought with a frown, but he couldn't put his finger on it.Nevertheless, he didn't want to be involved in this mess, and he wasn't a hero, either. The previous owner of this body was traded as a slave to Decker, so Jacob didn't have any goodwill toward humans as well.'It's not like they're only humans as an intelligent species in this world…' Jacob shook his head. He ordered the young troll to shift all the materials into the warehouse.He was planning to refine the remaining titan iron if he could and then leave this place for good.Just like that, two more days pass,As expected, the humans were getting slaughtered by the trolls on the battlefield. Only those mercenaries and knights were putting up a fight, but the trolls seemed to be playing with them as any of their B-rank experts had yet to join the battle.Jacob was completely oblivious to this.Right at this moment, two capped figures enter the Sunset Duke's mansion as if they were on a stroll."Hehe, see? We caught our fish!" The woman chuckled darkly!
