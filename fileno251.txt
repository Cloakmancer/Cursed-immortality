Chapter 251 Alchemy Guild Member Benefits
﻿'Welcome to Alchemy Mission Application!'Alchemy Guild ID: Faceless Ancient'Current Rank: 1-Star Alchemist (Reserve Alchemist)'Next Rank: 2-Star Alchemist (Reserve Alchemist)'Mission''Promotion Mission Available: 1'(NOTE: Complete this mission to get promotion!)'1.

Two of these tasks are related to Medicinal Alchemy, and the last two are related to Weaponry Alchemy.'Didn't this mean that just to become a reserved alchemist, one needed to be well versed in these two disciplines and their branches? The alliance really looked too simple in comparison. I can even earn money by selling my finished product to the guild. Maybe that's why there's no reward mission at all.' He mused as he closed the application.Jacob knew he was lacking in Pill Alchemy and Magic Weapon department at this moment, but he was sure he could easily make up for these flaws. Especially the Magic Weapon, which was the whole reason he was here in the first place.As for Medicinal Alchemy, he can learn as long as he has the knowledge. He already had the basics down for potion alchemy, so pill alchemy shouldn't be complicated.Jacob then directly opened the star network. Just as he thought, the Zodiac Warrior Alliance's private servers were gone, and replaced them were the Alchemy Guild's two private servers.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Without hesitation, he opened the 'Alchemy Market (Rare Plains),' and options appeared thereafter.'Alchemy Knowledge'Alchemy Skills'Alchemy Techniques'Battle Knowledge'So, like the Alliance's 'Alchemy and Technology,' the Guild also has 'Battle Knowledge,' but the difference between the two is quite clear. Both sides have superficial knowledge about each other department.' Jacob snickered as he had already explored the alchemy-related knowledge the alliance had, and he was pretty disappointed.So, he wasn't too optimistic about the Guild's battle knowledge. Still, since this place was called the treasure trove of knowledge, he couldn't judge them by other's standards.However, Jacob was interested in the alchemy knowledge, the actual core of the Alchemy Guild, so he opened it.'Weaponry Alchemy (Rare Plains)''Medicinal Alchemy (Rare Plains)''Languages for Alchemy (Rare Plains)'Jacob thought for a moment before he curiously opened the Languages section just to see what kind of language was available in the alchemy guild, especially their prices.Thereby, a list appeared, which made him astonished.'-Rune Language: Basic Type-0'Price: 50 ZC'-Rune Language: Intermediate Type-0'Price: 150 ZC'-Rune Language: Advance Type-0'Price: 300 ZC'-Rune Language: Basic Type-1'Price: 1000 ZC'-Philosopher's Language: Basic Type-0'-Price: 10 ZC'-Philosopher's Language: Intermediate Type-0'-Price: 50 ZC'-Philosopher's Language: Advance Type-0'-Price: 150 ZC'-Philosopher's Language: Basic Type-1'-Price: 500 ZC''Are they for real?' Jacob was really shocked when he saw those prices, and he felt like he had stuck gold in the champion space.Not only the alchemy guild's languages were divided into different ranks, but the type-1 rank only had its basic information. There was nothing about intermediate or advance knowledge at all.'Then the champion shop is even more precious than I thought previously.' Jacob thought as he opened the weaponry alchemy section.'Forging Guide: No Rank'Price: 10 ZC'-Magic Weapon Crafting Guide: Basic Type-0'Price: 100 ZC'-Magic Weapon Crafting Guide: Intermediate Type-0'Price: 1000 ZC'-Magic Weapon Crafting Guide: Advance Type-0'Price: 2000 ZC'-Magic Weapon Crafting Guide: Basic Type-1'Price: 5000 ZC'-Mech Weaponry (Gunsmithing) Guide: Basic Type-0'Price: 50 ZC'-Mech Weaponry (Gunsmithing): Intermediate Type-0'Price: 250 ZC'-Mech Weaponry (Gunsmithing) Guide: Advance Type-0'Price: 500 ZC'-Mech Weaponry (Gunsmithing) Guide: Basic Type-1'Price: 1500 ZC'Mech Weaponry (Explosives) Guide: Basic Type-0'Price: 50 ZC'The list goes on as many discipline guides were on the list, but Jacob was frowning because first, their prices were just off the charts, and second, all the available knowledge was limited to just basic type-1.'I've heard those old men conversation, and they say the types ranks were for technology and materials while the other ranking like common, rare, and such were for strength.'Don't tell me even they got it wrong and just the type-1 basic is enough for the rare plains, and type-1 intermediate and type-1 advance is the ranks equivalent to Epic rank?'No, something is not right. A Senior Grandmaster's knowledge should be at least intermediate or advance type-1 level. Could it be I'm restricted by my guild rank? It's quite possible since my organization does this to keep the members motivated to work…'Jacob thought it was highly likely the case, but he still had to see for himself when he reached the higher rank.He suddenly received a notification at this moment."Amiable Monk Fish sent you 10,000 ZC in your Bank Account!"New Balance: 12,670 ZC"It was the exact amount Ellie promised to give Jacob so he could practice diligently.Jacob scoffed, seeing the new balance before closing it, 'Naïve.'He then tried the alchemy skills section, it was filled with all kinds of blueprints, formulas, and designs related to all the alchemy branches available in the rare plains.Jacob lost interest since he didn't need those low-level alchemy skills, especially anything related to gunsmithing. They were just too low for his standards.As for the alchemy techniques, they were techniques driven by mana and used in alchemy. Although, these techniques drew Jacob's interest. But he met with a familiar blockade when he tried to open this section."You have no Mana. Therefore, this section cannot be opened!""Shit!" Jacob instantly cursed with a clouded, indignation expression!

Chapter 252 A Visitor
﻿Exasperated, he closed the alliance market since there was no physical material on sale there. So, he opened the exchange market and finally saw many alchemy ingredients and finished products on sale posted by other alchemists.Although most of the alchemists sell their goods to the market, they keep precious products to themselves and then sell them to the exchange platform for ZC.Because they couldn't get ZC from the common market, and not all the customers were rich enough to cough up one billion gold coins. So, this place was the best because any alchemist was a walking tycoon especially reserved members of the alchemy guild.Moreover, only an alchemist knows the actual value of rare materials, and all of them need high-level materials to continue their research and increase their skills.So, whenever a precious material appeared, many tried to buy it, and that's why the Guild had installed a particular function called 'Item Auction.'It was pretty simple to use, the interested buyers could place their bids within the time limit of the auction item on the post, and when the time ends, the highest bidder would be eligible to buy that item.Whether it's the seller or buyer, after a successful auction, they can't back down, or they will be punished according to the alchemy guild's rules. That's why no one dared to mess around because the Star IDs were like their identities, and without one, you would never be given access to any high-end place.Jacob was quite pleased with this function since he didn't need to negotiate with the seller and could buy the item directly as long as he won the bid. Furthermore, there was an 'anonymous function' for both buyer and seller.'This Alchemy Guild is quite considerate. Even I started to think the alliance is really a place for brutes.' Jacob snickered as he suddenly thought of materials required for the Blood Insect Enslavement Ritual Array.One by one, he tried searching the materials to see if anyone was selling them. However, he didn't know what these materials looked like yet since he was still far away from completing the encyclopedia.But it didn't mean someone else won't know, either.However, he could only sigh ruefully when he didn't find anything and after thinking about it. He wrote a post with the five materials' names under anonymity and posted it in the exchange market.He will later check if someone responded to it and then close the star network since he wasn't interested in anything else for the time being, especially in rare plains!This time, there was no more disturbance, and he was again absorbed in reading.Three days passed since Jacob was just sitting at his table without moving an inch. He didn't feel hunger or fatigue, just a little bit of mental exhaustion.But it was far better than paying attention to his surrounding and reading at once. Furthermore, he was already half done with Universal Magical Materials (Type-1), and he had already spotted the Rainbow Star Dust and its picture.However, his focus was broken when he heard footsteps approaching, and his eyes narrowed!Thereupon, 'Knock, knock…' light knocks rang on the apartment door.Jacob could hear the heartbeat of this person. It was pretty fast, and he was somewhat familiar with its unique rhythm.He closed the virtual book and headed toward the door before opening it.Rita appeared in a pink dress, flaunting her elvish charm, looking absolutely stunning. Her lips curled slightly when she saw Jacob's masked face and said, "Senior Grandmaster, how have you been?"Jacob didn't want to indulge this woman as he was pretty busy in his own study, so he annoyingly asked, "I'm fine. What do you want?"A hint of resentment flashed past Rita's beautiful eyes when she heard Jacob's dismissive tone. She pursed her lips and said, "Can't I be here to visit a fellow gunsmith?"pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "You didn't inform me. So, you're disturbing me." Jacob said matter-of-factly.Rita was even more annoyed, "How can I inform you when you blocked my ID?" She spat resentfully.Realization dawned upon Jacob, 'So, she tried to find my ID, but she couldn't because of my privilege, and she assumed that I had blocked her.'He knew Rita had already given him her star ID, so the fault really lay on him this time, so he didn't argue with her anymore."I might've pressed the wrong button then." He shamelessly stated as he had no plan of telling anyone about the privilege system of the star network.'Like hell, I believed you.' Rita thought as she glared at Jacob but didn't reveal her thought.Her lips twitched slightly as she said, "It can't be helped, then. As for a reason for my visit, the first thing is I want to inform you that the magic smith workshop has been arranged, and you might be able to use it as much as you like." A hint of pride appeared in her beautiful eyes.'Oh, I almost forgot about that matter. But do I really need to ask for a favor anymore with my current identity?' Jacob thought as this really wholly left his mind since his identity was now vastly different from three days ago.He can easily gain access to any facility in this building as long as he shows the corresponding rank's grandmaster level badge.Still, it might be too cumbersome since these guys would definitely make a fuss if he told them his identity as a permanent member. So, he wanted to hide it as long as possible and even leave without telling anyone."Alright. Since this is the case, then I'll contact you in a week." Jacob nodded and was about to turn around, "Wait!" when Rita quickly stopped him."Is there anything else?" Jacob looked back and frowned.Rita was speechless and had the urge to kick this dismissive guy in the guts. She pursed her lips and said, "Don't you want to know why you could be given a free pass to the facility?""Why?" asked Jacob.Rita curled her lips, "It seemed Senior Braylon had taken a keen interest in you. He is coming here tomorrow from the Dark Inner Circle of the Dark City to meet you!"

Chapter 253 Don’t You Feel Remorse
﻿"It seemed Senior Braylon has taken a keen interest in you. He is coming here tomorrow from the Dark Inner Circle of the Dark City to meet you!"Jacob's eyes narrowed, "You mean the only Senior Grandmaster Magic Smith in Dark City?"Rita nodded with a prideful expression as if she was talking about herself, "Not in the dark city but in the entire rare plains. If I'm not wrong, he might invite you to join as a permanent member of our guild."Rita revealed with a mysterious smile as she thought Jacob would be shocked hearing the term 'permanent member,' but he remained as stoic as ever, which made her lost for words.'I should've guessed.' Jacob thought, but his interest in Braylon only amounted to this much.If it was before he got Ellie's invitation, he might give the guy some face, but now, in Jacob's eyes, Braylon was like any other person in the rare plains, someone he could crush at will!But he can't be too obvious, so he ended up asking about a permanent member as well, and Rita was instantly enthusiastic.She even infiltrated his apartment without his concern and started to tell him about a permanent member. But like any other person on the rare plains, she didn't know what was a permanent member's statue actually meant.She just knows that a permanent member was a genuine upper echelon of the three hegemonies, like Braylon, who was an overseer of the Dark Inner Circle's alchemy branch's business.In her eyes, Jacob really deserved this place since he was the youngest of them all."I ever heard Senior Braylon's disciple in freedom plains is also coming to the dark city tomorrow, and he will be here as well." The moment she spoke about this disciple, a hint of coldness flashed past her eyes as she continued, "That guy's character is like a real piece of trash. Although he's very talented, he's too ruthless and arrogant."She was like a gossiper as she talked about Braylon and his disciple.However, Jacob had no interest, and he suddenly thought of something and asked, "Do you know about Freedom Lords?"He was hearing this term from big characters, so he decided to ask Rita since she seemed to know a lot.Rita glanced at him as if she was looking at an alien, "You didn't know about Freedom Lords despite living in Rare Plains?""No," Jacob answered dismissively.Rita's lips curled up, "You're really like a hermit old man despite your age. Let me enlighten you then. The Freedom Lords only appeared in recent years when the secret about 'Plain Trial' surfaced."It was then that people got to know that the four nations of the freedom plains were under the command of four mysterious existences who called themselves Freedom Lords. They all have unique titles according to the nation behind them."However, currently, we have five freedom lords. You know the fifth freedom lord is actually the infamous leader of Killer Skull Society, which is now recognized as the fifth power of the freedom plains, Skull Kingdom!"In the end, Jacob was astonished because he never thought the Killer Skull Society would reach such an agreement with these four freedom lords.'I really missed out on quite a lot.' Jacob thought with a hint of amusement and decided to check on the star news occasionally."Well, good for them, I guess." He coolly commented.The killer skull society could be considered his enemy, and he knew those guys might come looking for him if they knew he was there or they might already have.After all, he still has their data on the cannibal plan, and from his short interaction with Important Grace, Jacob knew that data was quite crucial to society. So, they might never give up on him until he hands over the data.But he was pretty sure they had to move even more carefully if they wanted to attempt to capture him in Dark City, and with his current strength, he was not overly worried about them as well."Heh, you got that right." Rita giggled as she took his words for an entirely different meaning, "They really chose the worst time to strike such a deal with the Freedom Plains. Everyone knew that they had taken advantage of the Dark Being's looming threat on the Freedom Plains to negotiate the terms of becoming the fifth power of the freedom plains."However, the plain trial was cleared by some mysterious person before anyone could react, leaving both Dark Being and the Freedom Plains in shock. The barrier which prevents the two sides from approaching each other is also lifted because of it."The Dark Beings' Ruler, the Lich King, was furious as he mounted a full-scale invasion on the freedom plains and almost killed three freedom lords. If the newly appointed Grace Freedom Lord hadn't used a mysterious trump card and forced the Lich King to retreat, I'm afraid the freedom plains won't even survive to this day."Jacob was quite alarmed when he heard this, 'I was lucky I didn't encounter this Lich King at that time. Even three of the five most powerful beings were almost killed by him. It quite evident that he was really pissed by the trial rewards snatched right under his nose.'Jacob couldn't help but felt somewhat giddy when he thought about how he pulled a fast one on such a powerful guy, and the price had to be paid by someone else, including the killer skull society.He couldn't help but look at Rita, who seemed to be quite happy gossiping with him like a friend, and it was indeed a long time since he had talked with someone like this.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "Don't you feel remorse for those innocent lives in the freedom plains who were going to be implicated by someone's selfish decision?" Jacob asked Rita, or he was probably asking himself again without any emotions backing his voice.Rita was started by this question as she looked at Jacob's profound eyes, and her lips curled up as she replied, "It's not like I don't care. But what can I do with my meager power? I may as well let them live in my memories. Besides, I wasn't the one who was responsible for their current state."Jacob was in a daze for a moment before his lips curled up, and he looked at Rita before he said something unexpected, "Want to go in my bedroom?"

Chapter 254 Grandmaster Magic Smith, Orville
﻿Today, five over 6 feet tall figures followed by a figure with 5'2 height entered the Dark City, and all of them were wearing black mantles like any average person in the dark city.Those six didn't seem too interested in strolling as they hailed three taxis and soon arrived at the alchemy guild and entered it without giving another extra glance.However, at the edge of the alchemy guild building square, a pair of blue eyes were following their vanishing silhouettes like a hawk.He suddenly whispered, which could only be heard by him, "Those six seemed to be not ordinary."Just as his voice was suppressed under the bustling crowd, a clear, crisp voice rang in his ear, "Who? Everyone looks the same to me.""Hehe, Boss was again staring at some chick's ass." Another perverted voice chimed in."Shut up! You still have the mood to joke around?" The blue eyes boss chided in the same whispering voice."Fuck, the Boss is really serious this time. It seemed the bounty of 5,000 ZC finally made our easy-go-lucky Boss serious." Another male voice rang in astonishment.A hint of helplessness flashed past the Boss's blue eyes, "It's not so easy. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one here to scout the target. I can even smell that Tiger Killer's nasty stench from here. This bounty won't be easy to get our hands on.""You are right about that, Boss. We've been here daily, but the 'informative' still didn't contact us despite taking our money. Do you think he scammed us?" The crisp voice rang in the complaint.The Boss's eyes narrowed dangerously, "His contact info came with the commission, so it can't be fake. We just need to be patient. Do you think the commission reward of the rare plain's history is so easy to claim?""How about I try to infiltrate the higher floors and search for the target?" A deep husky voice suggested at this moment.The Boss rejected it without hesitation, "No, we can't reveal ourselves. According to the mission, the moment we were discovered, we will be abandoned by the bank. The alchemy guild is not to be trifled with. Almost all of our technology came from them, so their home base security will be top-notch."Don't you remember what happened to the infamous thief of the rare plains when he tried to rob the treasury of the alchemy guild? He wasn't even passed first-floor security before he was caught snooping!""Then what should we do?" A woman asked in worry."We'll wait!" The Boss said matter-of-factly as a cold glint flashed past his eyes as he continued to observe like a venomous snake waiting for his prey.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ While many mercenaries were secretly camping in the Alchemy Guild's main entrance.The six newcomers quickly passed the security clearance and reached the highest floor, where they were blocked by Senior Grandmaster Bart and Senior Grandmaster Otto.Both old men had this strange stiff smile on their faces as they bowed slightly in front of the 5'2 feet tall person in front of the group.They greeted in unison, "Grandmaster Magic Smith, Orville, welcome back."Although this seemed strange that two Senior Grandmasters were bowing their heads in greeting in front of Grandmaster Rank. But anyone who knows the identity of this Grandmaster would have no choice but to bow their head.Because Orville was not only a Permanent Member of the Alchemy Guild but also one of Braylon's personal disciples and a very talented one at that.Orville's journey in the Alchemy Guild could be said to be legendary because before he was found by Braylon in the Freedom Plains, he was just a servant of a small family in Light Nation.But he was extremely ambitious, and when he got his hands on some unknown inheritance, it was the turning point of this journey. He ran away from the family he served and then joined the alchemy guild after passing the test.The Light Nation also noticed his talent in alchemy, and like any other talent, they roped him in when he was still in his budding phase.Orville also completely submitted to the Light Nation and appeared absolutely loyal. They invested vast amounts of resources in his growth and even made him famous all over the Freedom Plains.Orville became the most popular Magic Smith in the entire Freedom Plains and was revered by many.It was also the start of Light Nation's nightmare because after Orville showed his talent, he caught the eye of Braylon, and he naturally invited Orville as a permanent member.If it were any other alchemist, they would've thought twice before they broke the contract with the Light Nation. It was a straight-up betrayal, but Orville did it in a heartbeat without even carrying about he was in the middle of their core area.When the upper echelon of the Light Nation found out about his betrayal, they were naturally furious. Rumor has it that they wanted to enslave Orville in secret.But to this day, Orville is still living in the Light Nation like a King, and the Light Nation never does anything to him, which is the strangest part, and it is shrouded in mystery about how Orville did it.As for Orville's popularity, it skyrocketed even more, and there are many biographies on Orville's life, but no one knows how much truth was in them.However, one thing which was common in those stories was Orville's cruelty. He was portrayed as an inhuman monster who experimented on all kinds of living things, including innocent people of different races. Some even claimed he tortured his victims and enjoyed the whole process.There were thousands of deaths under his belt.But there was still no proof to this day that it was true or not, and Orville had never come out to explain himself as he seemed to care less about what was going on around him, and he was always in his lab, doing who knows what.However, the people closer to Orville knew all those rumors weren't even half the things this guy had done to reach this point!

Chapter 255 A Spy Of Society!
﻿Orville removed the hood from his face, revealing his ash-gray goblin face. A golden monocle was resting in front of his left beastly eye. Although he looked like a scholar, there was a strange vile vibe around him that made anyone think twice before approaching him.Especially his sharp eyes, which seemed to be cut right through any fabric and see every part of their body.Orville's lips curled up, revealing his beastly white teeth as he looked at Bart and Otto's stiff, smiling faces. He said in his hoarse voice, "Seniors, you're giving me too much face. Please accept my bow.""There's no need. You're too polite!" Bart horridly waved his hands as his smile stiffened even more."Yes. You, young fellow, visit after a very long time, so we are very happy to see you." Otto also quickly denied it as he was much more natural at showing his fake expression than Bart. Still, a hint of apprehension was deeply hidden in his eyes.Orville's smile widened even more as he nodded, "You both truly treated me quite well. It seemed the others were still busy with their own matter that they even come to greet me." Orville sighed ruefully.However, a chill ran down Bart's spine as he suddenly sensed a chilling aura leaked from Orville for a moment, and Otto was the same.'Just many people did he kill to develop such a baleful aura?' Otto thought gravely.Still, he didn't dare to voice it out and pretended not to notice anything and said amiably, "Hahaha, Yong Fellow, you sure miss everyone, and I would like to inform you that everyone missed you a lot as well. It's not like they were reluctant to meet you, but they are gone to the inner circle city gate to receive your Master."A peculiar light flashed past Orville's eyes when he heard 'Master' and said smilingly, "If that's the case, then I come at perfect timing. I should greet Mentor personally. It's been quite a while since our last face-to-face chat."He then looked back, and his voice turned emotionless as he said, "You five will wait on my old floor meanwhile. Number 1, lead them there."The cloaked figure, who was 7 feet tall and standing in the middle of the five, bowed in acknowledgment. And after Orville left the lift, he operated it and headed to the floors with the magic smith facility.Those two old men didn't say anything as they knew that Number 1 was Orville's most precious test subject and also his bodyguard, and every time Orville's appeared here, he would bring a new guard with him. Orville turned around as his smile returned to his face. He suddenly through an unexpected question at those two, which caught them off guard."If I'm not wrong, Mentor is coming here for the newly appointed Senior Grandmaster, right?"Otto replied without hiding it, "Yes. Senior Grandmaster Jack is really a rare genius in the mech department. It's not a surprise Senior Braylon wanted to meet him."Orville's lips curled up in a strange smile as he asked, "If I'm not wrong, his Star ID is called 'Faceless Ancient,' right?"Otto's eyes shimmered in a peculiar light as he nodded, "Indeed. It appeared You, young fellow, also interested in Young Friend Jack, huh?""Of course, how could I not be interested in the youngest senior grandmaster of our Rare Plains history? Senior Faceless Ancient is worth my respect. It's just a pity that he can't join our true ranks. What a pity." Orville sighed ruefully as he shook his head as if he was feeling really regretful.Bart was startled by this sudden comment by Orville, "Why would Young Friend Jack won't join our ranks? He's a true alchemist, and I'm sure he would be thrilled to join the guild as a permanent member."Otto, on the other hand, remains silent as a mocking sheen shines in his eyes while looking at Bart. He clearly knew what Orville was implying here.'This old idiot has nothing but pills in his head.' He thought jeeringly.Just as Otto suspected, Orville dropped a bombshell on Bart."That's the actual case, Senior Bart." He sighed ruefully, "If I'm not wrong, Senior Faceless Ancient is already a permanent member of Zodiac Warrior Alliance. Unless there's no second ID with the same name, he can't join our side as a permanent member at all. What a waste of talent."Bart was flabbergasted when he heard this unexpected piece of news and blurted, "How can that be? Have you mistaken him for someone else?"Bart has a very good impression of Jacob, and he pays attention to him, and he is quite pleased with Jacob's hermit demeanor as he didn't leave his lab to socialize with other grandmasters at all.In a sense, Bart sees his younger self in Jacob, who is full of potential and has nothing but alchemy in his heart. The person who recommended Jacob to Braylon was also Bart as well.However, now he heard that Jacob was already a member of the alliance, he felt that fate was playing tricks on him.With a regretful expression, Orville revealed, "I hope this was the case. Because a few years ago, another person with the same name as Faceless Ancient became the center of attention in the Star News. Someone leaked the information that he joined the Alliance as a permanent member because he was a blanker."However, strangely, he got kidnapped by the Killer Skull Society after a concise period of time after he joined the alliance. Thereafter, he never made a public appearance again, nor did the Nightmare Knight Legion comment on it."But this incident case quite a strife among Night Commander Nixon and the Killer Skull Society. However, now another Faceless Ancient has appeared in our branch. I couldn't help but wonder if they were the same person." He said with a sly sheen in his eyes.Otto, who was pretending to be shocked, finally blurted, and the words he spoke were out of Bart's and even Orville's expectations."Could it be he's a spy sent by the Killer Skull Society to sow discord among Dark City? Don't forget Dark Extermination Order on Killer Skull Society Members is still valid!"

Chapter 256 Tell Him…
﻿Both Bart and Orville looked at Otto in unison when they heard his absurd reason. Orville, in particular, has this strange glint in his eyes as if he were mulling over something.While Bart was more direct and retorted with a frown, "Don't spout nonsense. Even if Jack has some connection with the Killer Skull Society, if he's really a permanent member of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, then do you think the Dark City will dare to kill him?"The Dark Extermination Order of the Dark City was no secret to anyone. It was the highest rank kill order issued by the Dark City, a kind of wanted order the city would release against their enemies.Normally, this order is only issued against individuals, but a few years ago, the Dark City released this order against the entire Killer Skull Society!This leaves many curious about what society had done to make the Dark City so furious, but the reason remains a mystery to this day.Anyhow, this makes the life of the skulls extremely difficult in Dark City, and they all have to hide their real identities and tread extremely carefully whenever they are inside the Dark City.Not only that, but many people who were interested in becoming Dark Noble were hunting skulls like mad dogs because it would give them Dark Merit Points, which generally could only be earned by clearing Dark Missions.That's why those skulls didn't dare to reveal their identities because once discovered, anyone could kill them in Dark City; there was no punishment.Now Otto's calling Jacob a spy from the society was putting a huge target above his head, and if this kind of rumor was spread, even the Alchemy Guild won't be able to middle if Dark City decided to act.However, Jacob's identity as a Permanent Member would still give him at least a chance to come clean.Because every skull will have a brain chip inside its head, and there were many ways to detect them in the Dark City. So, this accusation could be easily resolved. Still, it would be a stain on the person's reputation.Otto also knew this, and he was planning to use this method to cause some strife between Dark City and Jacob. At the very least, it would make him leave the Alchemy Guild building.But this plan was supposed to activate after Braylon's visit. However, now that Otto saw Orville's unusual interest in Jacob, he knew Orville was up to something here, and he couldn't be good. So, he just lit the fire and decided to see if the winds would come or not."Oh, my mistake. It was just a slip of the tongue. How could young fellow Jack have belonged to that society of misfits? It could be that he was able to escape from their grasp. We should ask him some time on a drink." Otto laughed in embarrassment as if he really blurted it out without thinking.Everyone knew the Dwarf race was quite straightforward, so Bart nodded in understanding while Orville merely chuckled without saying anything.Afterward, Bart and Otto led Orville toward the meeting room, where the meeting would start after Braylon's arrival.As for Jacob, they no longer mention him again since they knew things would become apparent in this meeting. Jacob was already invited by Rita, so he should be here. At least, that's what they thought.---Jacob, at this moment, was still reading the book and had been since Rita ran away after his abrupt 'invitation.'Still, she didn't forget to slap him, though, which dodged by Jacob without much effort. This only made the blushing elf even more embarrassed and furious, and she could only run away while calling him 'scoundrel beast.'However, Jacob has little impact since he was used to the term 'one-night stand' and wasn't embarrassed at all after being rejected. It was just a fleeting emotion that was suddenly aroused after he heard Rita's answer.Now, he has completely forgotten about it as he was immense in his studies. At least Rita won't look to disturb him anymore, and he will look for her himself when he wants to enter the magic smith workshop.As for Braylon, he was even less important.However, when another knock on his door rang, Jacob knew he should create a sign of 'Do not disturb' and hang it outside his door.But he knew it wasn't needed because only a few people could approach his door because his apartment was inside a Senior Grandmaster Rank level workshop, and not anyone could enter.Furthermore, if Jacob had bothered to look around the facility, he could have easily discovered a function of this facility that would completely block it for even the Senior Grandmasters.Frowning, Jacob stood up and moved toward the door as he knew it wasn't Rita because this heartbeat was quite different from hers.Just as he opened the door, he looked down and saw a gnome standing there with a pale expression. He was the same gnome who led him to the test facility when he was taking the Senior Grandmaster test."What is it?" He coldly asked.The gnome named, Cidery felt he was standing in front of a terrifying existence and quickly blurted, "S-senior, I'm your floor assistant. Please forgive the intrusion, but I just received a message from the top floor that Senior Braylon has arrived, and now everyone is waiting for you."Jacob remained expressionless, "Why are they waiting for me?"Cidery was speechless by this response and didn't know how to answer, so he uttered while stuttering, "I-I-I do… don't k-know!""Then go find out." Finished saying, he closed the door before Cidery could react.Having no choice, Cidery could only run away to get the answer with an ashen expression.This was his first time experiencing such a situation. Usually, a senior grandmaster would just go as long as they were summoned to the top floor without asking for any reason. However, Jacob not only didn't go, but he was asking for a reason.Thereupon, Cidery again came back with a pale expression and knocked on the door again. When Jacob appeared with the same dismissive look in his eyes, he quickly reported, "They say Senior Braylon wanted to meet you!"Jacob then nodded his head before he closed the door leaving one sentence behind when he almost made Cidery faint with trepidation."Tell him to get his ass here if he wants to meet me!"

Chapter 257 Are You Qualified?
﻿On the top floor of the Alchemy Guild's building, the meeting hall was fully occupied with top figures of the Alchemy Guild in the Dark City.Everyone was looking at a handsome elf sitting on the chair of honor. He was wearing a scholarly gray robe, and he had this amiable scholarly aura around him that made everything feel closer to him. He was none other than the Senior Grandmaster Magic Smith, Braylon.However, the atmosphere of this meeting room was not joyous as a few moments ago, as everyone had different expressions on their faces. Most of them were shocked silly.As for why they were shocked, it was all because of Jacob's response to their summoning. Not only did he not appear despite being given an invitation, but upon summoning, he even asked why he was being summoned.This wasn't even as offensive as what he said after he was given the reason. According to the floor assistant, Jacob bluntly said if Braylon wanted to meet him, he could come to his workshop.This was a blunt provocation and slapped on Braylon's face, who was probably the most respected figure in the alchemist circle of the Rare Plains. Everyone gave him a face, but Jacob just didn't play by the rule at all.Bart, who was sitting two chairs behind Braylon, quickly said with a stiff smile which was quite ugly even for him, "Senior Braylon, please don't take offense by the lack of manners by Senior Jack. You see, he's a kind of eccentric and always behaves like this."Although Bart was angry as well, he still decided to defend him because Jacob didn't break any rule here, and he was in the complete right. They were the ones who were disturbing him, and he was not like these old guys who were losing interest in alchemy after their progress stagnated for decades.They were all like Rita as they were happy with what they had already achieved, and their ambitions were now exhausted. That's why they no longer do long research.Only official alchemists like Braylon and Orville, who still have huge alchemy potential, were always busy with their research and seldom made appearances.Braylon also appeared only because he got spare time, or he would never have made an appearance if Jacob had gone there and requested an audience with him.Everyone in this room knows in their heart that Jacob had done nothing wrong, but they were all forgotten about the true essence of alchemy which was to find the truth about everything!"Why are you still defending him? This is a blunt disrespect toward all of us, not just Senior Braylon!" Senior Grandmaster Spell Crafter, Lawrence slapped his hand on the table angrily.Everyone nodded in agreement with Lawrence's words since Jacob was going too far by not showing them any face. "Heh, don't be so angry, Old Lawrence. He's still young and inexperienced, and who didn't have a temper when they were young? Furthermore, don't forget Senior Jacob is arrogant by nature because of his potential." Otto sneered as he also took a stand for Jacob.But his last words were quite vicious since he was directly calling everyone talentless by bringing out Jacob's potential. He had indirectly created scorn in everyone's heart for Jacob."So, what if he's full of potential? This didn't mean he could be disrespectful toward his elders!" Senior Grandmaster Apothecary Boone refuted with a cold glint in his eyes."Elder? He has the same rank as us. If you want to talk about the age factor, then I'm afraid you're just a toddler in front of Senior Bart." Rita retorted with narrowed eyes. But she had this strange pinkish hue when she spoke about Jacob, and a hint of resentment flashed past her beautiful eyes.'Although he's a beast, he's still a beast of my Gunsmith apartment. I'll deal with him personally!' She thought as she silently glinted her teeth, and her blush intensified.It was her first time seeing someone so direct as Jacob, who said it bluntly that he was after her body while he didn't even bother to show his face at all. The more Rita thought about it, the angrier she became.She even wanted to use the Silver Killer to teach Jacob a lesson, but when she thought about the formula of friction killer, her heart always wavered, and a complicated emotion gathered in her heart.At this moment, Braylon, who was didn't speak a word since hearing Jacob's reply, finally spoke, "That Young man is really interesting."Everyone looked at him and was speechless when they saw Braylon smiling instead of fuming.Orville, who remained silent all this time without saying anything, finally spoke coldly, "Mentor, he's just over his head by his small success." He was the only Grandmaster present in the meeting of the Senior Grandmaster, and only he dared to raise his opinion without fear of anyone.Braylon's smile suddenly vanished as he gave Orville a side glance which was somewhat cold as he said, "Do you think you, a Grandmaster, are qualified to comment on a Senior Grandmaster half of your age?"It was a simple question but sent chills down everyone's spine as they knew Braylon was taking Jacob's side and even chided Orville.Many felt better after looking at Orville's ugly expression because if they talked about seniority in front of them when he was still a grandmaster.Orville didn't dare to retort in front of Braylon anymore. He was only afraid of Braylon in this entire building.He respectfully bowed his head toward Braylon, "I was wrong. Please forgive me, Mentor. Everyone, please forgive me. I shouldn't have spoken."However, when his head was lower, a ruthless glint flashed past his eyes and quickly vanished.Braylon expression softened, and he nodded his head, "Your temperament is still the same. As long as you let go of your ego, you'll be able to become a Senior Magic Smith."Everyone nodded in agreement since the path of Magic technology was entirely different from mech technology."I'll remember it." Orville nodded before he returned to his seat and became silent as if he wasn't there anymore.Braylon stopped paying attention to Orville and looked at everyone as he smiled amiably and said while standing up, "Let's go meet Senior Jack!"

Chapter 258 Jacob’s Act (1)
﻿After giving his impolite reply, Jacob returned inside, but this time he didn't start reading right away and instead headed toward the bathroom to take a shower.As for the repercussions of his blunt disrespect toward Braylon, he was worried in the least bit. It could be said Jacob was looking forward to Braylon's reaction.Because he wanted to see if Braylon was another hotheaded, power-hungry idiot or if he was someone with patience and looked at the bigger picture, Jacob knew he had done nothing wrong by rejecting the request for this abrupt meeting.After taking a long relaxing shower, Jacob headed toward the kitchen for the first time in a while, as he was now used to eating raw meat because of his particular situation. But it didn't mean he enjoyed that; he was just flexible.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Jacob nodded in satisfaction when he saw the entire kitchen was filled with all kinds of ingredients, herbs, and even spices. But before he could even light the stove, his eyes narrowed as his moments came to a halt.'19 people?' He was really speechless when he heard so many footsteps approaching, 'Don't tell me those guys really wanted to cause trouble.'His eyes turned cold as his masked appeared over his face before his silver head was covered under his hood.Without waiting for them to approach the apartment door, Jacob had already opened the door and walked outside, and all those footsteps came to an abrupt halt.Those Senior Grandmasters were startled when Jacob appeared when they were only a few meters away from knocking on his door.At the very front, in the lead, Braylon was also quite surprised before he started to look at Jacob's tall and muscular figure from top to bottom.While Rita's eyes flashed with anger the moment she spotted Jacob's masked face and bit her lips."Aren't you busy, Senior Jack? Don't tell me you were playing plank on us and were just coming to the meeting room?" Otto couldn't help but jollity comment.But this comment made many narrow their eyes, especially Orville, who was looking at Jacob in scrutiny.Jacob glanced at the Dwarf, who looked quite silly, but he always had this strange feeling of foreboding whenever he saw him. Still, he wasn't interested in indulging the dwarf right now as he looked at the handsome scholarly elf who was smiling amiably at him."Senior Grandmaster Braylon, I presumed?" He uttered emotionlessly.Braylon nodded in acknowledgment with a friendly smile and replied, "In the flesh. And you, sir, must be Senior Grandmaster Jack. You're indeed extraordinary."Jacob narrowed his eyes ever so slightly as he didn't feel any kind of malice from Braylon at all, and he was speaking earnestly. This slightly evaluates Braylon's image in Jacob's eyes."I'm nothing worth mentioning." Jacob coolly stated, "I know you come from a long way to meet me. But I only heard about it from someone else, and it doesn't seem to be a request either. So, tell me, do you think what I just did was wrong?"Everyone was shocked by Jacob's blunt disrespectful question, which was quite piercing to the ears.But before Braylon could reply, Lawrence beat him to it and berated, "Presumptuous! Is the way you treat…ekk…"However, before Lawrence could finish, his words came to an abrupt halt because his throat was grabbed by a menacing claw, and his words were jammed within his throat.But what gobsmacked everyone was who claw it was. It was none other than Jacob who had somehow appeared from right in front of Lawrence in a blink of an eye and from over five meters away.Furthermore, the most shocking fact was Lawrence, who was an Extraordinary-Tier-5 Kobold, got manhandled by Jacob without even being able to put up any resistance at all.Jacob's cold voice rang at this moment, awakening everyone from their stupor, "According to Alchemy Guild's rule #31, if someone entered a personal workshop of alchemy without his permission, this action can be taken as an offense toward the owner of that workshop. Thereby, the owner can take drastic measures such as he can kill a non-guild member and, in the case of a guild member, breaking one limb as a first and last warning. Then he should be thrown out of the owner's workshop and forbidden entry for the rest of his life. Am I right, White Sage?"The entire workshop was deadly silent, and only Lawrence's whimpers could and choking sounds could be heard.A mechanical voice suddenly buzzed from Jacob's wrist at this moment, "Alchemist Faceless Ancient state no false!"Everyone's expression changed because they all were familiar with this AI voice. It was the Alchemy Guild's AI, the White Sage, who could monitor their every move while they were on the alchemy guild's property.But they almost forget about it since they only interacted with White Sage when they were exchanging resources and received its notification from the alchemy guild.However, no one had ever used White Sage like Jacob just did, and their expression started to pale when they heard Jacob's following words."Then I want to confirm another thing, according to Alchemy Guild's rule #513, if an alchemist is using the alchemy guild's property for their own personal use, like holding an event which involves more than 10 Grandmaster Rank Alchemists without informing the guild, what is their punishment?" Jacob's coolly asked without any ripple in his voice while he was still choking Lawrence.White Sage's voice rang again, "The punishment is those alchemists involved in such an event will strip off one rank from their current rank!""Then what if they have been doing it for a long time?" Jacob asked again, but this time no one was in the mood to listen.Braylon quickly spoke as his smile had now vanished, and a stern look replaced his amiable one, "Senior Jack, you stated your point. There's no need to do this anymore. Senior Lawrence, not all of us were gone too far by barging into your workshop without any prior arrangement. We'll all compensate you for your trouble."Everyone nodded in agreement as they were now entirely spooked by Jacob's current attitude, especially his ruthless personality was now apparent."Senior Jack, it won't happen again. Just give us all some face." Bart was sweating buckets now as he looked at the young man who was holding a kobold like a baby."Stop it now. No one will disturb you anymore." Rita also chimed in with a complicated look in her eyes as she never thought Jacob was so strong, not to mention ruthless.The White Sage's static voice sounded again, which sent shivers to almost everyone in this room, "If they do it more than three times, they will expel from the Alchemy Guild!"

Chapter 259 Jacob’s Act (2)
﻿"If they do it more than three times, they will expel from the Alchemy Guild!"Jacob ignored the ghastly expression on everyone's faces and looked at Braylon, who was looking at him with narrow eyes. His lips curled up before he said, "If I'm not wrong, White Sage informed about these infractions to the Guild Leader of the Dark City. But for some reason, the Guild Leader never took any action, so these guys always go as they pleased. So, let me ask you, Senior Braylon, are you the Guild Leader of Dark City's Alchemy Guild?"Jacob had spent some time looking through all rules and regulations of the alchemy guild after he became a permanent member. He found many interesting things there, but he never expected he would be using them so soon and like this.He now got thoroughly annoyed by this group of nuisances, especially those old members who were acting like a bunch of bootlickers as if they could ride on Braylon's coattail while the other guy clearly didn't give a damn about them.Especially when he felt extremely malicious intent from the goblin standing right beside Braylon, it was like he was meeting Decker once again, and this brought back some very bad memories.So, Jacob just decided to teach them a very painful lesson as well as harvest some benefits. If these guys didn't show up, he won't have done it, but now that they were here, he would not let this chance pass by.Braylon narrowed his eyes as he replied, "I am indeed the acting Guild Leader of Dark City. Why don't you let Senior Lawrence go before he dies? This didn't need to get any uglier."Braylon was no longer polite and amiable as before. But now he was quite apprehensive of Jacob and vigilant.Because from start to finish, Jacob has never shown any discomfort or a sliver of fear as if he was utterly in control which was not a very comfortable feeling and a first for Braylon.The truth was he came here with another motive besides meeting him, or he won't even be bothered by the appearance of another Senior Grandmaster Alchemist if it was any other person than Jacob.But things suddenly started to go south the moment he met Jacob, which was simply too abrupt, no matter how much Braylon thought about it.Not only he but the other alchemists were now completely silent because they were afraid that they would replace Lawrence if they annoyed Jacob, so they let Braylon talk.This all damn thing started because Lawrence interfered in their conversation, so they no longer dared to utter anything, as Jacob was even more dangerous than Braylon since he didn't care about their faces.Even Bart and Rita, who have some goodwill toward Jacob, were now complete silence because from start to finish, Jacob didn't even look at them, which was a clear enough indicator that Jacob didn't care about them at all.Bart was still fine, but Rita felt knives stabbing in her heart as she saw just how indifferent Jacob was toward her as he didn't even bother to reply or react.Jacob really didn't care about any of them as he never even considered them his equal from start to finish. They were just like passersby in his eyes, who would be left behind once he left the rare plains, so what was the point of creating connections?Jacob replied to Braylon as his voice turned appalling, "Even if I kill him. I won't suffer any punishment at all. Do you agree with me, Guild Leader?"Lawrence started to struggle even more intensely after he heard what Jacob had just said.Braylon was now really alarmed as he could tell Jacob wasn't joking at all. After a very long time, a feeling of fear started to surface in his heart.But he quickly hid his fear and said in a cold tone this time, "Look, we all make mistakes by coming here, and I'll personally take full responsibility for this and compensate you."I know you are a permanent member of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, and no matter what kind of mistake, it's not a place of the Alliance to interfere with the guild's affairs. I can easily revoke your temporary guild membership, which won't benefit you at all. Just let him go, and we can have a nice chat."Everyone was shocked at this revelation, even Otto and Orville, who were quite sure that Braylon was here to recruit Jacob. But it turned out Braylon was hiding the fact that he also knew about Jacob's background and feigned ignorance all this time.This made them even more curious about his true purpose for coming here, and he pretended not to know about him.Jacob's lips curled up behind his mask as he looked at Braylon, who was now coldly looking at him, completely different from his amiable self a few minutes ago.'Crack…'At this moment, an eerie sound of bones getting crushed rang in the entire workshop, and a chill ran down everyone's spine because they knew where that voice came from. They all looked at Lawrence, was now stopped struggling, and Jacob's hand was now completely clenched around his neck before he released him.'Thud…'When Lawrence's lumpy body fell on the ground, everyone's heart skipped a beat."Y-you killed him…" Braylon spoke hoarsely while feeling he was dreaming. A Senior Grandmaster Rank figure was killed right under his eyes, and he was watching like a fool.However, before anyone could react, Jacob vanished from his spot again, and this time, he appeared only a few inches away from Braylon.Braylon's heart almost jumped out of his chest as he wanted to retreat by using his magic, but he was simply too slow, and before he knew it, Jacob's hand was placed over his shoulder, and he froze as he could feel the aura of death enveloping him.Jacob's icy voice rang as he looked Braylon straight into his horrid eyes and said coolly, "As an acting guild leader of Dark City, not only do you collude in breaking the rules with other members."You take a direct part in infiltrating my personal workshop without any prior notice by using your rank. Even if I kill you hundreds of times, not even God can find fault with me. "Yet, not only did you dare to threaten me by using your measly authority, you even have the gal to lie to my face? Who the fuck do you think you are?"Jacob's voice was now like a death knell to everyone's ears, especially Braylon, who seemed to have lost his soul!

Chapter 260 Now Chose!
﻿Braylon's breath was caught between his throat and mouth as he looked at Jacob's icy amber eyes while Jacob's hand was placed over his shoulder. Despite wanting to retaliate, he can't.Although Jacob wasn't holding him like Lawrence, but with how easily Jacob had appeared right in front of him and placed his hand over his shoulder and suppressed Braylon, an extraordinary-tier-6 elf, it was quite apparent that he was the strongest in this room.No one expected things to escalate to such a point. They only gathered today because of Braylon and came here because of him as well. However, now they were regretting it so much that they wanted to curse Braylon for provoking that death star.Alas, it was too late now, and even if they wanted to run, after seeing Jacob's speed, they gave up on the idea and were completely silent as they didn't want to get noticed by Jacob at all.Even the usually arrogant Orville was like a timid mouse and didn't dare to look at Jacob anymore and was doing his best to hide his presence. He finally understood why he was able to join the alliance and why it was the most powerful organization of three hegemonies.'Is everyone in the alliance a monster?' He thought and felt extreme fear when he thought about how he was scheming against Jacob.Otto also had the same thought trails as Orville.At this moment, a crisp voice rang in the silence, and the source of this voice was Jacob's wrist."Sir Jack, you have killed a person in the Dark City, which is a violation of the city's three ironclad rules!"It was the voice of Dark City's AI, Dark Rose, which has the right to monitor anyone with a Dark City Pass. Everyone knows this since it was written in the guidebook.Everyone's eyes shimmered as they almost forgot where they were standing, the Dark City!The rules of Dark City were not a joke, as the three hegemonies also had to pay the price if they dared to run rampant in the dark city.Although Jacob killed Lawrence, who was an alchemy guild member, he killed him inside the dark city. Even if he had done it according to the alchemy guild's laws, he had broken the dark city law while doing so.Braylon's felt a ray of hope, but he didn't dare to say anything unless Jacob decided to kill him out of annoyance. After all, Jacob's hand was inches away from his throat.But this didn't mean the others would let this chance go, especially a sly goblin like Orville. His eyes shimmered maliciously as he quickly blurted, "He's also going to kill my mentor! Quickly do something. Send the inner-city guards!"Braylon's expression wrapped, and his face turned pale like a ghost. He roared, "You beast!" He wanted to kill Orville since his cry for help was nothing but a death sentence if Jacob really decided to kill him now."I know, but this matter has nothing to do with Dark City, he deserved to be executed, and I have the authority to execute him. I have done it according to the Alchemy Guild's rules. You can confirm it with White Sage, and if you find any fault, I'm willing to take full responsibility." Jacob coolly stated without any hint of fear.Now that he was an official member of the guild, he knew he had some authority over branch guild members. Moreover, the guild has to protect him, and since he didn't do anything wrong, even the dark city will not find fault with him.But if he had done the same thing to any other hegemonies' members without behind their permanent member, no matter how right he was, Dark Rose won't have even bothered to inform him and directly send guards to detain him.Everyone was dumbfounded by Jacob's nonchalant attitude as he really didn't seem to be bothered by breaking Dark City's rule at all.But before they could process the entire thing, Dark Rose's voice rang again."I have confirmed the credibility of Sir Jack's claim. But you still have to pay 100 ZC as a fine for the violation of the rule of Dark City, and you can't kill anyone anymore for three months, or you will no longer be welcome in the dark city!"Jacob glanced at his wrist before he said, "Alright.""Thank you for your understanding. Please enjoy your stay, Sir, Jack!"With that, the problem was solved under everyone's dumbfounded eyes, but they soon regained their sense and finally breathed in relief after hearing the last words of Dark Rose.Jacob can't kill anymore, even if he is in the right. Of course, it was the condition that he cared about staying in the dark city.But they failed to catch the fact that from start to finish, Dark Rose called Jacob with honorific and didn't even mention anything about killing him or detaining him and just said he would not be welcome in the city anymore.They didn't have time to think about it as well since Jacob again looked at Braylon, who was now looking at him with fear and hope. If he managed to escape with his life today, he would never come back and hide in the inner city as long as this lunatic was here. With his current state of mind, he also didn't notice the fact that White Sage really stood up for Jacob."Heh, do you think I can't drag you out of the dark city? Or do you really think you could save in the inner circle protection after three months? As for leaving the dark city, you guys are a bunch of spineless dogs who were hiding in this place for years without going out, and this might not change anytime soon with all those dark beings wreaking havoc out there."Even if you cowards collect some courage, trust me, I'll be there. Waiting for you outside where no one can stop me or find any proof that I did it. I can assure you of that in the least." Jacob's voice became colder and colder until his killing intent enveloped the entire room.Those alchemists started to tremble while sweating profusely while Braylon, who was experiencing that ghastly killing intent up close, was on the verge of kneeling.Jacob uttered with a cold smile on his face, "Now, Senior Braylon, you will hand over your authority as the Guild Leader as well as empty your account as well as your storage ring, and I will consider this matter over between us."He then turned his eyes toward the others and coolly said, "As for you lot, I'll be satisfied with your empty accounts as ramification. Or I can always make your life worse than death. Now, choose!"
