Chapter 11 Finding A Path
﻿Jacob focused all his willpower on the sliver of that mysterious energy and tried to move it upward toward his neck, but no matter how much he tried, he met with some invisible barrier.Suddenly, Jacob opened his eyes and saw a little bit of red flowing in the green liquid right in front of him.'Blood?'Jacob quickly found out where this blood come from. It was from his nose. He won't have known if he didn't feel warm on his nose so suddenly.'Is it because I was forceful with that energy just now?' Jacob could only think of this plausible explanation.Although he wasn't entirely sure, he didn't dare to take any more chances. He still didn't know what this energy was or even if it was energy to begin with. He didn't want to cause too much self-harm, which he couldn't comprehend.'But why is it resisting in this area while I can easily move it to the other part of my body?' Jacob fell deep in thought.'Could it be? It's not moved freely around as I thought and follows some kind of vine channel, and it follows some kind of pattern, like… like what was it called again?... I clearly remember reading it in the old Buddhist medicine when searching for a way to extend my lifespan… Cha-Chakra Points… right?'Jacob remembered something like Chakra Points that exist in legends at this moment because he was obsessed with extending his lifespan, and there wasn't anything he hadn't read that could help him prolong his life.It was another story, though, since nothing worked in the end, and all those legends have very minimum effect on over ninety years old Jacob. He was left with only one choice: to use all his influence, favors, and a massive chunk of his wealth to buy advanced machinery just to live like a living corpse.However, even advanced medication wasn't able to save him from death.'But there were only seven main chakra points, and they're all located in the torso and head, which means it possibly can't be legendary chakra points? Then there were also Meridians Points which were also related to inner energy as well.' Jacob mulled over the information he had collected and read in his past life.But he didn't remember anything clearly, since it was tens of years ago. He only remembered superficial information.'Sigh… well, it's not like I need some proof or anything, nor did I have the luxury of time to think over all these legends. Let's see. Even if this energy is following chakra points or meridian points, then I think first I needed to circulate this energy all over my body just like my arm and then try to go for my neck and head?'Jacob simply went for it since he won't lose anything by doing this, and he might be able to succeed in the end. It's not like he had somewhere to go right now. He was just floating inside a glass cell.Thereby, Jacob again sent the energy toward his left hand and paved the way for the energy into his other fingers…---It was Day sixty-five since Decker was gone.Pig-Head would move toward a small metal door on the floor every three days, right in the center corner between two glass cells. He would open it, fill a rope bucket of blue liquid from inside, and then drink it before returning it to his old position and staring at Jacob's naked figure floating in green liquid with his listless pig eyes.One very noticeable thing about Jacob's glass cell was that the light green liquid inside had become lighter as if it was losing its potency slowly.Jacob also started to feel sleepy because of it, and he would sleep after doing his daily routine of carving a path for the sliver of energy inside his body.Jacob naturally noticed the change in green liquid and started to feel dread when he thought about the possibilities after this green liquid completely lost its effects. He couldn't help but thought that he would die of hunger or drowning.Although he didn't feel hungry or need to breathe inside this green liquid, it would still lose its effect, just like medicine, and it needed to be refilled.He even wonders if Decker will be back before he dies tragically. However, he didn't put his hope on Pig Head because, after observing him for over two months, he knew this guy was a complete idiot with no will of his own, just like a puppet who followed orders blindly!However, he strongly didn't want Decker to come back, not before he clarified his theory about this energy.Jacob noticed that after he was done with his left hand, his progress of carving a path in his right hand was much faster, and today he finally completed it.Now he was going to start working on his torso and legs without any delay…--- Day 134, it was over four months since Jacob and Pig Head were left alone in his darkroom…It wasn't dark before, though. But, just a few days ago, the source of light, which looked like a bulb, suddenly dimmed down and stopped working altogether, making the entire place descend into darkness.But for Jacob or Pig Head, this didn't make any difference.Jacob started to sleep for over ten hours because the effect of that green liquid was becoming vaguer and vaguer.However, Jacob still didn't feel any hunger or feeling of drowning, which made him reach an astonishing conclusion that after this green liquid completely turned transparent, he might fall into complete hibernation.Because Jacob always fell into a long sleep without even him noticing, which left him started for some time, but he soon saw that it was probably because of this liquid he was floating in, and it might have different effects from his assumption!

Chapter 12 Restriction & Freedom!
﻿This extirpated Jacob's fear of dying out of hunger or drowning, but this also put an unknown fear in his heart.If he fell into hibernation, then he won't probably be able to wake up on his own, which also meant only Decker would be able to wake him up once he came back.Jacob didn't want that at all because he was so close to completely circulating the sliver of energy into his body, only half of his right leg remained, and he knew it would mostly take him a week to complete it as well.He could not rest if he didn't see the result of his theory, which was also the only hope of leaving this place alive. Even if this hope was based on his delusion, it was still hoped that kept him going.'Although I can't do anything in this darkness, I think I slept for thirteen hours this time or probably less or might be more. This gives me probably thirty or forty more days before I might fall into hibernation. Fuck if that pig idiot just refiled this green liquid….'Jacob cursed Pig Head in his mind before again turning his focus on doing his labor again!---Day 148,Two more weeks passed, and Jacob's right hallux was moving up and down as Jacob was quite excited about this moment.It was clear that he had finally been able to move the sliver of that mysterious energy all over his body, and only his neck and head were left.'The moment of truth!' Jacob's heart was galloping at this moment.With a thought, the energy moved back to his heart from his big toe. He didn't immediately send it toward his neck. He decided to circulate the sliver of energy in his entire body before going toward his neck, forming a pentagram just for a silly reason, which was that he read in a novel once.Jacob slowly controlled the energy and started with his left arm before going to his right and right arm and left leg… he didn't feel a damn thing, making him silently blush…'I should've never believed in those damn stories….'Jacob didn't dwell on his embarrassment for too long, quickly controlled the energy, and slowly moved it toward his neckline.Jacob's eyes instantly contrasted when the energy… didn't meet any barrier like last time!'Hahaha… so, I was right about my approach!' Jacob was elated and wanted to laugh out loud, which was out of his character. But who could blame him since this little success meant there was still hope for him!Jacob quickly settled himself down and crawled the energy toward his head. He thought it would also cost him some time, but to his astonishment, the energy moved toward his head with no restriction or need for an alternative path, making him even more excited.When the energy reached his skull area, Jacob thought it might come out of his mouth, but it didn't, and as it was moving to the back of his skull.Jacob quickly restrained his ecstasy and observed his head very thoroughly. He knew the restriction placed on him was probably here.'Nothing in the back of my head…' Jacob found nothing behind his skull area, which was the most expected area where the restriction might be, but it wasn't. However, Jacob wasn't disheartened and moved the energy toward the top of his skull, and he met with the same disappointment. Jacob was a bit panicked, but he still didn't lose hope and commanded that energy to move toward his forehead.At this moment, when the energy was right above his glabella, it suddenly met with a barrier that wasn't a natural one Jacob felt from his body.Jacob's eyes instantly flashed with a sharp light, 'Found you!'He was a hundred percent sure that he had finally found the thing restraining him because he had been controlling this energy for months now, and he knew how it felt like when he met with a natural barrier or blocked pathways.This thing wasn't a barrier nor a pathway. There was something solid, and he even felt the energy jolt it a little when it touched it!That was why he was entirely sure he had found the thing he was looking for!First, Jacob looked right toward Pig Head, who was invisible in this darkness, but he knew he was there, and every three days, he could hear him moving and drinking his 'tonic.''I don't know if this pig can see me or not… if he can, then he'll do as Decker command him and release that black liquid, and if he doesn't, then… well, I don't know what he will do without Decker's control, but I won't shun this chance of freedom… well, it was still unclear if I will gain freedom or not, so there is no need to burn my brain cells on this….'Without hesitancy, Jacob again made the energy to move in the same path, and this time he felt clear that something was in his glabella, and for some reason, the energy could tremble.However, Jacob suddenly felt a piercing pain in his brain that he wanted to scream, yet he couldn't, but sudden lunacy overcame Jacob's eyes as he used more force and rattled that thing which was in his glabella!Suddenly, Jacob felt his lip moving as the liquid entered his mouth. He quickly closed it since he was still inside the liquid. He had instinctively opened his mouth because of the pain.But he quickly reacted and controlled it. The good news was this thing was losing its control over his body!However, this excited Jacob as he helter-skelter tried to push that thing from its place even more fiercely while completely ignoring the pain. This pain wasn't half as painful as the pain he experienced when he first was awake with his entire torso open, nor was it even close to the pain Bloodstorming Bug caused!Jacob knew this pain was the price of his freedom and he'll pay it no matter the amount!Jacob continued to clash the energy with whatever was on his forehead without even stopping for a moment while continuing to endure maddening pain.He could feel this thing had taken root in his skull just like a parasite plant, and he had had to uproot it!As he was shaking the thing inside his head, he slowly gained control over his limbs.Jacob used his full force and tried to move his hand. He knew this energy wasn't enough to uproot that thing in his head. Now that thing wasn't in complete control of his entire body. He wanted to take this chance to use his hand.With extreme difficulty, his right hand finally moved. It was as if Jacob was possessed by lunacy and didn't care about anything or any consequences. All he wanted was freedom from this hellhole, and he will do anything to gain it!Finally, his head reached his forehead while continuing to tremble.'Just give up!' Jacob's eyes were utterly blood shoot as he stabbed the nails of his thumb and index finger into his glabella with no mercy!Blood got blended into an almost transparent liquid at this moment.Jacob suddenly felt his index finger's nail touch something solid, and he ruthlessly clawed it!This time, Jacob felt his entire brain jolt as that thing finally uprooted from its place!However, Jacob was in a frenzy and didn't let this chance go. With both fingers, he clawed whatever had come off from his skull and pulled it back with a small chunk of his forehead skin!Jacob suddenly felt he had just regained complete control over his body, but he was too tired and fell into slumber without even looking at the thing he was tightly clinching in his fist.The opening on his forehead suddenly healed because of the green liquid. As for the mysterious energy which made all this possible returned to Jacob's heart without his command, it didn't come out of that opening.However, Jacob didn't know about it at all as he fell into a deep slumber in the crimson liquid with a clenched hand and a faint smirk on his lips.As for Pig Head, just as he expected, he didn't notice his movements at all in this darkness and remained standing still.However, after the wound on Jacob's forehead was completely healed, the green liquid completely turned transparent or crimson since Jacob's blood was blended within now.The main point was that Jacob was now in a state of hibernation after finally being free… what a tragedy!

Chapter 13 Awakening
﻿Four months later, after Jacob fell into hibernation,The voice of tiny footsteps could be heard inside a dark silent room. Thereupon, the door that had closed for over eight months made a creaking sound of opening.A surprised yet husky voice sounded at this moment. "What happened to the light pearl? Did it run out of energy?" If Jacob were awake, he would've instantly recognized that husky voice. This was indeed Decker, who had come back after his long trip.A white light suddenly illuminated the small room from the staircase at this moment.Pig Head could be seen standing listlessly right before Jacob's glass cell. He didn't attack Decker because of their connection of master and slave or the moment the door opened. The intruder would've been dead by now if it wasn't Decker himself!Decker slowly descended the stairs. He wore a black cape that was drenched with water, clearly implying that he had just traveled in heavy rainfall.However, Decker's green beastly eyes suddenly went wide when he saw the glass cell filled with crimson color, and Jacob was vaguely visible.His heart sank as he yelled in an infuriated manner, "What the hell happened to him?! Didn't I clearly say if you see any strangeness with him, you just have to release the black liquid quickly?! Are you dead, you pig ear chode?!"Decker viciously kicked Pig Head's leg, which was twice his size, and Pig Head reaming, standing like a tower without any expression of pain or distress.Decker knew he was just egging a stone wall, and he wasn't a Pig Head match at all, which made him even more infuriated."It must be because of that fucking light pearl, fuck, what bad luck!" Decker regained his rationality quickly.He knew Pig Head was just an empty husk, and he couldn't expect him to do something rational of his own free will.Suddenly, Decker's long ears twitched as his expression turned into astonishment and ecstasy."His heart is beating. He's alive!" Decker strode toward Jacob's cell and pushed a bronze button.Thereby, the red liquid started to sink into the bottom.Decker felt immense relief when he saw Jacob's face, which was completely fine, and he started to breathe normally.'Was it some side effect of blood change? It was indeed the right decision to get a Bloodline Scanning Scale. I won't be able to find accurate results without it….' Decker felt quite pleased with himself as he looked at the large bag under his cloak.Before, he was startled by Jacob and forgot about the weight on him. Now that he knew Jacob was fine, he finally relaxed.He saw the red liquid was still only half sank, so he pressed the blue button beside the bronze and moved toward the table to put down the large bag.He barely missed Jacob's clenched left hand, or he would've been overreacting right now.On the other hand, Jacob still didn't know he had just dodged a bullet because of Decker's overconfidence. He finally opened his eyelids after four months!After a momentary confusion, he suddenly remembered what had happened and just happened to see Decker's back. He flinched for a moment before instantly understanding what had happened.'I fell into hibernation!' Jacob quickly saw the sinking red liquid, and he knew he was right.Then he suddenly remembered about the thing he pulled from his forehead before falling into hibernation. He felt inside his left fist a small stone-like object, not some parasite bug he was guessing before.But he moved quickly as he opened his mount, put whatever was in his fist between his teeth, closed his mouth, stood straight like status, and closed his eyes.Jacob knew he only had time while Decker's back was still facing him, so he quickly reacted.He didn't want to clash with this brown devil right now, not while he was still behind glass with unknown sturdiness and that pig freak was still gawking at him.However, his movement was clearly noticed by Pig Head, and since Decker didn't give him a new command, he moved toward the button panel, so he could press the black button since Jacob had just made a strange movement.Luckily for Jacob, Decker clearly caught the movement of Pig Head, and he yelled in perplexity, "YOU! You, empty brain chode, what the hell is wrong with you!? First, you nearly let my precious subject die, and now you're going to waste my precious Rare-Grade healing liquid?! Go back to your fucking cell and activate the blue liquid, useless crap!"Decker cursed Pig Head many times and even kicked him with his little legs to release some of his frustration.Jacob calmly listened to Decker's curses and sneered inside, 'Yes, just caged those Pig Mussels. Without him, I don't believe you can put on with my surprise attack!'Jacob's heartbeat didn't increase this time as he remained static while he felt a new liquid start to fill the glass cell.'I will only get one chance at this, and if I fail, I might as well commit suicide and then fall back into this brown fucker's hands!' Jacob was ready for a do-or-die situation.Since Decker would wait for him to wake up, he knew he had time to make a solid strategy.First, Jacob's attention was drawn to the object in his mouth. He dared to bluntly put it in his mouth because even after months of remaining in his hand, this thing didn't do anything, and it was a solid object, like stone.All he felt was two needles on this object's surface, and he could guess that this thing was probably planted by hands, and it wasn't alive like a parasite, and it probably only worked on the brain or the same spot it was planted in his head, that why it was harmless right now.Jacob soon discovered that this thing was only half a centimeter in size and was very solid and diamond-shaped. Even with his teeth, he couldn't seem to damage it!'This thing can do wonders if I'll use it right!' Jacob's mind was working at lightning speed at this moment.He wasn't just some random old man; he was the freaking tycoon and Emperor of the weapon industry, Jacob Steve, who shocked the world with his wits and discovery or couldn't have reacted so quickly, only within seconds after just waking up!

Chapter 14 Positions Changed
﻿Decker quickly changed into a new green outfit that looked like a grown, and after sorting out all the things he had collected and bought from his eight-month journey, he sat on a wooden chair comfortably.He looked at Jacob's glass cell, which was now filled with light blue liquid just like Pig Head's cell, and a light glint flashed past his eyes.'Should I wait for him to awake, or should I just test him as is it?' Decker mulled over this choice.He picked up the blue wooden cubic box from the table. It was one foot in diameter. He slowly opened it, and inside was a black rectangular device, which was eight inches in size. It had a five inches black display, and round, shining red buttons were on the other three inches of the black area.Right below these four buttons was a tiny needle, which was hollowed from the inside.Decker caressed this device delicately, like it was his woman's bosom, and mused.'Although this Bloodline Scanning Scale is of a Rare-Grade, it still cost me half of my fortune, and I can't even find it easily in this barren place. Whatever, as long as this last experiment succeeds, I will need all the data I want, and then I can leave this damn place. Once I become powerful enough, I will make those arrogant bastards tremble beneath my foot!'Decker's eyes were filled with hysteria as he remembered something unpleasant and repulsive. He couldn't remain calm after that and stood up."Why the hell would I need to wait for my slave?" Decker mumbled as he pressed the bronze button again, and the blue liquid started to sink again.Jacob was utterly awake as he remained static while he felt the blue liquid keep sinking, and he could breathe again. He knew this was his only chance, or Decker might notice something amiss as time passed.Decker was entirely oblivious to Jacob's ambush plan. He blindly believed in his strong hearing ability. He could've easily detected Jacob's fast heart rate, but Jacob had completely controlled his nerves, especially his heart rate, after controlling the mysterious energy for months. Likewise, he deeply benefited from it, unbeknownst to him!After three minutes, the liquid finally sank completely, and Decker pressed something again right beside the glass cell and then finally started to slide down, revealing Jacob's naked, skeletal figure.Decker still didn't notice anything amiss with Jacob. He coolly extended his hand toward Jacob's right hand to grab it.But something entirely out of Decker's wildest imagination happened at this moment when Jacob's eyelids snapped open, revealing his icy amber eyes, and he quickly grabbed Decker's brown hand with a powerful grip!Decker was startled at that moment with this sudden turn of events, and this moment was all Jacob needed to react.Jacob's right hand, which was formed into a scissor-shaped, moved at full speed, and without any delay, his index and middle finger were stabbed into Decker's wild opened eyes!"Ahhhhhhhh….!"Decker shrilled and screamed like a pig when he felt Jacob's bony, sharp fingers in his eyes.Jacob still wasn't done. He released his grip from Decker's wrist, forming a punch, and let loose a sharp husky sound before throwing a punch filled with hatred and resentment toward Decker's pointy chin!Decker felt like he was struck by a sledgehammer and instantly fell to the ground, bleeding from his eye sockets and mouth. Jacob has completely caught him with his pants down, and with the boxing and defensive skills he learned in his past life, he quickly manhandled Decker, who was small and weak without his tricks!However, Jacob still wasn't calm, despite seeing listless Decker on the floor. He knew he wasn't dead and didn't want him dead either.Jacob opened his mouth and spat something in his hand. He could finally see the cause of his suffering. It was a red diamond shape object with two needles on one side and a very tiny black symbol on the other side.Jacob didn't know what it was, nor did he care at this moment. He looked at Decker with a vicious smile on his bony, pale face. He sat on him and, with bare nails, he dug right in the middle of his forehead.Crimson blood gushed out, but Jacob was utterly unfazed. He would never show mercy toward his enemies, and Decker was someone he hated the most. Even in his previous life, he never thought of killing someone this much as he thought of killing Decker!Jacob placed the diamond shape object right where he dug Decker's skin and pressed it with full force and when he felt he was properly stuck on the right spot, he vaguely saw a very tiny black light.'Oh, it's active like this, huh!' Jacob was finally assured.But he still wasn't done!He started to take off Decker's clothes. Decker was plump, as his brown torso was also filled with some battle scars.Jacob's eyes landed on two bracelets in Decker's hand. One had a black ribbon, and a red ruby was embedded in it, which reminded him of that diamond he had just planted into Decker's forehead.'This should be the remote control of that stone!' Jacob quickly took it off and saw a tiny black mark right in the middle of this ruby, the same as the red diamond!Decker wore it on his own wrist, and then his eyes landed on the second bracelet, which had a black band and a dark blue gemstone embedded on this one. But this one looked more exquisite, and there was a small string of tiny symbols in its center.'This should be the controller of that pig muscles!' Jacob took off this bracelet as well and put it on!Lastly, his eyes landed on a black chain and black pendant, which Decker was wearing. The pendant was a pitch-black circle, four-centimeter in diameter. However, when looking at it closely, it was delicately carved in an extremely vivid snake that was eating its own tail forming this circle, and it looked very vivid, as if it was alive.Furthermore, there were marks left inside the interior of this snake circle, which clearly implied that there was a piece missing from this pendant.Jacob instantly felt he had seen this kind of symbol before, but he didn't seem to remember where. Nonetheless, he also pocketed that chain and pendant, and after making sure Decker had nothing left on him, he put him into his own glass cell and released the blue liquid.Jacob never wanted to kill Decker in the first place, not after he got his hands on the slave stone.Jacob wore a stiff smile as he looked at the unconscious Decker in the glass cell. Their positions had changed now.'I'm going to enjoy this!'

Chapter 15 Blood Analysis
﻿After Jacob was finally done handling Decker, he felt immense relief as all the adrenaline rushing through his vines finally started to calm down, and he felt tired.He still couldn't believe that he had managed to thwart a monster and completely turn the tables on him. He slowly walked toward the same chair where Decker was just sitting a couple of moments ago.'Sigh… this feeling for walking again...'Jacob let loose a heavy sigh like an old man as he completely relaxed on Decker's chair and closed his eyes, and for the first time after he reincarnated, he felt alive and free!"Freedom…" Jacob's hoarse voice rang at this moment. This was probably the first word he ever spoke. His voice was powerful for his bony self, as Jacob's old man-like demeanor made it even more imposing.A happy smile suddenly emerged on his pale face. It was a sincere smile of happiness, "I can finally say I got another shot at life, and I'm going to live it to the fullest, just like my old life, and who knows I might be able to live much longer in this mysterious yet magical world!"Jacob's smile widened. He didn't seem like someone who just 'popped' an Imp-Goblin's eyes and beat the crap out of him. He just looked like an ordinary young man filled with grand ambitions.After enjoying the moment for a while, Jacob smiled wryly at his naked self. In his happiness, he almost forgot he was still in his birthday suit.He looked around and clearly saw what was in this small room beside that 'torture table' and his 'old home'.There was a small closet at one of the corners right below the stairway and a shelf on the other corner of the table.Besides these two extra things, there wasn't anything except the new large bag Decker had bought or Decker's old bag. Both of them were lying on the 'torture table' at this moment.Jacob completely ignored everything else and went straight toward the closet and opened it. He would not feel comfortable without any clothing on his body.This closet has only three shelves, and only Decker's size clothes are in it, which won't fit Jacob, who is two heads taller than Decker.In the end, he picked up two black cloaks; he rolled one around his waist and draped one on his shoulder.'Much better.' Jacob felt comfortable after hiding his 'assets' and finally paid attention to those two bracelets he pocketed from Decker.He first looked at the dark blue gem bracelet. He didn't know how to use it or how to make himself its owner, but he never saw Decker using them openly since he always commanded him literally.Jacob tried to imitate Decker and speak closer to the dark blue gem bracelet, "Pig Head, come out!"He looked toward Pig Head's cell with anticipation, but nothing happened.Jacob's brows frowned a little and mused, 'Could it be I need my blood to form some kind of connection with these gems?'He picked up a knife-like tool from the steel tray and perked his finger, and his blood dropped on the dark blue gem, and it instantly absorbed it!Jacob's eyes flash as he quickly drops his blood on the red one, and it also quickly absorbs it.Although he didn't feel anything, by those two gemstone reactions, he knew his theory was successful!"Pig Head, move your head!" This time, there was boundless confidence in Jacob's heavy voice.Pig Head really moved his head after receiving Jacob's command!'Heh, at least those books have some use.' Jacob was quite satisfied with this development. 'Let's see how you escape my grasp now, little fucker!'A cold glint flashed in Jacob's eyes as he gazed at Decker's cell before he averted his gaze. His eyes landed on the device Decker was carrying when he opened his cell and picked it up from the floor.'It just looked like a smartphone. Could this world be as advanced as mine or even more?' Jacob's thoughts wandered for a moment, but he shook his head and smirked, 'I'm not even outside, and I'm already thinking like this, heh, you're just as greedy as always, eh, Jacob.'A light chuckle escaped Jacob's mouth before he pressed the buttons on the device and tried to activate it. He mused that since Decker had bought it, and it was in such fancy packing, it must be pretty expensive and essential to him.However, nothing happened, no matter which button he pressed or how long he pressed."Is it broken?" Jacob murmured to himself, and his eyes finally landed on the small needle at the bottom of those buttons.Jacob remembered Decker coming for his hand at that time. 'Did it need my blood to activate?'Jacob was fascinated and pressed his thumb on the small needle, which instantly pierced through his skin, making it even more evident that it was made for this purpose.Just as Jacob's blood entered the needle, the black screen lit up in white, and an unfamiliar yet familiar black character appeared.'Numbers? Oh, I can read this language? Is it because of this body's previous owner I can read and understand this world's language?' Jacob was quite sure about this.The countdown on the black screen finally ended after nine seconds. New words appeared, which made Jacob intrigued."The blood analysis has been completed. Please press the button to check the result!"Oh, is this thing like some measuring device?"Jacob quickly pressed the first button, and the screen changed again."Specie: Human,"Sex: Male,"Age: 23,"Strength: Too Weak,He pressed the second button without delay, as he expected this much after from his bony body."Bloodline: Not Pure (Fusion)"Human Bloodline (Uncommon-Tier): 70%"Rat Hound (Rare-Tier): 5%"Unknown Bloodline: 20%"(Note: Please Purchase a higher grade device to discover about this bloodline and more information!)"Unknown Bloodline: 5%"(Note: Please Purchase a higher grade device to discover about this bloodline and more information!)"I have two unknown bloodlines in my body, and this device is too low grade to identify them, which means this 'Rare-Tier' bloodline is this device's limit. But what the fuck is this Rat Hound? Just what kind of shit this little shit was doing with this body all this time!"Jacob couldn't help but curse Decker before pressing the third button!

Chapter 16 Blood Lifespan
﻿Jacob knew he had to now live with all those experiments Decker had done on him, and they can't be undone just like that, so he had no choice but to accept the reality.He pressed the third button to see just what kind of information this would reveal,"Blood Analysis Report:"Because of four different tier bloodline fusions within human species 'Uncommon-Physique and Uncommon Bloodline,' this fusion is exceptionally harmful and deadly for the user."Please extract other bloodlines as soon as possible."(Note: Please Purchase a higher grade devise for more accurate blood analysis results and more information!)"The heck?! Is this company selling products or advertising them by selling them?" Jacob cursed and berated the company behind this device harshly.But he couldn't help but feel worried when he saw the Bloodline Analysis Report. Even without this device, he knew this kind of blood change couldn't be done as Decker did, and his being alive was a miracle on its own.Jacob knew he was fucked and hated Decker even more, when he glanced at the glass cell filled with a blue liquid with a hint of Decker's blood."Sigh… let's see what the last button can tell me." Jacob helplessly shook his head like an old man.A new display emerged,"Blood Lifespan:"User has approximately less than 2000 Days of life because of user blood fusion."(Warning: This result is not entirely accurate and only depends on the blood analysis.)"(Note: Please purchase a higher grade device for more accurate blood lifespan results and more accurate information!)"What, less than 2000 days!?" Jacob's eyes dilated when he saw this line and panicked.There wasn't anything scarier than death for him out there, and definitely not after he was reincarnated and finally became free! "No, this shity device is clearly flawed since they put such advertisements in every fucking report!" Jacob muttered to himself. He just didn't want to believe it, even though deep down he knew Decker's experiments were enough to gain such results.Jacob threw the Blood Analysis Device on the table and just remained motionless on his chair while his eyes closed.'What a stroke of damn bald luck, heh. I got this new life in this new mysterious world. But I already knew I'd die in less than seven years just because of a freaking little monster. Hah, truly lamentable,' Jacob thought while bemoaning his bad luck.After he calmed down, he quickly accepted the fact about his lifespan because he wasn't someone who lived in delusions.'Well, since this device had said to extract the types of the blood of other species can undo all this, then it might be possible to salivate my situation. Or I can always find another human and change his blood with my own. It's not like I didn't experience it already!'Jacob's amber eyes snapped open as a vicious glint flashed past them before he regained his calm demeanor.'thum… thum…'Suddenly, a light sound of something knocking against a hard surface drew Jacob's attention, and when he looked at the source, he pulled an extremely frosty smile, 'He's awake. These strange liquids really do wonders!'Decker was currently wiggling his limbs inside the glass cell while his mouth was opening and closing. He clearly was still shocked by what had happened to him.Although Decker was completely fine, his two eyes were now just black sockets. Before, Jacob didn't hold back with his surprise attack and ruthlessly destroyed Decker's eyes.Eyes were the weakest spot of any living being, and Jacob didn't know Decker was just bark and no bite. That's why he went for his eyes and was so ruthless with his attacks. Nonetheless, he didn't regret even a little what he did!Jacob finally stood up and coolly moved toward Decker's cell with a wintry smile on his face. "Look what we have here, a blind little shit, huh? Say still and close your mouth!"Decker suddenly trembled when he heard this deep voice filled with mockery and viciousness. All his movement suddenly stopped after this heavy voice faded.'The Parasite Gem!' Decker instantly knew he had been enslaved, and his heartbeat shot up tremendously!He finally remembered how he ended up like this, and an extremely weak figure flashed past his mind, 'How did that human manage to extract the Parasite Gem without dying?!'His head was filled with these questions, but alas, he couldn't speak right now since he was now on Jacob's mercy, just like when Jacob was. Their positions have been swapped and changed!Jacob was quite pleased with Decker's reaction, as he also pushed the bronze button on the button panel on the wall, just like Decker."Pig Head, come out!" Jacob also commanded Pig Head.He won't be taking any risk with Decker since he knows nothing about what Decker is or what kind of things he is capable of, and Pig Head is his strongest trump card.Because he didn't have free will, like Jacob and Decker, he was sure of it because Pig Head's eyes were always listless, with no luster of life whatsoever, which means he was dead or something like a death state. Or someone like Decker can never control such a monster!Pig Head's eyes snapped open as he pressed something inside his glass cell, and the liquid started to sink.'So, his glass cell had an inner control panel, which means Decker wasn't afraid he would turn against him. Moreover, he can easily awake from his sleeping slate. Was it the liquid or something else?' Jacob mused.Jacob didn't dwell on this topic for now since Decker's cell was finally emptied, and he was eager to give Decker a taste of his own medicine!He opened Decker's cell and calmly sat on the chair again while looking at expressionless blind Decker, who was standing there like a little puppet.Pig Head also came out of his cell at this moment.Jacob's lips curled as he said coldly, "I don't like the way you're standing, Slave, so… KNEEL!"

Chapter 17 A Confession (1)
 ﻿"KNEEL!"Decker fell to his knees with no hesitation after hearing Jacob's powerful command."See, it wasn't so hard to kneel, right?" Jacob said in his heavy voice with a hint of mockery.'Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold!' Jacob's eyes flashed.Decker had an expressionless face, and he didn't even have eyes to see Jacob's gloating expression at this moment. All he could do was just hear Jacob's mocking voice, which pierced his heart in millions of ways.'I could escape pursued by an army of experts, but in the end, I fell into the hands of my own slave, heh, truly retribution…' Decker silently lamented at this moment.He was a very careful person because you had to be very careful if you wanted to survive out there with no existing strength, and Decker was such a case. He didn't have anything except his knowledge and the life-saving tricks he had learned from deadly experiences.But in the end, he was played by his own slave, and the slave was a weak human, nevertheless. Although he didn't know how Jacob got free from the Parasite Gem, he knew after what he had done with Jacob. His death won't be pretty!Furthermore, his eyes were now gone, and he knew they couldn't be regenerated, not here at least, and without his eyes, he was nothing but a blind old goblin who anyone could squish like a bug. That's why he stopped resisting and waited for his death.Jacob said again at this moment, "You can speak freely."Although he wanted nothing more than to kill Decker in the cruelest way possible, he wanted the most information about this world from Decker!Foremost, he knew nothing about where he was or what kind of place this was. He had already seen Decker's drenched cloak, but he had never heard a rain sound in this place before, which meant they were deep underground, and Decker must've left many traps outside for intruders. That's why he didn't dare to leave this place on his own.Secondly, Decker was clearly hiding from someone here. He could tell just by how rigorously Decker behaved when he left last time.Third, Decker seemed quite resourceful since it could acquire this kind of equipment and set it up in this hellhole. Those two glass cells and liquids were high-tech enough to leave Jacob speechless and to wonder.Lastly, Decker was a wily fox who had extraordinary life experiences, and he might know all kinds of places and secrets, and Jacob was very interested in them.As a wily old fox, he knew the information would be his biggest weapon if he wanted to survive in his world filled with monsters like Decker.Decker's lips finally opened as he spoke at this moment, "If you want information from me, then boy, let me tell you this: I would rather die than give my knowledge to a human slave! This parasite gem might be able to control me physically, but it can't control my free will!"'So that diamond was called Parasite Gem, a fitting name indeed.' Jacob nodded his head in understanding.Jacob coolly spoke at this moment as he expected it, "Hoho, wolves may lose their teeth but not their nature. It's quite fitting on you."Decker was suddenly intrigued by this strange phrase that he had never heard before.Jacob's bitter voice rang again. "You're indeed correct. I need information. But you're incorrect about something, and that is: I'm not requesting."Decker sneered at this moment, "Do, your worse human slave. I'm not like you humans who can be broken by pain!"Jacob merely smiled and said, "Then let me ask you, even if Parasite Gem can't control your free will, it can still control your body completely, right?""So, what if it can control my body? What can you do worse, inflict some pain, or cut my limbs bit by bit? Or put some bug in my body? Or maybe even rape me? You have no idea how much suffering I had to endure to get to this point. You're just one of those lucky bastards, nothing special!" Decker chucked coldly, showing no fear whatsoever.Jacob's eyes finally narrowed. He could tell Decker was a complete madman who feared nothing and was always ready for death. This kind of person was something he hated the most because they were too hard to deal with.Furthermore, this little devil was not even human, and Jacob knew nothing about his kind or weakness, which put him in a disadvantageous position."Fine, since you don't fear pain, what about a quick death?" Jacob tried another approach."Quick Death, huh? Thanks, but no thanks, I will not reveal anything to you even if you promise this entire world!" Decker remained stubborn.Jacob's expression turned frosty this time. He blurted, "You know, all my life, I never killed anyone, nor did I torture anyone. You know why?"Decker sneered mockingly. "Because you're a pussy, and in the end, you become my slave. Hahaha… such is the fate of the weak and ignorant!" his voice was filled with self-mockery and bitterness toward the end.Jacob didn't mind Decker's ridicule since he had no idea how this body ended up in this kind of situation, and said, "Now shut up and listen,"I never kill because it's not like I can't or didn't want to… but I was afraid… afraid that if I start, I won't be able to stop. That I will enjoy it and become addicted to it."It all started when I saw my mother getting shot right into her left eye by a stray bullet from a gang fight when I was right in her embrace. I was only ten at that time, but I will never forget that scene and the feeling when I was covered in her warm blood, and I was confused and didn't know what had happened. I just keep calling out for her while desperately crying…"Afterward, I know I was never the same. I was so angry that I wanted to burn the entire world and let all the living beings feel my pain, which I can't describe…

Chapter 18 A Confession (2)
﻿"I was always so angry that I just wanted to kill everyone, and the people I hated the most were not those gangs who were fighting, but my father, whom I never come into contact with until later and blamed my mother's death on him."Because if he were there, my mother wouldn't have to work so late, and she would never have always come and get me from my grandparents' house."Despite that, I never get myself to see through my desire because I knew deep down if I ever started, I could never hold myself back, and I always have my grandparents watching over me."Yet, I always had this demon deeply hidden within me, so, to keep it in check, I put my attention elsewhere, and ironically, I chose the same business which caused my mother's death: Weaponry!"I didn't know why, but I got a strange satisfaction whenever I researched those weapons of mass destruction. It put me at ease, or I could say it keeps that demon in check."The people who died because of me were many, and despite knowing this, I still didn't stop because I couldn't stop."Even though I never killed them myself, I designed and created the tools that can kill anyone and anywhere. I created them so meticulously that when they use for the kill, the target will never have a chance to escape alive."I even developed a new weapon and released it to the world, and I even became a tycoon because of it. Because of it, people called me a genius researcher, not a killer."However, that wasn't the only technology I developed. There were ten, even more, terrifying weapons I designed, but I never made them public or even told anyone about them because I knew if any one of those weapon blueprints saw the light of the day, then it might really burn the entire world down, and I don't want it since I would turn into ashes as well. "However, I could never stop myself from continuing to walk on this path because this will give me the most incredible pleasure. This is how I could live like an average person. I even had a happy family."But you know what, I was never able to throw that thought of how it would have felt to kill myself out of my mind. Not until I was close to my death."In the last years of my life, I found I crave my life far more than that bloodlust or anything else, as a matter of fact, and finally overcome that demon which was with me for my entire life and my bloodlust."However, what I could never conquer was death. Even if I slow it down, it still comes and gets me. This finally made me understand that life was far more precious than I thought, and I even felt remorse about what I had done in my entire life. I feel genuine despair, a terror which only a dying person would understand."Regardless, somehow, after I awake here, and you put me through all those suffering that I never imagined before, I found out that the demon within me was still there. It never left or was eliminated. I unknowingly hold control of it, and you help me understand it!"Jacob's face was exempt from any emotion as he confessed he had been carrying for all his life. He never thought he would tell anyone about it and he'll carry it to his grave, and he did.But after encountering Decker, he felt like telling him all this because Decker was someone he got to talk with after a very long time. In all those years living with the help of those machines, he could never speak or think straight.Someone seldom visited him, and even if someone were talking to him, he would hardly understand the words because of the condition which he put himself into.But after taking over this body, he felt alive again, but Decker still taught him that this world was full of ruthless people and monsters like him, and it was far more dangerous than his previous world, and he had to be ruthless if he wanted to survive here.Nevertheless, he still hated Decker since he put him through all that pain and despair, and now he was even refusing to talk."Do you know why I was telling you all this?" Jacob impassively said, "You may speak freely." He didn't want Decker to interrupt him, so he made him shut up before.Decker suddenly started laughing crazily, "Hahaha… It seemed like your brain was thoroughly damaged because of all those experiments. Your delusions really know no bounds. Hahaha…"How could he not laugh?Jacob was talking about his previous life and reincarnation. Decker didn't understand any of it since it all seemed like a fantasy story to him and a lunatic's imagination, so he would naturally not believe it, even if you beat him to death.The concept of reincarnation just does not fit well with someone like Decker.Jacob remained expressionless and said, "Maybe you're right or maybe not… but don't you understand the hidden meaning behind my story? Or are you just an intelligent idiot?""Heh, you're just a maniacal human, so stop talking about intelligence with me!" Decker sneered.Jacob didn't mind and continued, "It's simple. Actually, it's like this when you're in a desperate situation or desperate for something your mind will never stop thinking about its solution and even find started to create different ways to solve it or get the thing you wanted."You'll even imagine robbing that thing you want or magically solving your situation with almost impossible facts in play."However, when you accept that the situation is hopeless or you can't get what you want, your mind will never think about these solutions."But this will also put a hold on your thinking, and you'll just limit yourself as you keep doing the same again and again until you simply stop thinking creatively and cage yourself in a mental cage you create for yourself."You see, your situation is like the latter scenario. Since you accept your death, you'll never budge or at least think this way."However, I'm the former kind because I desperately want that information, and I will keep trying and thinking all the possible ways to obtain it, and this helps me think out of the box, which is what we call imagination…."

Chapter 19 Clues About New World
﻿"However, I'm the former kind because I desperately want that information, and I will keep trying and thinking of all the potential ways to obtain it, and this helps me think out of the box, which is what we call imagination."And this is also the reason you lose to me. I never lost hope, even when I felt like death was the right and easy end to my suffering. I just never stop thinking and grab any straw that can help me float in that despair, and now I'm sitting here without a parasite gem while you're kneeling just like me at the same spot with a parasite gem."Jacob's words were like invisible blades that cut deeper into Decker's heart and mind. Even though he didn't want to admit it, Jacob was telling the truth. He had already given up resisting and accepted his unprecedented death.But he still didn't admit it because he still looked down on Jacob, partly because he was a human and partly because he was his former slave. He would still rather die than admit anything to Jacob.He just didn't want to give him the satisfaction he wanted!"Human Slave, your words are nothing but empty, and you are a lunatic, so you still will get nothing from me! You said you were afraid of killing others just because you'll get addicted to it? Don't let me laugh. Nobody can resist such a temptation their entire life, much less someone like you who is still wet behind his ears!"You're saying you create weapons that will never miss their targets, huh? Well, your imagination is admirable but let me break it to you, do you hear of Giant Race? Not even weapons created by the dwarf race can penetrate through their skin, much less this nonsense you're spouting!"Decker finally retorted with an angry tone.But Jacob's expression couldn't help but change into astonishment when he heard 'Giant Race and Dwarf Race'. He still didn't know what kind of race Decker belonged to, but he never thought there were mythical races like giants and dwarfs that would exist in this world.'This world probably had magic as well!'Jacob's heart couldn't help but race slightly when he thought about magic because he still could feel that strand of energy inside him and after hearing Decker's words, he was more assured that magic existed in this world.However, Decker took Jacob's fast heartbeat in the wrong way and disdainfully scoffed, "What afraid, now? You humans merely live in the Uncommon Races Region with all those uncommon rank races, so you naturally didn't have any idea about the terror of races from the Rare Races Region."So, shut your fucking bullshit and snap out of your horny delusions where you can fuck whoever you want and stop your Fuck-Shit about imagination. There's nothing but the strength that can give you the right even to fantasize!"Jacob finally returns to his calm self as he listens to Decker's disdainful words, which reveal even more about this world and the status of a human here.'So, humans are considered an uncommon race, huh…' Jacob couldn't help but felt pity for humanity since he was also a human in both his previous and new life!Jacob asked again, "So, why don't you just tell me everything I want to know, and I might let you go? What do you think?"After Decker's brief outburst, he now wanted to acquire more information about this world.Decker also calmed down after he castigated Jacob and said stubbornly, "Go fuck yourself!"Jacob merely shook his head in disappointment and said, "Since I can't control your free will, so be it. But don't forget, I can control your body.""Heh, do your worse, Slave." Decker merely sneered as he revealed a mocking smile, shocking his beastly teeth.Jacob suddenly chucked before saying, "You say you need power even to imagine, right? But let me make it absolutely clear you're nothing but someone who has been suppressed all his life by others, and now you only see this world in two colors, Black and White, Right or Wrong, Life and Death…"Your mind has become accustomed to being suppressed after your entire miserable shity little life. I can easily see through you, just by the depression you showed while experimenting on me, and the way you're living out of nowhere with no friends or family is proof of your pathetic life history and narrow viewpoint."Decker's expression twisted in shock and then hatred after Jacob's taunt.Jacob merely sneered coldly and said, "What? Did I hit a nerve? Did the little guy finally remember being trampled under others' feet so often that you can still feel the pressure of their foot and taste the dirt under their foot? Tell me, O magnificent little shit?!"Decker almost spat fire from his mouth because what Jacob said was very close to the actual truth, and he hated nothing but this period of his life and finally couldn't take it anymore of Jacob's insults."You fucking chode….""Shut up!" Jacob snorted before Decker could utter another word. "I have enough of your shits. Let me show you there's always a third way."Decker had again become completely expressionless after Jacob made him shut his mouth. "Since your eyes are gone, I have you use the power of imagination to get what I want, and this will also prove that you can also imagine, despite being my little slave." Said Jacob coldly, with a calm expression.Although he knew this was going to be troublesome, he really had a way to get what he wanted, and if even it didn't work, then he'll just have to put Decker's words about not being afraid of torture or pain through a savage test.Jacob knew very well that if you do not experience it yourself, you'll never know the fear of approaching death. In his youth, he wasn't afraid of dying, just like any other hot-blooded youth, and only when the time really came did he find out just how much he feared not being able to live!

Chapter 20 This Is Bad!
﻿"Let's test a slave's imagination, shall we?" Jacob's cold voice sounded in Decker's ears, which were utterly expressionless right now.Jacob said, "I already told you, you're kneeling in the same position as once I was, so you could immediately picture it intuitively since you once had eyes, and you're more familiar with this place than anyone inside this room."Jacob's eyes flashed as he said, "Point your right-hand index finger toward the Pig-Head glass cell!" Decker's right hand suddenly raised straight, and his index finger started to point toward Pig Head's glass cell, and when it stopped, it was only two centimeters off the mark."Adjust it two centimeters left, and you'll be pointing at the right in the center of the glass cell." Jacob coolly commanded, and Decker did just that."See, now you know exactly where you're kneeling without even having your eyes. Not bad for a salve imagination, I might say." Jacob coldly sneered.Decker, on the other hand, had very different thoughts right now. 'This bastard human is more cunning than I imagine. He even found the trick to use the Rare-Grade Parasite Gem!'Decker felt a chill run down his spine because he clearly knew the Parasite Gem could only control the physique, not the brain, but it was still not to be underestimated because even without a brain, the body was still capable enough to talk.As long as the other party knew what to ask and how to ask, they could easily control the celebration, and Jacob was doing just that right now.Jacob quickly saw thought this advantage to Parasite Gem, although the victim still had their free will and celebration. It was still not that simple because the body could quickly reveal what you're thinking as long as your brain thinks about it.You can't just turn off your brain, nor can you get control over it because it is just too impossible.Decker was trying his best not to think about what Jacob wanted, but no matter what, for a microsecond, his brain would instantly think of what Jacob will ask, and this window was enough for Jacob as long as he asked the right question.Even if Decker controlled his brain and instantly removed the information, Jacob wanted to know he couldn't beat his brain to it!Jacob again asked, "Are we underground right now? If yes, then move your hand right. If no, then move it to the left."Decker's hand quickly moved to the right!"I thought so. Are there any traps? Move your hand in the same pattern for yes and no." Jacob asked. He wanted to make sure about this point as well.Decker's hand again moved to the right, which meant there were traps outside.Jacob only sighed and asked, "See, this wasn't too hard, right? Now let's see, I clearly remembered the last time I heard an extremely familiar sound, a sound of a book being closed, followed by a strange sound when you thought I was still unconscious after the blood-changing process, but I wasn't. Can I get the information I want from that book?"Decker's heart couldn't help but tremble when he heard Jacob's words, and he desperately tried to think about something else, but alas, he had already thought about that book, and his hand moved to the right in affirmation!'This is bad!' Decker couldn't help but think grimly!Jacob instantly followed with another question without giving Decker any chance to ruin this opportunity. "Is this book inside this room? If it is, point your finger in that direction, and lower your hand if it's in your bag!"Decker's finger trembled slightly as if he was fighting for control of his body as blood started to trickle from his nose, but Jacob didn't try to stop Decker. He already got his answer from Decker's desperate action and the slightest movement of his finger toward the right side!Before he wasn't sure if his guess about this book was correct or not, but now he was absolutely sure that book was inside this room and hidden somewhere, he just had to find it now!But Jacob was shocked when he saw Decker's finger jammed in one place while trembling as blood was trickling down from his nose and eyes. He couldn't help but marvel at Decker's willpower.He had experienced just how powerful this Parasite Gem control was. Even he could only do something like Decker with the help of that mysterious strand of energy, but Decker was doing it without it!"Stop!"Jacob knew if he didn't stop Decker's struggle, he might die, and Jacob didn't want that for now. But it also made it more apparent that Decker was really ready to die and wasn't afraid of pain or torture!However, Jacob still underestimated Decker's lunacy. He continued to try to move his body without any sign of stopping. He clearly intended to kill himself!Jacob quickly said, "Pig-Head, knock him cold!"Pig Head, who was listlessly standing behind Jacob, finally moved and quickly slapped Decker unconscious while shattering his teeth!Jacob was speechless with the Pig-Head method, but he knew he couldn't expect anything from this muscle head Pig, so he could only sigh helplessly and said, "Just throw him inside the glass cell and release that blue liquid."Pig Head instantly complied.Jacob stood up from his chair with a heavy expression on his bony face. He never thought his first interaction with Decker would cause such a result. He again reevaluated his view of this world and Decker.Nevertheless, he still got what he wanted though. Even though it was only written information, not Decker's entire knowledge, it was still enough for Jacob to start somewhere.He started knocking around the room walls to find any hidden compartment, as he was familiar with this kind of compartment. He had many of them all over the world in his past life.After knocking around for some time, he breathed heavily since his health wasn't his strong aspect right now, but he still didn't stop looking.He finally knocked on the staircase, and when he was knocking below the staircase, the sound of something hollow rang in the room!
