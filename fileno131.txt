Chapter 131 Infamous In Uncommon Region
﻿The Earthen Kingdom,The prime minister was looking at the capped A-10000, who was holding some papers in his hands with uncertainty. He didn't know why A-10000 had the already marching troops retreat just because of a measly A-rank mercenary appearance among humans.He was also confused about the disappearance of A-9999, but he didn't dare to poke his nose into these scary existences matters.At this moment, A-10000 placed the reports on the table and said coldly, "Are you positive this person is a human, and not a high-ranking member of three hegemonies?"After he encountered Jacob, A-10000 was feeling extremely apprehensive since A-9999 left him alone here to watch over the cannibal plan.When he acquired reports that an A-rank human had appeared out of the blue, without even a second thought, he had the earthen kingdom retrieve their armies and found everything and anything on this variable.He didn't want to experience another incident like Jacob, and he even thought this human was that Faceless Ancient who was playing with them.But these reports were all telling another story.The Prime Minister replied, "From our spies, it's completely confirmed that this person is a hidden ascetic, and he registered over the years ago as a C-rank mercenary in a small town, and he's also an advance-apprentice gunsmith."Although he looked young, my guess is, he might've stumbled upon some opportunity in the Rainy Mountain Ranges, and that's how he managed to become A-rank. Probably some potion or other medicine."Now that he's an A-rank, he decided to show himself, and it's quite clear that he doesn't know about our existence, or he won't dare to be so reckless. He might've already considered himself the king of the uncommon region now, and humans' morals will soar because of it."He sneered in disdain when he thought about how this brat showed off his power and acted like a tyrant. Furthermore, he even wanted to personally go there to teach him a lesson. But alas, A-10000 was acting with too much caution.A-10000 had already seen these details in the reports, but he was still feeling somewhat doubtful, "What if he's that protector you encountered that day and pretending to be human to lure us out?"The Prime Minister replied with uncertainty, "There is a possibility that it's him since the Lionheart City is close to the old lab's location, but we can't find out for sure without probing his strength."He had already thought of this possibility, but he felt this wasn't the guy since that person was much calmer and didn't strike him as a type who would reveal his whereabouts like this and act like a debaucher tyrant.The possibility was there nevertheless, and they couldn't ignore it."Nah, he's pure human." A snickering voice rang at this moment, which startled both of them. "You're finally back!" A-10000 called out with a thrill in his voice. He never thought he would be so glad to see this crazy woman, A-9999."Tsk, I don't want to, but I had to." A-9999 annoyingly replied.A-10000 was still glad as he quickly asked, "So, you check this Silver Tyrant fellow?"A-9999 seriously replied this time, "Indeed. The moment I heard the rumors, I went to that area and investigated thoroughly, and he's a human. I could have crushed him, but I'm afraid he might have some connection with three hegemonies, so I'll leave him to a native."The Prime Minister quickly bowed. "I'll deal with him. Don't worry, my lady.""No, let him enjoy his short live glory for a while." A-9999 chuckled darkly before she continued, "How many cannibals can you make with already accumulated human blood?"A-10000 blurted with anticipation, "So, he left?!"He didn't dare to go out until that Faceless Ancient was still in the uncommon region; he was afraid that fellow would hold a grudge and hunt him down when A-9999 won't be around to protect him.A-9999 sneered disdainfully, "Look at your cowardliness. He's indeed not in the Humane Kingdom, but I'm going to scan the entire place just in case he's still hiding here. In five or six months, our reinforcement would be here, then we don't need to worry about him. But this doesn't mean we can show our faces as we please. Now let him answer my question."This conversation baffled the Prime Minister since he didn't know what they were talking about.Nonetheless, he quickly answered A-9999's question, "With the blood, we already collected, it's enough to create over 100 cannibals same as the first one's level and many low-level ones. My Lady, do you want me to start?"A-9999 thought for a moment, "Start it and then released those cannibals to grow and multiply between goblins and cut off every news about this. Let humans live in delusion for now."We'll secretly create a farm of cannibals. You, trolls will be a mist to cover this farm. I'm going to personally oversee the further research on cannibal."The Prime Minister's eyes lit up and quickly agreed, "I understand. We'll start working post hastily. But what if humans decided to attack us? Now that an A-rank appeared among them, they will be bolder and unafraid!""Heh, they'll be delivering the blood themselves, then. No, this is perfect!" A-9999 eyes shimmered with ghastly light, "I heard these humans can quickly adapt to changes, right? Since an A-rank appeared amidst them, more will follow in his footsteps. It means we'll get more high-level blood!"I want those humans to start another war in confident, but we'll be manipulating behind them while letting them think they are the ones in control and getting an endless supply of human blood!"---The Lionheart City, lion street, the Tyrant Mansion.Yes, the mansion where Jacob lives is now known as the Tyrant Mansion by everyone.The tyrant mansion had gone through some changes in the past three days.One could see many small bunkers in the vast garden of the tyrant mansion, while the backyard was now completely covered in a doom-like shade and blocked everyone's vision.The only way in was either from the mansion or by creating a hole in the shade which no one would dare.Furthermore, in these past three days, many high-ranking officers of the Lionheart City came to pay a visit, but they were rejected at the main gate.Among these rejected officers, the city lord, the mercenary branch's leader, the vice leader, the gunsmith guild leader, and even the beautiful apothecary guild leader rejected with many other nobles.However, no one dared to show any displeasure, and they politely left after leaving some greeting gifts. Even Samuel's heart was crushed by Silver Tyrant, and Alice was turned into a slave. They didn't want to antagonize such a person unless they wanted an ending like those two famous figures.The Gunsmith Guild Leader Drew was feeling the most complicated among everyone because he had spent some time with Jacob, and he benefited the most from him when he let him take the credit for Magnum.Now that he thought about how he once wanted to protect Jacob, he laughed in self-mockery and even felt fear when he thought about how Jacob had killed Samuel.As for the Vice Guild Leader, Olaf, who schemed against Jacob, he had long vanished from the lionheart city the very night news about Jacob being an A-rank expert surfaced.Lastly, the Star Mercenary Agency's leader had already found out about Jacob's registration with them. He was thrilled and wanted to approach Jacob and form a connection, but was rejected mercilessly.The last person who was effective by Jacob's identity as an A rank was none other than Rose of the Lionheart family.When she thought about how she tried to be bold with Jacob and even wanted to use him as a meat shield, she nearly had a mental breakdown. Right now, she was hiding, while in constant fear Jacob would come one day and make her his slave. Her father still didn't know about me,t or he would have a heart attack.As for the man who was the eye of the storm, the Silver Tyrant, Jacob did not know about what was happening because of him in an entire uncommon region. Even if he'd known, he would've merely scoffed since he had already anticipated this.Right now, he was currently sitting on a stone platform in the middle of the newly built pool and just crossed the threshold of 20-G force, and the oxygen in the water again got absorbed in his body's pores.He now felt it even more clearly than before, and all of a sudden Jacob felt a strange sensation that was still hard to describe, and not only that, but his heartbeat started to rise as more oxygen entered his body.'So, it can indeed raise my heartbeat without me using some excessive method.' Jacob solemnly thought, 'But I never expected it would be this effective. As if this Water Meditation was created to practice fluid acceleration. Immortika also told me at that time that I would find a way very soon…'

Chapter 132 Can You Prove It?
﻿'… Immortika also told me I would find a way very soon…'Jacob connected the dots as he felt like Immortika probably knew about the Art of Nature's true effects, but it didn't bother to say anything, nor did it comment on it when Jacob inquired about it.Nevertheless, this also strengthens his belief that he should keep practicing this technique and not slack off.As his heartbeat increased with more and more oxygen entering his body, Jacob was fully focused on his heart rate and didn't dare to miss a single heartbeat.After over ten minutes, Jacob's heartbeat was at four BPS when he felt the sensation suddenly staggered while the gravity also vanished.Jacob's eyes snapped open and frowned, 'Even over million-gallon water can only sustain water mediation over 2HH:10MM? What about the 24-hour limit?! Didn't I need to enter a vast river at that time?'His expression was grave as the liquid suddenly started to turn vapors again.'Although, with my current capacity, I might hold on for over two and half hours, but I required over 300-meter-deep bore, and the aquifer is over a mile deep, according to Harrison.'A mile-deep bore should be enough to cross a three hours mark, but it would also put me in danger since the gravity would be 30-G at that time, and this stone pillar might not be able to spot me and brake. Well, I let them reinforce this pillar with metal, but I required more labor for it if I want it to be done quickly.'Jacob looked toward the round platform he was sitting on, which was only deep enough to cover his head with water. But actually, it was a pillar connected to the bottom, which was formed by digging around it.Jacob had given the command, and those mercenaries didn't dare to make any mistakes.But it turns out, even this hundred-meter pool wasn't enough.Jacob suddenly thought about the raging border river between the uncommon and rare regions, and he knew that was the perfect place for practicing water meditation.But he won't have this pillar in that river, and he might really drown within that river's depth. So, until he was absolutely sure of his ability to swim under that pressure, he won't try it no matter what.Instead, this method was far safer as long as he could reinforce this pillar and have those mercenaries dig just half of the surface from now on, just enough for more water to fill it.While the other half can be easily reinforced with iron, he won't have to worry about this pillar's breaking at that time.But he required some laborers and forgers to start the reinforcing process, and if possible, he wanted to fill the half pool with iron to create a solid iron platform. At that time, he just let them dig as deep as he wanted.As for finding people who were up for the task, Jacob knows where to find them, and he was the most powerful person in the Humane Kingdom, so no one would dare to reject him.Jacob finally stood up and looked at the gorgeous woman in maid attire which revealed her voluptuous figure, holding a towel in her hand with a bewitching look on her face as saw the water dispersing at an alarming rate in astonishment.Jacob paid little attention to her attractiveness and jumped toward her and landed on the poolside, snapping Alice from her stupor.She instantly looked down when she saw bare-chest Jacob walking over her with a tingle of red on her pale white face. She didn't dare to look him in eyes anymore.Since Jacob had turned her into a slave as a war trophy, she thought Jacob was after her body like others and would rape her and torment her by any means possible because of the tyrannical image he displayed that day.She simply could not resist and didn't want to die either after reaching this point. So, she thought it in another direction. If Jacob was attracted to her and if she could seduce him, who would dare to mess with her?Jacob differed completely from Samuel, she acted normally around Samuel since he wanted to play a gentleman to win over her heart and he was also aware of her talent and required her help once she entered the B-rank so he didn't dare to force himself on her.However, Jacob didn't seem to care about her beauty status or talent, and by his looks, he was probably younger than her as well.That's why she had to use another approach with him, so she decided to willingly become his slave and do anything he wanted her, even warm his bed and slowly earn his goodwill.Although this situation looked disadvantageous and disgusting, for her, it was a tremendous opportunity to exchange her body for the most powerful man in this kingdom.Not just her, but all those ladies were sure that Jacob was a debauched man like others because he has every woman living 'with him' and wore maid clothes.But everyone was surprised because they didn't even see Jacob's shadow, much less summon them or come into their quarters.Even Alice, who had complete confidence in her looks and was ready to spring into action that night, was never called, which made her uneasy.As for approaching his room on their own, they didn't have the guts to even look at him, much less barge into his room without his order.Only today, Jacob emerged when Harrison reported the news of pool completion, and he didn't summon Alice here either.But she took the initiative to come here and wait for him obediently.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Yet, it surprised her when she comprehended what Jacob was doing when he didn't pull his head out for breath for over an hour.At first, she thought he was dead, but then she shook her head since it would be too foolish. Nevertheless, if she hadn't noticed small bubbles appearing occasionally, she might've believed it.Then she thought of another possibility, could it be the secret method to enter the A-rank?Alice felt she stumbled upon an enormous secret when she thought of how Jacob was so serious about this pool and covering it.She even thought of slipping away, but then she thought about how Jacob had already killed eight mercenaries who tried to escape every time!He could really hear everything as he said, so now no one dared to escape!So, she also didn't dare to move and stay there and pretend to be an idiot and hope Jacob would believe it because if it was Jacob's secret of power, then he will kill her to make sure she won't reveal it ever!However, when she saw the water turning into vapors, she was completely stunned and felt this was really the secret of Jacob's power!Now, he was coming this way, so she did her best to act shy and attractive so, he won't notice anything.Jacob looked at the alluring Alice, and his lips curled up. "You know how to adapt. I don't mind, but if you think for a moment that you could escape your fate of being a slave by this, then you're dead wrong."Jacob's eyes turned cold, which made Alice shudder and thought he was going to kill her. But to her surprise."If you truly serve me well, I won't mistreat you, either. Even making you an A-rank within one day is a possibility. But…" Jacob smiled meaningfully, "Can you prove it?"Alice finally looked up with shock and disbelief about what she just heard, and her lips parted. "Y-you can make me A-rank in on-one day?!" She didn't dare to believe it.Jacob merely chuckled mysteriously, took the towel from her hands, and, without caring about her expression, moved on while saying, "Summon Harrison."Alice's heart was almost in her throat as Jacob's words rang in her head continually like a broken record.But she quickly calmed down, and her eyes shimmered with resolved, 'I just have to prove it then.'Although she didn't completely believe Jacob's words. While he didn't kill her despite her comprehending his 'secret', which meant Jacob didn't care at all.Now, more doubts grow in her head, and when she thought about what Jacob just offered her, she now wanted to see if he could make her an A-rank mercenary.Besides, it wasn't like she was losing anything, so she quickly followed Jacob's order and headed to summon Harrison, who was the only one Jacob called by name.Thereupon, Jacob calmly sat on a table full of dishes. He looked at perturbed Harrison, and said, "I want you to call the Guild Leader of the Gunsmith Guild as soon as possible.""As your command, my lord." Harrison quickly left to complete this mission as if his life depended on it.At this time, Alice quickly picked up a dish and started serving Jacob without even him telling her.As she served, she suddenly looked into his cold amber eyes deeply and said in a dreamy tone, "I'm yours from now!"

Chapter 133 Meetings Drew Again
﻿In the evening, the Tyrant Mansion welcomes its first visitor, who was granted an audience with the Silver Tyrant.Many people who were paying close attention to the tyrant's mansion quickly reported this to their superiors.When they found the identity of this visitor, it was none other than the Guild Leader of the Gunsmith Guild of Lionheart City, Drew!Because of Jacob's significance, his background was naturally checked by many. Although his real identity, or from where he hailed, was still a mystery. But his official record at the Start Mercenary Agency and Gunsmith Guild was now an open secret.Everyone knew he first appeared in Rain Town and then lived in Lionheart City. But this also made him more mysterious. Because except for these two locations, Jacob appeared nowhere else in the huge Uncommon Region.Most people believed that Jacob's appearance was actually a disguise to hide his real background. But when the records of the two organizations mention no one sounds sure anymore.Those C-rank and above-rank people knew DNA couldn't be changed, and this is what made them dread the mysterious Silver Tyrant even more.Since he had accepted no visitors before, the information on him was even more precious. Now that he finally accepted a visitor who happened to be someone connected with him, this would arouse much attention.However, Jacob didn't care about it at all as he was sitting on a comfortable divan while facing him was a burly old man with a stiff expression. He was non-other than the Guild Leader of Lionheart City's Gunsmith Branch, Drew.Alice appeared, holding a tray with an exquisite red whiskey bottle and glasses.She gracefully put on the glasses and poured the translucent red whiskey without expression.Drew was shocked when he was this cold yet alluring maid. He naturally knew who this person was and the reason behind her current appearance.Nevertheless, it still shocked him when he saw how obedient Alice was behaving. She had accepted her identity as a mere slave, and no shame could be seen in her behavior. He looked at the handsome man with awe and trepidation.When he heard Jacob was looking for him, his first thought was why he was looking for him after he didn't meet him when he visited.But he didn't dare to reject, and he also wanted to meet Jacob for another reason as well, so he dropped everything and came here post hastily.Alice, at this moment, placed the whiskey glass in front of Drew with no expression. Before, she took the other one and handed it to Jacob with a captivating smile.However, Jacob merely took the glass with an unimpressive glance at Alice, which made her somewhat flustered inwardly. But she maintained her smile, and like an obedient maid stood behind Jacob's divan.Since he didn't tell her to leave, she would remain here and observe. She was also interested in Jacob's past or what kind of person he was. It was crucial in winning Jacob's trust.Jacob also didn't mind Alice since he had already planned for her. He smiled faintly when saw Drew's stiff expression and said, "I heard you visited before?"Drew felt his heart rate increase slightly, but when he saw Jacob still had that arrogant yet confident smirk on his face when they first met.He felt somewhat relieved and politely nodded. "Yes, but your excellency was busy, and I won't dare to disturb you."Jacob took a sip of whiskey which had an intoxicating smoky and malty flavor. He didn't know where Harrison bought this, but it was at least two or three decades old. He was an adorer of good alcohol, and this whiskey was only subpart but still good enough for current human civilization. Furthermore, he chuckled, "There's no need to be polite with an old friend. Just call me Jack. So, why do you want to visit before? I was occupied with something at that time. You can speak freely."Drew was familiar with Jacob's tone, 'Is this really the cold-blooded Silver Tyrant everyone is talking about?' He thought with uncertainty now.Nevertheless, since Jacob still behaved like his old self, he was more at ease and spoke, "To tell you the truth, I didn't want to disturb you, and I wasn't even sure it was you, actually. But your portraits had been spreading all over the kingdom, so I know it was you."Jacob cocked an eyebrow. "I didn't know I become so famous within a week." He sounded surprised, but he wasn't, actually. On the contrary, he was unimpressed. 'This is the real disadvantage of medieval technology.''After you killed a B-rank mercenary and made a Duke's daughter slave, you're still acting in surprise?' Drew smiled wryly and didn't want to comment on this and changed the topic, "Nevertheless, it didn't take long before your information was dug out, especially within the agency and the guild."It's very easy once someone provides them with your registration name, and I think it was that old bastard Olaf who revealed your registration name to the information broker." A hint of anger appeared in his eyes. "I knew what he did back then when you suddenly vanished, but I don't have proof. But that bastard ran too fast the moment you appeared this time."Alice was shocked by this revelation, and she looked at Jacob, who was calmly sipping on his whiskey as if he was listening to trivial things.'Did someone try to scheme against him when he was keeping a low profile, or he wasn't as strong as now before?' She thought."I don't care about this small matter, even if they know about my identity. Do you think they can do anything to me?" Jacob asked with a wintry smile, which made Drew shudder slightly.He knew Jacob merely stated the fact. No one would dare to mess with Jacob right now unless they have a death wish like Samuel. He was the strongest person in the entire Kingdom.Furthermore, he sighed, "Forgive me, I just made a fool out of myself. The important matter why I was here was because I received a message from the Guild Master of Royal Humane City."His expression turned serious as he said, "He'll be visiting you personally, and I think you should hear him out since it might be beneficial to you. But of course, if you didn't want, you could simply reject him."Drew sighed inwardly. The Gunsmith Guild Master of the capital city was an extremely prominent figure. But now he was coming here personally to meet with Jacob, and he even required someone like him to introduce him to Jacob.Drew knew Jacob was actually a Basic Gunsmith, and his attainment might be even higher than this and he was hiding it.So, the visit of this eccentric guild master was not a surprise to him since he would do the same after finding out about Jacob's talent in gunsmithing. He was a freak in his eyes!As long as Jacob announced his relation with the Gunsmith Guild, their status would sour, surpassing the Apothecary Guild!But the person in question was the Silver Tyrant. If he rejected them, would they dare to push their luck? The answer was a huge no!As long as there wasn't someone stronger than Jacob backing them, they couldn't force Jacob to do anything. The Alchemy Guild behind them won't care for their lives as long as no external force intervenes or if they poke a hornet nest themselves.Jacob's eyes flashed with a subtle glint as he nodded. "I'll consider it. Now is the reason I call you here."Drew held his breath. He was even more nervous than the time he took his basic gunsmith exam."I need your assistance in two matters." Jacob stated coolly, "First, I want a gunsmith workshop and a proper smithy in the basement of this mansion. Is it possible? Money is not an issue."Drew's eyes widened slightly and fell into deep thought before he answered, "It can be arranged since you're a basic gunsmith. I can even send a message to capital, and the Guild Master will provide the most advanced equipment we currently have.""Alright, this will work as well." Jacob agreed quickly, "As for the second thing, it's about the pool in the backyard. I want to create an iron platform. Look at this. You'll understand what I'm talking about."Jacob 'pulled out' a paper from a pocket and tossed it toward Drew, who caught it and opened it with uncertainty.Alice was also quite curious about what Jacob was talking about, but she remained expressionless and only observed. She was astonished when she heard he was also a basic gunsmith.As a daughter of a duke, she knew those gunsmiths of basic level were all bunch of Old Men, and their strength was meager, but they were all respected by the Kingdom. Because of the firearms they developed and made their military power strong.Drew saw the design and was slightly shocked, but it was a simple matter for him. He fooled the paper, put it in his pocket, and solemnly nodded, "Consider it done!"

Chapter 134 King’s Move
﻿The next morning,Jacob opened his eyes and then looked at the pale white delicate hand over his muscular chest. A naked beauty was sleeping right beside him, revealing her lascivious assets. She was naturally Alice who tasted the forbidden fruit last night.There wasn't any ripple in Jacob's expression. He was like usual as if it wasn't a big deal for him.But he can't deny the fact that Alice was the first woman he slept with in this world, and she was a noble princess, regardless.Yet, he felt nothing besides the transient pleasure, and all that time, he was controlling his strength or he knew what would've happened if he let himself loose with his current physique.Alice was important to his plan, and he couldn't have her die right now, or it would be hard to find a replacement.That's why he let her get close to him in the first place and give her hope amid despair. He was making it clear she could only rely on him here, and her resistance was meaningless.He could've easily made her a slave with a parasite gem. Furthermore, he still has six low-level parasite gems. It wasn't hard. But he didn't require a puppet this time like the sunset duke.After wearing his clothes, Jacob left the room and headed toward the pool, which has been filled again.He was still working on increasing his heart rate with water meditation, and he felt he might learn how to control it with it, but it was still just speculation. He couldn't even start it yet, nor he was in a hurry.This ability was a double-edged sword, and he didn't was to be on the receiving end of this sword, so he'll take advantage of this situation.Since the pool size wasn't dangerous to him, he'll practice it until Drew's men arrived and started the pool's renovation according to his design.Once it was done, he won't have to worry about it until the three hours mark was crossed.Although it seemed he was wasting time by staying here and not leaving toward the higher region. But Jacob didn't think so, not after he left the sunset duke's estate that day and considered it.If anything, he would lose an opportunity if he left now!After Jacob left, inside his room,Alice, who seemed to be in a deep sleep, suddenly opened her beautiful emerald eyes filled with difficult emotions.When she thought about how bold she was last night, she blushed profusely.'Is he still not convinced that I'm no longer resisting?' She thought as she looked at the place where Jacob was a few moments ago.'Well, how could it be so easy? That man is not as simple as he seemed on the surface. Although he looked young, his eyes are as tranquil as an old-wise king. I don't know if I'm lucky or pitiful.' She thought for a long time absent-mindedly.No matter how cold or indifferent she had been in the past, she was still a young lady with a sky-like ambition.---In the afternoon,Many people entered the tyrant mansion with big horse-drawing carriages which again arouse the spies' attention.After some investigation, it turned out that these people were from the gunsmith guild and some were blacksmiths. The carriages were filled with iron and many blacksmith equipments.As for what they were for, only the people inside that mansion knows, and no one dared to step in it because it was too dangerous.Jacob's every move was monitored because of his current status, and he still hadn't left the mansion yet, as if he had made that place his base of operation.No one could tell what he was planning, but with all these materials and blacksmiths, it was clear he was making something.It draws attention to Gunsmith Guild Leader Drew, who had visited the Tyrant just a day before this large movement started, but Drew also remained silent and indifferent.Just like this, three more days passed,This day, the tyrant mansion received a visit from another noble, but it wasn't just any noble. It was the Marquis who had previously occupied Gloria City and the Baron of Gloria Country also with him.The Lionheart City Lord and many other bigwigs of the Gloria country also followed them.They all wanted to pay respect to the Silver Tyrant who was hailed presumably from the Gloria Country, and the Marquis even wanted to invite Jacob into his fief, even handing over the entire fief as the matter of fact.Yet, they were all rejected at the gates.In the end, they had no choice but to leave since this person wasn't someone who they can push around.However, the Marquis was a shrewd fellow, he didn't leave. Instead, he ordered vacant the entire lion street and bought it the very day.Since he can't have an audience with the Tyrant, he will show his willingness to meet him by living on lion street and paying his respect every day.No one thought that this action was foolish because if he earned Silver Tyrant's goodwill or just his attention, who would dare to mess with him openly again?The Silver Tyrant was even more famous than the King!This action made many nobles panic since they were a step behind.Now, the Marquis, the Gloria Baron, and the Lionheart City Lord all moved on the lion street and completely closed off the area, which also root out the spies of different nobles.This act made many furious, but no one caused a commotion since this Marquis wasn't someone to trifle with, and only a Duke could overpower him.Just like that, an entire month passed without any big moments from the Silver Tyrant except for some carriages going in or out.This day, however, a large movement was reported, but not from the Tyrant, but from the Capital City which has been dormant from the start.A large entourage left the Humane City with many powerful figures, even the Humane King and Knight-Marshal were included, and their destination was none other than Gloria Country, and this entourage was like a small army, nonetheless.Everyone thought that all this time the King was preparing, and now that he was done, the King was finally going to announce his dominance!Although the silver tyrant is portrayed as invincible. But can he fight with an army of knights?No one knew the answer, but one thing was clear: they were going to find out soon.This news also reached lionheart city and the people staying in it.Their first reaction was to vacate the entire city since it will be going to be a colossal mess if the knights fought with Silver Tyrant.Those nobles with Marquis also left the city to a safe area until the result was out.Although they all wanted to form goodwill with Tyrant, they didn't want to burn the bright with the royals either, since it was still unclear who would win. The Tyrant was, after all, just a single person in the end.Besides the members of power square and the tyrant mansion, the entire city was deserted within two days.Jacob, who was looking at the almost done metal pool, naturally received the reports of this movement. Everyone seemed tense, including Alice, who was now even more charming and always stayed at Jacob's side like a shadow.Although she didn't know the limit of Jacob's power, she didn't know if Jacob could fend off an army of trained knights. Especially Knight-Marshal Galant, who was also a Nightmare Knight.The Nightmare Knight Legion was a fable entity between the higher-ups of the humans, and they had too many astonishing legends surrounding them. The Zodiac Warriors Alliance was famous for its unmatched strength, so its members won't be a pushover either.However, Jacob remained calm and aloof. He didn't show any worry about their movement, which made many doubts Jacob's mentality again.At night, Alice lay naked in Jacob's arms with perspiration all over her charming body while her breath was slightly stiff, and she looked at Jacob's impassive face with worry."Are you really not afraid of the King? I heard Philip III is a very astute and wily ruler, and he's someone who enjoyed being in power. He won't let you take away his control so easily." She spoke with worry.It was the only time she could speak and approach Jacob freely, without fear or restraint. She still didn't know if she had won his trust or not, but she was doing her best to earn her spot.Jacob glanced at the alluring beauty who now looked like a mature woman, not a young lady anymore.However, his expression was still apathetic, even after spending a month with her. He suddenly said at this moment, "I heard your father might be in this group. Tell me, will you kill him if asked you to?"

Chapter 135 Gathering At Tyrant Mansion
﻿On this day, a large regiment of armored knights surrounding many big carriages entered the Lionheart City, which was completely deserted at the moment.At the very front was a golden chariot, and its coachman was none other than the Knight-Marshal of the Humane Kingdom, Galant, clad in his black armor."Garrison the city!" His loud, solemn voice reverberated in the vicinity.A small group of knights quickly sprang into action and took the abandoned posts of the lionheart city gates.Except for this small group, the main group continues to travel toward lion street.Many people were paying attention to this from a distance.They knew today the fate of Silver Tyrant or the Royal Family was going to be decided and whoever comes out on top will be the de facto ruler of the entire Humane Kingdom.The King was here with his personal royal knights and the Knight-Marshal, as well as many high-ranking nobles with their personal guards, were also following him.There were three more people who were of superior status in this lineup: the Star Mercenary Agency Master and the strongest B-Rank Mercenary, Loop, before Silver Tyrant appeared.The second was the Intermediate Gunsmith and the face of the Gunsmith Guild, Isham.Lastly, the Guild Leader of the Apothecary Guild of the capital city's branch and also known as the Miracle Hands, Blake.Just these three were enough to stir a tremendous storm in the Humane Kingdom, but they never appeared together.Now, not only the members of Black Knights, with a Nightmare Knight but all the represented of main guilds in Humane King have appeared together with the King himself.No one knew how Silver Tyrant will react or what these people were going to do today. But it's going to be history for sure.Soon, the marching knights and carriages entered lion street and approached the Tyrant Mansion without stopping.In the Tyrant Mansion, the atmosphere was as tense as it could get.All those tiger's den mercenaries were extremely anxious since they knew an army was coming, and they might become the very first ones to suffer if the Silver Tyrant didn't yield.They were all living constantly in fear of the Silver Tyrant all this time because every time they tried to escape or sneak out of the mansion, the silver tyrant would mysteriously kill them and leave their corpses for everyone to see.So, they knew escaping was impossible under an A-rank expert.But now the entire kingdom's experts were coming, and they were even more appalled because they all knew what kind of personality Silver Tyrant had, and there was over 80% chance that he will start fighting than compromise.At this moment, sounds of powerful footsteps rang in the silent vicinity of lion street, and those mercenaries knew they had arrived!"What are you doing? Since the army is here, do you still think he has the time to care about us? That motherfucker is treating us like miners and killing us without batting an eye. Besides, I don't think he can survive an army attack. He's just one person!" A short man with bruises on his face whispered to the man beside him, who was all filled with bruises.They had all been digging constantly every day for the past month and only had been excused two days ago. If they weren't C-rank, they might've died of the workload and suffocation.Nevertheless, this still affects their mental states greatly, and all the pride they once had long been shattered.But they still didn't submit completely and wanted to be free and required just a small opening.Now that the chance was here, if they didn't use it, they would either be killed or be used as cannon folds in this upcoming event.After thinking for a moment, the man beside the short man decisively nodded. "The moment the army barge in, we'll flee from the east side."Not only these two, but almost all the tiger's den men have these thoughts.As for women, they were living 'comfortably' in the mansion, and they would see them now and then working as maids, which was far better than mining like slaves.As for their vice-captain Alice, she had completely changed and submitted to Silver Tyrant or it could also be just a sham until she had a chance to escape or even backstabbed him.Whatever the case was, everyone was for themselves right now.At this moment, sounds of hooves suddenly stopped at the main gate, and everyone saw a golden chariot stopping in front of the mansion while the black armor Galant gazed at the mansion coldly.At this moment, he opened his mouth, and a powerful voice reverberated in the vicinity, "The King of Humane Kingdom demands an audience with Silver Tyrant!"However, he wasn't the only one. Another voice rang from a carriage. "The Star Mercenary Agency seeks an audience with Senior Silver Tyrant!"Another followed thereupon, "The Gunsmith Guild seeks an audience with Senior Silver Tyrant!"Lastly, "The Apothecary Guild seeks an audience with his excellency Silver Tyrant!"Everyone was dumbfounded because they all thought they would barge in and then demand Silver Tyrant to come out, but it didn't happen.Besides the King demanding an audience which seemed quite appropriate for his status, the other three bigwigs were very polite. As if they would turn back if the Silver Tyrant rejected them.Now everyone was waiting for the Silver Tyrant's reply, and if he acted unreasonably, he would lose his reputation and make it even worse than it already had been.They didn't have to wait for long, though.At this moment, the closed door of the mansion parted, and a middle-aged man wearing butler attire with an expressionless face appeared. He was Harrison, and right now he was as famous as Silver Tyrant under the title of Silver Tyrant Butler.However, unlike in the past, Harrison didn't seem as old or timid while facing such pressure, and his eyes were filled with boundless confidence and hidden might.He walked toward the gates followed by a group of beautiful maids who were former C-rank mercenaries of Tiger's Den.Galant's eyes narrowed when he saw Harrison, and for some reason, he felt slightly threatened by this Butler which made him somewhat baffled. But his expression didn't change at all and remained stoic.Harrison eyed the legendary figure and the former strongest expert of the Humane Kingdom, and a peculiar glint flashed past his eyes.But he didn't lose his bearing as the butler of the Tyrant and bowed lightly before he uttered in an impassive tone, "My Lord welcome everyone, and he invites anyone with the status of Duke and higher inside. As for the three organizations, he would only welcome B-Rank Mercenaries and Basic Apothecaries. Except the Gunsmith Guild is granted entry as a whole. As for everyone else…"Harrison suddenly straightened his back and coldly looked at the Marshal and said, "They didn't have the qualification to meet my lord!"The atmosphere become icy all of a sudden when Harrison's voice faded, and those mercenaries looked at the butler, baffled by his guts. Galant squinted his eyes as he looked at Harrison coldly. He didn't know why, but this butler was really making him uneasy. By the way; he was staring at him with no fear, it made him even more sure that this man wasn't simple."The Star Mercenary Agency agreed!""The Gunsmith Guild gratefully agreed.""The Apothecary Guild agreed with his excellency's arrangement."Soon the representatives of the three organizations quickly agreed with this arrangement, and only the King was left to agree on behalf of the Kingdom."Granted!" An imposing voice sounded within the golden chariot filled with authority, but there was a hint of resignation mixed within.Harrison's lip curled up slightly and bowed again before he ordered, "Open the gates!"Soon, fifteen carriages entered the tyrant mansion with the golden chariot.Nine out of fifteen carriages belonged to the gunsmith guild, while others were from different organizations and duke-rank figures.The other carriages waited outside with the knights.Galant disembarked the chariot and opened the door respectfully.Soon, Philip III disembarked the carriage wearing silver king's robes, and a handsome young man followed suit, who was the crown prince of the Humane Kingdom, Jude.From behind, Riley Duke appeared with a somewhat anxious expression.Another duke disembarked his carriage. He was the youngest brother of the King, and the second duke of the Humane Kingdom, Duke Nathan.Then three mercenaries appeared, two tall men and a mature, beautiful woman. They were all B-ranks!Two Basic Apothecary, and three Basic Gunsmiths with some other important members of the Gunsmith Guild."Ladies and Gentlemen, please follow me." Harrison signal."That Butler isn't simple. Heh, this trip might be more advantageous than we thought." A tall middle-aged mercenary softly uttered to his companions before they followed behind Harrison like everyone else.Before long, they all entered the mansion under many eyes, and the gates were closed. No one knows what they're going to discuss with Silver Tyrant.But everyone was now waiting for the end result!

Chapter 136 King Philip III
﻿Harrison led everyone toward the main hall where sitting was arranged beforehand.However, no one cared about the decoration or any other thing, but everyone's focus was on the tall, long silver hair man with a devilish appearance wearing black. He was calmly sitting on a throne chair while looking at them impassively. He was none other than Silver Tyrant.They all had seen this man's portraits and heard the stories about his prowess and tyranny, but in person, he looked nothing like the rumor.Alice also stood behind Jacob with no emotions on her gorgeous icy face, but if someone observed her closely, she was slightly taller, and her appearance was more mature and alluring. She also didn't wear her maid outfit today, but a beautiful black dress, outlining her mature captivating figure.Even the expressionless Philip couldn't help but glance at Alice twice with some ripple in his eyes.The most astonishing was naturally Duke Riley, Alice's father. From the spies' reports, Alice was working as a maid, but now she didn't look like a maid or slave at all.On the contrary, he could tell his daughter was even more beautiful and seemed more confident than her past self.As for those B-Rank mercenaries, including Galant, they couldn't tell if Jacob was dangerous or not because he didn't have any kind of dangerous vibe around him. On the contrary, they felt danger from the charming woman standing behind Jacob!Jacob looked at everyone, and he didn't have any intention of moving from his position. He impassively spoke, "Everyone, please have a seat." His deep voice was filled with authority."Please." Harrison gestured for them to pick a seat there was a total of 50 seats facing Jacob's.No one makes a fuss, even Philip, and they all sat down according to their status.The more important ones were sitting in front while the ones with lower status were at the back.Jacob looked at everyone, and before anyone could speak, he again took the lead, "How about we start with introductions? I'm unfamiliar with everyone, but I know everyone here knows me. But as a host, I'll introduce myself properly. I'm Jacob Steve or Silver Tyrant, whichever you guys prefer."No one hesitated afterward and introduced themselves well except Philip. He remained silent while looking at Jacob emotionlessly. His introduction was done by Galant.Jacob merely nodded at everyone's greeting. While he also felt some ill intent from three people, he was extremely sensitive to danger because of his heightened senses. But he said nothing.After the introduction was done, Jacob spoke. "Since the pleasantries are out of the way, let's come to the main topic. I don't enjoy talking in circles, and I know everyone here is for something, including me."He then looked at Philip, who hadn't spoken since the start, and calmly said, "How about we start with the king? What did His Majesty want?"The room was silent as everyone looked at Jacob, who seemed completely fearless. He never showed any gesture or respect toward Philip from the start, and neither did Philip utter a single word.No one knows why Philip even agreed to meet with Jacob, who could kill him if wanted and not remain hidden within his army.Although there were four B-rankers present in this hall, three of them had no desire to fight with Jacob, and they will not act even if Philip's life was threatened. Only Galant was his shield.But when they looked at the butler and the charming woman standing by Jacob's side, they knew Jacob wasn't the only threat here. He was more mysterious and unfathomed than any of them have thought.They couldn't even sense danger from Jacob, which means he wasn't a danger, but death itself, which can't be sensed or gauged!Even those two Dukes keep their mouths shut and just observe. Duke Riley also kept a lid on it, or he really wanted to question Jacob about making his daughter a slave.Slavery wasn't legal in the Humane Kingdom well, at least on the surface.But Duke Riley didn't have the guts to say those exact words anymore, and he couldn't even tell if his daughter was really a slave or if all this was just a sham. But he will let his brother take the lead this time and test the water.King Philip finally spoke under Jacob's cold eyes, "Since Sir. Jacob is so straightforward, it would be rude for us to not do the same."As Sir said, I was indeed here for something, and that was to see if you are strong enough to fight with an army or not. I want to see if you could be tame."Everyone looked at Philip as if he was a madman at this moment, and they wanted to get further away from him. He was simply crazy to say those words out loud before Jacob.Either he didn't want to live anymore, or he was simply confident in walking here alive.Philip's blunt provocation flabbergasted even the two Dukes. He would never do this normally. They wondered if he lost his will to fight after meeting Jacob and now wanted to drag everyone down with him.Galant was also tense when he heard this and subconsciously tightened his muscles. If Jacob attacked, he'll have no choice but to act as well.Harrison's expression also turned slightly dangerous at this moment, while a ruthless glint flashed past Alice's eyes.However, Jacob didn't appear angry at all. On the contrary, he suddenly smiled amusingly and said, "So, what do you think now? Is it possible to achieve?"Philip shook his head and said, "No, you're far more powerful than anyone in this room. I never thought the Human Kingdom will have an expert like you. So, I'm willing to submit the throne to you with no resistance."Another astonishing silence descended after Philip's declaration."Your Majesty!"The crown prince, Jude, Galant, and two dukes were abruptly shouted because this was too crazy!Philip never said anything about handing over the Kingdom's throne to Silver Tyrant.However, Philip completely ignored them and smiled. "But even if I'm willing to give away the throne, you won't take it since it isn't what you want. So, can you tell me what you want now?"Jacob couldn't help but looked Philip in a new light. 'So, this is the current King of Humane Kingdom, huh? A wise and ruthless ruler indeed. If the Killer Skull Society hadn't been involved, he might lead the Kingdom in some unexpected direction.'pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ It was his view of Philip. He was really a politician and knew how to read situations well.Jacob replied, "Indeed, I don't want your throne nor kingdom. But my goal is not something you guys should know."Everyone looked at Jacob and Philip with uncertainty. No one knew what was the other party thinking. They were evenly matched in this psychological game of words.But the difference was Philip was bound to lose in the end.Jacob continued, "I will give you advice before you leave. Don't start a war with trolls unless you want a complete annihilation of your people. I won't interfere no matter what, I'm just a passerby, and I'll leave this place any time I want, and no one will be able to stop me."Philip looked at Jacob deeply before he frowned. "You know something, don't you, about that abrupt war?"They all looked seriously at Jacob now. It was completely unexpected.Jacob merely chuckled and didn't hide. "I know enough, and trust me, you'll be doing the trolls a favor if you start the war. My discussion with the members of the three hegemonies was also related to this topic."But I don't think anyone who isn't a member of the three hegemonies should hear it. It's for your good."Now that you have got your answer, you should leave. I won't interfere with your kingdom politics, and I don't want any kingship, either. I would leave once I achieved my aim. This place is nothing but countryside for me."The members of the royal family were all baffled by Jacob's ambiguous answer and the way he was talking.While the members of the three hegemonies were startled, it appeared there wasn't the only one with motives to approach Jacob, but he had his motives as well, and this motive might be even bigger than theirs.Philip really didn't like this situation because he could guess something was amiss with the trolls from the start, and Jacob knew, but he didn't want to leave when he was so close to the truth.But Jacob had already clarified that it would be dangerous for them to know while giving a subtle warning."Will the Knight-Marshal be part of this discussion since he's a member of the Nightmare Knight Legion?" He asked."Yes, that's why I said three hegemonies." Jacob merely chuckled."Very well. I'll be waiting outside for the marshal." Philip gave a meaningful look at Galant before he stood up.Duke Riley seemed to hesitate as he glanced at Alice.Jacob coldly said at this moment, "You two leave as well!"

Chapter 137 A Secret (1)
﻿After the meeting with the nobles of the Humane Kingdom, which only took about ten minutes of Jacob's time, only the members of the three hegemonies remained.Jacob even sent Alice and Harrison out because it would make everyone more serious about what Jacob was about to tell them.He didn't even let King Philip hear it, so it naturally drew others' attention.Jacob looked at the top members of three organizations and coolly asked, "Before I start, can I ask why the three of you wanted to visit me together? I can understand the mercenary agency and gunsmith guild, but what about the Apothecary Guild? I had no ties with them."Jacob looked at ebony face man who looked ordinary and calm, but he was actually the Miracle Hands, Blake, the top Apothecary of the Humane Kingdom, and beside him was a middle age man with noble bearing, he was the vice leader of the Apothecary Guild Dylan.Blake had observed Jacob's conversation with Philip and knew how hard it was to deal with Philip, but even that man seemed helpless against him and could only give up.Nevertheless, Philip got what he wanted, and there was no need for him to push Jacob around. All he wanted was authority over the Humane Kingdom, and since Jacob wasn't interested, he had no reason to make an enemy of Jacob.As Jacob said, this place was like the countryside to him, and he would leave when the time comes, and everyone believed him.Blake smiled politely and said, "I'm Blake. Your excellency is far more extraordinary than the rumors describe you to be. I also didn't enjoy beating around the bush, nor do I know how. I'm just a public servant and here, for this exact matter, which will increase the variety of our servers."My two fellow associates from the Gunsmith Guild and Star Mercenary Agency might have the same purpose as me."Blake suddenly looked toward the tall, middle-aged man with a handsome appearance, wearing light black armor. He was Loop, the mercenary agency leader, and then Isham, who was an old man with bronze skin and white hair.Blake smiled meaningfully at them, which made both of them glare at him.This revelation did not surprise Jacob, and neither was Galant, who was silently watching.Since Loop and Isham didn't retort to Blake's claim, he continued, "Your excellency, the thing is since you're the first A-Rank Mercenary among the humans, this signifies something extraordinary for the entire human society.""Oh? I'm listening." Jacob was slightly intrigued.Blake nodded and spoke, "As you may know, Humans are known for being an uncommon species since we originate from an uncommon region. But this is not our actual rank, or more clearly, this rank is not perpetual."Jacob's eyes narrowed when he comprehended the hidden meaning behind Blake's words. "You mean the uncommon rank is like a price tag that can be changed by the quality of the goods at any time? But who put this price tag or put it simply, who decided the rank of the human species?"Jacob clearly had no idea about how a species' rank was decided and after he found out about the bloodline limit break, this also means a species' rank wasn't permanent. They can evolve with limit breaks, and the titan tears' existence was proof of this.Meanwhile, the twelve common tiers and nine rare tiers sound more like some level system than species classification.It would be more accurate to say that beings were divided into levels with countless possibilities to reach a higher level. As for the threshold of these levels, it might be the real scale to separate species.Nevertheless, it was still unclear, and Jacob wasn't strong enough to know about these levels yet. As Immortika said, with his meager strength, it won't make any difference, even if Jacob had all the knowledge of this world.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ But what Blake just said also straightened his theory about the levels of individuals and that nothing was permanent besides one's own limit.Blake couldn't help smiling profoundly when he heard Jacob putting a complicated thing in such a simple way. He nodded. "As his excellency just said, it's a mere tag that can be changed by the quality at any time."But it's not so simple either. We were given an uncommon title when we joined the ranks of intelligent species. Although even those mindless animals also have the uncommon tag, as an intelligent species we have the right to change it as long as we complete some certain conditions."At this time, Loop spoke, "Guild Leader Blake, as always, left some important details. Let me fill them up to make it easy to understand."Blake merely glanced at Loop but didn't stop him.Loop also won't let Blake stool the limelight and quickly say, "The uncommon species rank was given to humans on the base we can only remain in uncommon ranks."To gain this rank, we have to show our ability to adapt and prove that we were worthy of this rank. But even that wasn't enough unless we could draw the attention of someone with the power to give us this rank."More than a hundred years ago, when we were hunted down by the goblins and trolls like livestock and still live in rural tribes, we didn't just acquire the kingdom title of our own. But with someone's help, who happened to be the person who had the authority to grant us the uncommon rank!" Loop stated mysteriously.Jacob's eyes narrowed slightly. 'It seemed I was right about humans having the protection of someone from the upper regions, or those trolls and goblins won't let them establish their kingdom so easily and then let them grow.'This might be the biggest secret of the Humane Kingdom, and even the killer skull society might didn't know about it, and if they continue to push them around in that war…'Galant coldly spoke at this moment while meaningfully looking at Jacob, "I think you have already guessed it!"

Chapter 138 A Secret (2)
﻿Jacob calmly looked at Galant and asked, "So, you guys have a backer, and if the trolls really wanted to exterminate humans, you guys will contact that backer. Am I right?"Galant didn't hide and nodded, "Yes."But Jacob suddenly smiled, "But you guys didn't and let thousands of people die and almost lost your capital. Let me guess, you can only contact this person once, and it might not be for help either."This call is for something else, and after listening to you guys, I reckon it has something to do with the rank change. Did I guess right?"Galant and everyone else in the room's eyes widened when they heard this because it was exactly the case!It was a core secret that people with the same status inside this room could only know.But Jacob had guessed it with little clues. The threat of this man in front of them reached another level higher.Isham spoke for the first time at this moment, "Your excellency really deserved to be the strongest in the entire uncommon region."You have guessed almost all the truth and the biggest secret of humans, which didn't know by many."This method of communication was indeed for us to increase our rank once the time comes. We also weren't sure if that benefactor would help us solve this crisis, it has been over hundreds of years already, and that person might not be alive anymore."That's why we were hesitating for long, but then you appeared, and the war stopped, and we didn't have to waste that chance at all."But not only your appearance solved the crisis, but it also completed one of the conditions to raise our rank from uncommon to rare."Jacob was quite curious about these conditions now. "What are the other conditions?"Loop answered, "The most important one is someone with A-rank strength, which will prove our bloodline potentiating. Then we required an advanced-level figure in any profession. Either an Advance Gunsmith or an Advance Apothecary. Lastly, a Nightmare Knight."Once these three conditions were complete, we were told that we would be granted a safe passage and a piece of land in the rare region, and our species would then upgrade to the rare species as well."The entire process wasn't described, but the three hegemonies have a very important part in this. That's why we were here to discuss these with you, and King Philip also knew about it."But under the pretext of testing your strength, he led the army here, but it seemed we were underestimating his excellency."Galant flashed a sharp glance at Loop when he heard this timid fellow who always hid whenever he saw him in the past now had become brave enough to bad-mouth the king in front of him without having any fear.But he knew he couldn't do anything to Loop with Jacob here, and Loop knew that too so he could only pretend he heard nothing.Isham ignored Loop's content expression after getting back at Galant and sincerely looked at Jacob, "From his excellency's record, you're also a Basic Gunsmith, but Drew said you might have the skills of an Advance Gunsmith. It means all the conditions can be met, and we can upgrade our rank and leave this place for good."Didn't your excellency want to go in the rare region also? This way, you can take your entire race with you and don't have to be afraid of being lonely."Not only that, but I heard the resources in the rare region were also ample, and every species with an A-rank expert had many advantages over those without any."Even if you don't want to be a ruler, as long as you help us upgrade our rank, we'll be eternally grateful and all the future generations for this immeasurable kindness." Everyone looked at Jacob with hope in their eyes.They were all here to persuade Jacob to agree to this, and he didn't have any reason to say no because he wasn't losing anything. On the contrary, once they enter the rare region, he would have millions of loyal followers under him.It was far better than being alone.Jacob's expression didn't change at all, and looked at all of them somewhat amused, and said, "If only it was so easy. Since you guys said your piece, let me say mine now. It was also the reason I sent the nobles out."Everyone looked at each other with uncertainty. They were forgotten for the moment that Jacob also had something to tell them that required the absence of the nobles.Galant also looked at Jacob with some suspicion, because Jacob didn't seem to be moved at all, as if this was a trivial matter.Jacob coolly said at this moment, "I'm warning everyone if any of this information leaks from this room, trust me, no one will remain alive. Not even me, and we all have to be extremely secretive about it. Is that clear?"Everyone nodded with grave expressions when they heard this. Even an A-rank expert like Jacob was afraid."First, I would like to break your illusion. I'm not the only A-rank expert in uncommon. But the trolls also have one, and they had one far before my appearance!" Jacob said matter-of-factly."How is that possible?!" Galant rebutted without hesitation.He knew this was nothing but a joke because they won't be alive if trolls had an A-rank expert, and they also won't back down if they had one since they won't fear Jacob at all.Everyone thought the same.Jacob expected it and calmly said, "See? You know nothing about anything. Let me ask you again, do you know about the killer skull society?"Again silence, and everyone looked at Jacob with doubt since they had never heard of this name before.Jacob sighed ruefully, "Yet, you still dare to think of entering the rare region? How laughable. I want everyone to contact higher region branches, and if you can't then use that opportunity to contact that person and tell him that the Killer Skull Society…!"

Chapter 139 Retreat?
﻿In the grand room, the nobles were waiting for the meeting between Jacob and the members of the three hegemonies to get over.It had already been over half an hour.Philip was deep in thought without showing any expression.While Duke Riley wanted to have a private chat with his daughter alone so they have also gone somewhere.Harrison stood on the side of the west corridor, which led toward the meeting hall with an expressionless face. He was guarding this place so no one could disturb Jacob.At this moment, the sounds of footsteps from the corridor sounded, and everyone looked over. They knew the meeting was over, and Philip was very curious about what Jacob spoke about in private.Philip knew Galant won't hide it from him. That guy was loyal to a fault. That was why he wasn't worried when he left the meeting hall.Thereupon, Galant followed by the Loop, Isham, Blake, and others appeared, but everyone felt something wasn't right because their expressions were ashen, as if they had seen a ghost.Philip squinted his eyes with curiosity. He really wanted to know what made those high and aloof members of the three organizations lose their composure, including Galant who seldom shows such expression.However, before Philip could ask or say anything, Galant said with a pale expression, "We should leave post hastily, your majesty!"Philip looked deeply at Galant before he nodded. "Let's go."He then looked at Harrison and said, "Please deliver my gratitude to Sir. Jacob for giving us his personal time, and he's welcome at the palace at any time he wants."Harrison bowed slightly in acknowledgment without saying anything.Loop with his other two vice leaders and Blake with his vice leader also didn't want to stay and followed behind.Isham was the same, but he didn't just leave and looked at the burly middle age man and ordered, "You'll stay here with four others and arrange the equipment to his excellency's preference."I have to leave. This matter is too serious and doesn't even whisper about it or let the others. Because even if an iota of what we just hear is true, then we're really in a huge predicament, and we can't have our enemies alert."pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ The middle age man was the vice gunsmith guild leader, Kishon.Kishon was still incredulous and didn't want to believe what Jacob said, but they couldn't ignore it either because once they contact the upper regions, they will find out if it was true or not.If it was really true, then they won't just need the rare or rarer region's help, but they needed even stronger help to escape this crisis.Kishon nodded and quickly agreed with Isham's arrangement.Although they were here to meet with Jacob and also delivered the best equipment they had for a gunsmith, this turn of events was unexpected, so Isham had to leave now or he was planning to set up the workshop himself to earn Jacob's goodwill.Duke Riley also appeared at this moment with a somewhat listless expression, while Alice didn't appear.Duke Nathan looked at Duke Riley and sighed ruefully. He had guessed that his niece wasn't like the past, and now he was sure of it. But it seemed Duke Riley's problem was meager compared to those bigwigs. He was also curious about what Jacob revealed to make them in such a hurry.At this moment, the crowd outside was waiting for the result of this meeting, and when the closed door of the mansion opened, everyone looked with anticipation while holding their breaths.Especially those enslaved mercenaries of Tiger's Den. They wanted Silver Tyrant to fall off with the Humane Kingdom, which will make the army outside attack, and they will have their chance to escape.However, to everyone's surprise, every bigwig quickly approached their respective carriage without showing any intention of attacking the tyrant's mansion.King Philip also embarked on his chariot, and Knight-Marshal Galant took the rein with a solemn expression and drove it toward the exit.Galant opened his mouth at this moment, "Retreat march!" His voice was loud and clear.All those knights surrounding the mansion were somewhat bewildered by this order, but they quickly followed the order, and just as they appeared, they surrounded the carriages and retreated back.The other nobles in the carriages were also baffled by this retreat order since they all knew King Philip wasn't someone who would retreat like this when his position was in danger.They were now curious about what had happened in the tyrant's mansion.Only the carriages of the gunsmith guild have remained in the mansion now while everyone left.King Philip looked at Galant and spoke, "What happened?"Crown Prince Jude wasn't in the chariot at this moment, and this was deliberately done by Philip, to make sure this conversion won't be heard.He wanted to know what Jacob discussed with them and if has agreed to be the face of humans for the upgradation process.Galant didn't turn around but his grave voice sounded which could only be heard by Philip, "Your Majesty, if what that man name Jacob said is true, then our lives might not be ours anymore, and we're just livestock in a terrifying existence eye."I need to contact the legion in the rare region and confirm this as soon as possible. If it turned out to be true, then we should just use that device to report this and hope they are strong enough to save us, or I don't think humanity will ever be free anymore."Philip's eyes contracted when he heard Galant's ambiguous answer, and his calm expression contorted for the first time. He knew Galant would never say those words, which means this was really a serious problem and much greater than trolls or Jacob."Just what that man revealed?" He asked sternly.Galant suddenly gnashed his teeth before he uttered three words and no longer talk anymore, "Killer Skull Society!"

Chapter 140 Everything Is Set!
﻿At this moment, Jacob still sat on his throne chair with a faint smile on his face, as if he was in an excellent mood.The closed-door suddenly opened at this moment, and a graceful woman entered, who was none other than Alice.Jacob looked at Alice and said impassively, "So, how did it go with your father?"He still remembered when he asked her if she could kill her father for him. Her answer was very decisive and out of Jacob's expectations.She answered, 'I won't kill him, but if he stood against you, I'll do it!'Although Jacob's question was to test Alice's mindset and just how far she was willing to go for power or his favor. After getting this answer, Jacob was content with Alice and was qualified to be his pawn.Alice catwalks toward Jacob as her icy expression breaks into a charming smile, and she stated, "He's as selfish as ever and wanted information on you. But I just made it clear I'm no longer his tool anymore, and he won't say such a thing anymore."This answer did not surprise Jacob, as he had already expected this. "A trivial matter then. What about your new strength? How confident are you in defeating the kingdom's marshal?"When Alice heard this couldn't help but remembered that two black drops Jacob made her consume after she gave him that answer. She first thought Jacob was poisoning her since she didn't like her repose.But the moment she consumed those two black drops, she felt a strange energy, and soon, she felt her power increase by a large margin. Then Jacob took out a strange device that could measure her strength.She was shocked when she heard she was already a B-rank, and after trying some exercises; she knew Jacob wasn't joking and was completely convinced that Jacob could help her achieve A rank strength in a day if he wanted with that mysterious black liquid.She was even more shocked and sure when Jacob made Harrison achieve the same strength as her, who wasn't even an F-rank the next day. Her doubts had completely vanished, and she knew Jacob had many secrets, and his prowess might not be just at A-rank.Now, she didn't even think of double-crossing Jacob. She truthfully answered, "Marshal Galant is still stronger because of his vast experience in the army, and I heard he had practiced the fabled Fighter Manual of the Nightmare Knight Legion. That's why even those three B-rank mercenaries leaders can't do anything to him."There was a hint of respect in her voice for Galant.Jacob nodded because he also thought Galant was almost an A-rank and he just needed some kind of push, and if he gave him just one drop of titan tears, he would break into the ranks of A-rank experts.Just like Alice, who was at the peak of C-rank, easily achieved B-rank after consuming just two titan tears drops while Harrison required 81 drops to achieve B-rank level strength.As for why Jacob chose Harrison and was willing to spend this many titan drops on him, only Jacob knew for now. But Harrison was also now quite loyal and wanted to learn the fighting skills from Alice so he could use his strength more accurately.Jacob looked at Alice, who was already standing in front of him, and said, "I have a mission for you and if you complete it, you'll receive 10 more drops of black liquid."Alice's eyes shimmered in ecstasy when she heard this and blurted, "Tell me, I'll do anything!"Jacob's lips curled, and told, "Make a trip to the Aureate Kingdom and keep an eye out for anything strange there. If I'm not wrong, trolls might be up to something, and since they withdraw from here, they might seek goblins for trouble next."If a war started there, I want you to observe if they're collecting the blood of goblins and if they did, there's no need to get involved and come back without alerting any."But I'm warning you, there might be an existence as strong as me present there if the war started, so don't get caught, or you'll be dead."Alice's expression changed when she heard this, "Just what is going on with these wars, and why are such powerful people appearing here?"She was naturally curious about this, like anyone else, and Jacob seemed to know more. But what truly made her aghast there were more existences, like Jacob involved here."I also wanted to find out what was going on, and this war might answer some questions. Now prepare. Leave whenever you're ready and hide your tracks. You don't need to serve me. Report back in a year if nothing happened." Jacob sternly ordered.Alice said nothing before she left with a stern expression. She knew this mission was going to be very difficult, but she was willing to take the risk since it was only about spying, and once she completed it, she would be closer to becoming an A-rank or even higher.Jacob watched Alice leave as an astute glint flashed past his eyes, 'If I'm not wrong, this war and blood collection is related to that mutant which I discovered in that forest and that underground lab.'There's something in human blood that draw Killer Skull Society here, and it might not be replicable. But it remained to be seen if it was only humans or the uncommon region which interested the Killer Skull Society.'But I'm eighty percent sure this is all related to that mutant and lab. To get an accurate answer, I just needed to find that mutant body. I knew where it was, and they even had some research data on it.'Once this becomes clear, and the Humane Kingdom does as I said, everything will be set in place… I would reap enormous benefits without getting under anyone's radar, and no one would ever know this.'I need to act in three months just to be on the safe side and make sure to get rid of future trouble. Now that the pool project is complete, I need to learn and control at least 1X fluid acceleration!'
