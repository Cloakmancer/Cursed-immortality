Chapter 101 Dark City (2)
﻿Jacob was speechless when he heard this receptionist's blunt way of handling guests, and then he remembered that coarse voice who inspected the ID card. He wondered if everyone here was arrogant and cranky.Nevertheless, since they could build such a city in the middle of nowhere and give shelter to anyone who entered without being worried about even three hegemonies, he won't cause trouble without any good reason.As long as they played by rules, he didn't mind obeying them.He took out ten gold coins and ten silvers and place them on the counter, "Ten Day Pass and that guild book."The masked receptionist coolly took the coins and asked, "Your name? Any name is fine."Jacob thought for a moment and then answered, "Jack."The masked receptionist started to move her hands under the counter, which Jacob failed to see. He didn't know what she was doing, but he waited.After a minute, the masked receptionist put a bronze card with strange wording engraved on one side, and when Jacob saw the other side. His eyes dilated because a timer 09D:23H: 59M:58S was running on it.He also noticed a dark-capped symbol on the top of this timer."When this timer reached all the way to zero, you'll have fifteen minutes to leave the Dark City or to recharge this timer again. Remember this, we will know when it reached zero and can find you anywhere as long as you are in the vicinity of Dark City, so don't try anything funny."If you neglected this, the City Guards will detain you and impersonate you in the dungeon for three days and torture you. Afterward, they'll throw you out, and you'll be banned from entering the Dark City for three months."The receptionist coolly explained before she put a pocket-size book on the counter, "Your Dark City Guide Book. Now you can get out of my face."Jacob picked up the bronze card and small book, but he didn't leave and asked, "Last question: why is this city in the uncommon region?"The masked receptionist sounded annoyed by this question. "Because many depraved and illicit bastards like you ran into the uncommon region when you have no place to go, and it's good for business. Now go, or those four haven't had a decent exercise in a while."'What a bitch,' Jacob scoffed before he left toward the barricade.One of the tall guards coldly glance at Jacob before he opened the way for him.Jacob didn't mind them and continued moving, and he finally crossed the gate and entered the clean valley way which was made of solid stones.As he moved forward, he finally reached the end, where he saw many capped figures moving in masks.Jacob noticed this entire city was surrounded by steep mountains on each side, and only this valley led to the exit. Furthermore, he could spot small green balls embedded on these mountain walls.'No wonder she sounded so confident about this place. What a peculiar organization.'As he entered the city, he noticed many tall buildings made of stones and marble while there weren't any carriages, and everyone was sauntering on the city streets.However, Jacob could feel the murderous sensations from many capped figures, and he knew they weren't just ideal citizens, and he had to remain on guard.Although that voice told him no fighter or provoked others, some lunatics might not care about such penalties.As Jacob moved in the east direction, he noticed a butcher shop, and his eyes widen even so slightly when he saw the skewered uncommon animals.He entered the shop, and a large, burly man in a mask was sitting on a chair with a book in his hand.He didn't stand to greet Jacob and coldly said, "How much meat do you want?"Jacob didn't mind his attitude and said, "Do you have Rare Meat?"The masked man coldly said, "I only have five pounds in stock. The next supply will come in two days. How much do you want? One pound for 1000 Gold Coins, and the price is non-negotiable!"Jacob's heart raced slightly when he heard this because he had yet to encounter a rare beast, but this guy had a source. This was simply a godsend to him.He promptly asked, "Can you arrange a rare heart and one-liter blood of the same species? I'm willing to pay handsomely. However, the blood and heart have to be from the same beast, and I can tell this, so don't put on a facade. If you can't arrange it, I'm good with just meat."The masked man's blue eyes suddenly shimmered with uncertainty. "It can be arranged. You can collect your delivery in two days. But I can only deliver one heart and blood after fifteen days intervals. The price will be 10,000 Gold Coins."Jacob couldn't help but celebrate inwardly when he heard this guy agreeing to supply him with heart and blood. Fifteen Days were nothing for him.He swiftly agreed. "Fine, save ten pounds of meat for me as well. I'll come in two days. Where can I sell precious iron here?"Jacob didn't have this many gold coins on him, so his only option was to sell titan iron bricks. He never thought he would do that, but the gold coins were nothing compared to rare heart and blood. Furthermore, he didn't tell him about the most important condition, which was he wanted the heart and blood of the new species every time. He would wait for their first transaction before he would put this condition.If this guy had some kind of rare beast farm, then their deal would be over and he would buy the rare meat from him, nonetheless.The masked man seemed amused by this question. "Are you new in Dark City?""Does it matter?" Jacob squinted his eyes."Heh, if you didn't know about Jerry's Pawnshop, then you're definitely new. However, since you and I have a business deal, I'll point you in the right direction. Go to the central city district, and asked anyone about the Jerry's Pawn Shop, and they'll point you in the correct direction." He chuckled."See you in two days." Jacob nodded before he left.The masked man's eyes shimmered coldly. 'Another rich newcomer, huh? I wonder how long his wealth last in this bottomless hole like a city. In the Dark City, there are always things you wanted to buy, and no amount of wealth is not enough. This is how the Dark City sucked you dry before you become the slave to Dark City…'A sigh escaped his mouth before he stopped caring about a newcomer like Jacobs. He had seen too many scions coming into the dark city before they turned into beggars and were thrown out after torture.The only successful person in the Dark City was; who knows how to make profits or you were just filling other pockets.Jacob had no idea about the butcher's thoughts as he moved toward the center area. He also scouted three more butcher shops, and to his surprise, they all can sell him heart and blood like the first one in fifteen days intervals.But their prices were rather high, but Jacob used his merchant skills to get the price to ten thousand gold coins.When he left those shops, he grimaced. He never thought he would need to spend this many gold coins in the uncommon region.Furthermore, the more he observed the goods in the Dark City, the more he felt he was literally living in a village all this time.There were weapon shops that sold innovative weaponry, and even smoke mines and stick grenades were available in these shops. He was now starting to understand where that hob troll got all those weapons.As he entered the central district, his attention was attracted to a ten-story tower that looked like a clock tower.'Potion Tower?' Jacob was curious and headed toward the tower.But two burly guards giving off a scary aura stopped him. "5 Gold Coin Entrance Free."Jacob asked, "What kind of goods do you sell in this place?"If this was before, he might've given 5 gold coins without batty an eye, but now he needed all the money he could get so he won't waste it without any good reason.One of the guards coldly replied with a hint of disdain, "If you don't know about Alchemy Potions, then you might as well not waste your time. I'm afraid this place is too expensive for you."Jacob suddenly thought of something and asked coldly, "Are you implying to those color liquids that can heal or put someone to hibernation?""So, you know about the HR (Hibernate-Rejuvenation) Potions. Yes, we sell those here as well." The guard nodded disdainfully."Good for you." Jacob sneered and turned around, leaving the dumbfounded guards.However, Jacob's expression was grave. 'It seemed I can't go on without a sufficient income source!'This time he didn't take any detour, and after asking around, he finally reached a lavish ten-story building named 'Jerry Pawnshop' and entered!

Chapter 102 Meeting Jerry
﻿Jacob observed the spacious interior of the pawnshop.There were many glass displays, and the items behind them were fairly high-end. He even spotted a scope!"Dear Customer, what kind of services you required?" A petite woman in a silver mask approached Jacob at this moment.Jacob looked at her and coolly stated, "I want to sell a precious iron."The woman's pinkish eyes remained static as she spoke, "Please follow me."She directly led Jacob toward the east wing of the shop and led him inside a bright room. Where a white hair masked figure with pointy ears was sitting behind a work table and examining a small piece of stone with a loupe.The woman approached the white hair person as he had no idea about their arrival. He was too absorbed in whatever he was doing.She said respectfully, "Mr. Observer, can you please apprise this gentleman's item and give up its value?"Mr. Observer finally looked toward them with his green eyes.He coldly said, "You have a minute."She then looked at Jacob. "Please take out the item you want to sell."Jacob didn't delay and pulled out a black brick from his jacket. Which he actually took out from his pendant. He had stored four bricks in his pendant, just in case he had to abandon the bags.But he never thought they would come in handy right now.Mr. Observer's eyes shone with surprise when he saw the black brick and snatched it from Jacob.Jacob didn't mind and stood still while coldly staring at Mr. Observer, who was now examining the black brick with a loupe.The woman seemed to be surprised by Mr. Observer's reaction and looked at the black brick with curiosity.Mr. Observer finally put down his loupe and spoke with a hint of elation, "An 89% pure uncommon titan iron. 25 Gold Coins per gram. What do you think?" Jacob remained stoic on the surface, but he was surprised inwardly, 'It seemed the uncommon region didn't know the true value of this iron. It is two times higher than the price I've in the guild and the agency. But they had very little on sale.'Jacob answered, "30 Gold Coins per gram or no deal." He could tell this Mr. Observer was still holding back.Just as he thought, Mr. Observer didn't reject him outright and started mulling over it.The woman remained silent this whole time. She knew Mr. Observer wasn't someone who would suffer a loss when it came to bargaining.But the titan iron appearance still astounded her because this metal was precious even in the rare regions, and this man had a whole brick that probably weights over 1000 grams.She wondered who this person was and where he came from.Mr. Observer finally spoke, "If you have one more brick, we have a deal." He deeply looked at the amber eye man.Truth be told, he was mulling over what kind of being Jacob was, from his slim and tall visage and his pale white skin. But no such species came into his mind.However, one thing was clear: since Jacob was in the uncommon region and appeared in the Dark City, he wasn't here for a picnic. He was clearly hiding from someone.Nevertheless, they can't act in Dark City because of its rules, and they are not joking because the Dark City is just too strange, and as long as break any of its rules, they are doomed.No matter what you do or where you hide, the enforcers will hunt you down!That's why all these lawless were so lawful in this city, despite their past deeds and background.Jacob nodded impassively. "I have two more. How about 35 gold coins, then?"Mr. Observer's eyes contracted when he heard this, and gritted her teeth, "32 Gold Coins, this is the highest I can go!"Jacob didn't push too hard since he could tell they had reached the limit and nodded. "Deal.""Good, come with me. You can go now." Mr. Observer nodded as he stood up from his seat.The woman nodded and left the room.Jacob saw Mr. Observer moving toward the door in the back, and when he opened it, stairs were revealed.Jacob unhurriedly followed. He wasn't afraid that this old guy would play tricks. He had already noticed just how ethical and licit. This place was when he was coming toward this place.Any shop he visited, they talked business without any hint of deceitful intent, despite their hidden bloodlust. He saw this Dark City in a new light, and he was curious about why those people were so afraid.Besides, if he wanted to kill Jacob for his possession, then there wasn't any need to negotiate so hard with him. Furthermore, this was just an uncommon item, after all.He had long decided he would read the guidebook after dealing with his money problem. As for going toward the rare region, he wasn't in a hurry anymore since this place was far more alluring than the rare region to him right now.Jacob ascended the zigzag staircase with Mr. Observer, and there was only one room at the end of this staircase.Jacob mused they were already on the eighth floor, if not on the ninth.Mr. Observer calmly knocks on the wooden.A husky voice rang. "Enter."With a creek, the door opened, and they both entered.The room was of the same size as the first floor, but there weren't any displays on the wall, but exotic paintings and a comprehensive book shelve.At the center of this floor was a huge rectangular desk with 15 chairs on one side and only a single chair on the other.A person sat on this single chair at this moment without any mask.Jacob's eyes contracted when he saw the appearance of this person.His skin color was purple, and he had long purple hair, light blue astute eyes with slit pupils, a long pointy nose, ears, and a long sharp chin. His mouth was wide, and his sharp canine teeth could be seen.He was probably 2 meters tall, and his body was burly as his muscles showed from his tight black outfit.Jacob quickly summoned the cursed immortality and asked, "Tell me the tiers of these two!"Jacob took this action because he could feel extremely strong pressure from this guy, which he only felt from the mutant.Mr. Observer introduced with respect, "This is the owner of this wonderful establishment, Boss Jerry."Boss Jerry, this gentleman here is selling over 3000-gram titan iron. So, I brought him here to finalize the deal."Jerry's eyes shimmered with a hint of astonishment when he heard this and flashed a smile, showing his beastly teeth as he said, "How delightful. Please take a seat."He pointed toward the seat in front.Jacob nodded as he walked toward the seat, while his focus was on the information on the blank page."Hahaha… that big log is a Purple Hobgoblin from Goblin Race. It's currently at Tier-8, and it's very close to breaking its limit. As for this old fossil, it's a tier-6 white troll without anything special."This place is interesting. If you slaughter just half of them, I promise you won't regret it."Jacob completely ignored the sentence; this book was simply asking him to jump from a cliff. He would be courting death even to try to kill just this rarer bread in the middle of Dark City. He was simply too weak.Likewise, he calmly sat down while Mr. Observer put the black brick in front of Jerry very respectfully."May I know your name? If you don't mind." Jerry picked up the brick and asked politely."Jack." Jacob calmly answered."Jerry!" Jerry nodded before he took out a golden loupe from his drawer and examined the black brick.After examining the black brick for a minute, he finally put it down with an elated glint in his eyes. He asked Jacob, "Mr. Jack, can I check the remaining titan iron?""Why not!" Jacob nodded and put his hand inside his jacket and brought out two more titan iron bricks, and placed it in front of Jerry.Jerry didn't stand on ceremony and quickly examined them as well, and when he was done, he calmly asked, "What's the final deal with Mr. Jack?"Mr. Observer promptly replied, "32 Gold Coins per gram."Jerry thought for a moment before he smiled. "I agree. Go and weigh these three bricks."Mr. Observer nodded, picked up the bricks, and headed toward the other side of the floor to measure their weight.Jerry deeply looked at Jacob and said, "Mr. Jack, if you have more titan iron of the same quality, I want it all. Price is negotiable."Jacob ambiguously answered, "I would love to sell more, but I only acquired these three pieces by chance."Jerry's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. He sighed ruefully, "Is that so? It's a shame, then."'Why are they interested in uncommon titan iron so much?' Jacob was now suspicious!

Chapter 103 True Value
﻿Jacob wasn't a fool. From the moment Mr. Observer reacted after seeing the titan iron and Jerry's sudden excitement, there wasn't gone unnoticed by him.Although he had no idea, why they were so eager to purchase this titan iron, but one thing was clear there was something he doesn't know about titan iron which they did, obliviously.Now, he had to figure out what it was.Furthermore, Jerry clearly had no idea the Earthen Kingdom of Hob Trolls had a reserve of Titan Iron Ore, or with how eager they are, they might've already gone there to take control over that reserve by now.Jacob still has over 120KG Titan Iron of the same quality, and if he could find out why a powerful hobgoblin like Jerry was after, he might reap some unexpected benefits.Mr. Observer came back at this moment and told, "The total weight of the three bricks is 3090 grams. The total amount in gold, 98,880."Jerry merely nodded and flashed a beastly smile at Jacob as he said, "We'll roundabout it to 100,000 Gold Coins. It's also a token of my goodwill, Mr. Jack. If you found more titan iron or any good items, please consider selling to us first."Jacob didn't mind free gold coins right now. He nodded. "It's a deal then, Mr. Jerry."Mr. Observer asked at this moment, "Mr. Jack, would like to transfer this payment to your bank account, or do you want it right now?"Jacob only had two bank accounts, and they were from the uncommon region. They might give away their identity. Furthermore, he wasn't familiar with Zodiac Taurus Bank's rules and regulations since he never bothered to visit the place.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ He didn't know whether or not his information was safe.But now it seemed he had to take a trip to sort out this account as well. He can't carry so many gold coins in person. Since they had a wire transfer system, he might as well make his life easier.However, he required a personal account that wasn't affiliated with any organization. So, he'll have to find a bank branch in Dark City and see if he was eligible to open such an account.He coolly answered, "I need it right now."Jerry nodded and stood up before he left toward a closed door right behind his chair.When he returned, there was a bundle of thick golden bills in his hand.He put the thick bundle right in front of Jacob.Jacob looked at the golden 1,000 bill, marked with the Zodiac Taurus Bank's name and there was a picture of their signature bank building, pantheon, on it.Now, he was in a dilemma because he had no idea if these bills are real or fake since he never encountered them until now.If he asked, Jerry might suspect something, but if he didn't, he might get a swindler of 100,000 gold coins.But when he thought about the rules and regulations of Dark City, he inwardly cussed Jerry before he picked up the bill bundle, which was extremely smooth, as if it was made with sheets of pure gold.He felt more at ease since no one would put this much effort into making a fake paper.Jerry's eyes shimmered a subtle glint when he saw Jacob putting the bundle of bills in his jacket's inner pocket without counting them.This was really a small probe from Jerry because these bills were only available in the bank branches of the rare regions. They were still legit in the Dark City, though.But if Jacob was unfamiliar with them, he really suspected Jacob at that time.Jacob stood up and bid Jerry fair well, and Mr. Observer also left with Jacob.Jerry polity walked to the door and after he confirmed that Jacob and Mr. Observer had left. He locked the door with a stony expression on his face."What do you think?" He questioned while looking at the stone statue on the floor's corner.The white status eyes were like glass, and suddenly, a famine voice transmitted from it, "I can't tell what kind of race he belonged to, but from his skin color he could be a Wolf Halfling or Strange Genasi from Rarer Region."Jerry shook his head. "I beg to disagree. These two races are extremely strong, only second to Mountain Giants. I don't think they would appear in the uncommon region's Dark City. They can easily gain access to the Rarer Region, Dark City. Even I can't enter that place."Even the Dark City in the rare region is extremely hard to enter for people like us, who are wanted by the entire rarer region. That's why we have to run all the way in this shithole just to stay alive."If he was from those two races, he would go to the rare region of Dark City, since that place is a thousand times more resourceful than this, and might find some comrades there from his race."So, he's definitely not from the rarer region, and he doesn't have the qualification to enter that place. I'll be able to deal with him easily. So, forget about he was from the rarer region."The voice sounded again. "Well, you are far more notorious than me, so you know better and you also have a point. I never thought after a decade of staying in hiding we will see a hope to return from this shithole." The voice was filled with emotions.Jerry also chuckled, before his expression turned stern, "But it is still only a hope, not certainty. How much Titan Tears can we extract from 3000-gram of uncommon Titan Iron with 89% purity?"The voice didn't reply for a while, which didn't make Jerry impenitence because he knew that person was checking something.The voice rang again, "With 3000 grams of titan iron of 89% purity, we can only make two Tier-3 Titan Drops and it's barely enough for me to reach A-rank strength."However, if you want to break through again, I required 60 KG of the same quality uncommon titan iron. A minimum of 20 drops of Titan Tears will affect you again. We have already exhausted all the titan iron in the Dark City years ago."While we can't show our traces even in the rare region, they're still on to us, and the rare titan iron is useless for us right now."Besides, we can't take risks. If they found out we are still alive, they will lie in wait outside the uncommon dark city like before. But they won't give up this time like last time, though."Jerry was glum when he heard this. "I know, I know, you don't have to nag me about it. But do you think he had more?""Maybe or maybe not. How about I put a tail on him and see if we might get something?" The voice suggested coldly.Jerry nodded, "But be careful. If he sensed something, we might lose an excellent opportunity. However, if he had more titan iron, then he's doomed!" His voice was laced with killing intent at the end.The voice chuckled, "Heh, I know. Only we know the true value of titan iron. If he showed any strange moments, hehe…"The voice laughed creepily before it stopped.---Jacob had no idea about this conversation between Jerry and the mysterious voice as he was moving toward a pantheon in the central city district, which was the signature building of Zodiac Taurus Bank.Even in the dark city, only the Zodiac Taurus Bank exist while there were no traces of other the Star Mercenary Agency or the two guilds here, and only the bank was allowed.After entering the building, he saw a huge lavish interior with eye-catching marble work, especially eight huge thick pillars of the building and bronze statues standing beside these pillars.Jacob was here to see if those bills were real or not and also to open another private account.He quickly approached an empty counter where a masked woman was sitting and doing some paperwork."Do you have any brochures about the bank in detail?" Jacob questioned impassively.She finally glanced at Jacob and wasn't surprised to see him wearing a cap and mask. She coolly replied, "10 silver Coins for the guideline manual."Jacob put the silver coin in front of her.She took the silver coins and placed a small booklet in front of Jacob. "You can browse through it in the guest area. After you're done, you can come back and tell me what you decided."Jacob nodded and took the booklet before he found an empty seat and opened the booklet.There were many rules and regulations about the privacy and security of the bank, which Jacob had expected, and this put his mind to ease.It was just like any bank, and he didn't have to worry about the bank disclosing his information to others without his concern!

Chapter 104 Zodiac Taurus Bank
 ﻿After browsing through the entire booklet, Jacob got a good idea about the Zodiac Taurus Bank and just scary this bank was.Not only this was the only bank in existence, but they were the only organization that guaranteed the safety of their customers' wealth, and they had never failed in it even once.The most fascinating thing about this bank was its strange banking system.They had only one type of account available, a Personal Account.However, this one account had tiers, the lowest being the G-Tier while the highest being A-Tier.The uncommon region only G-Tier and F-Tier Accounts that only C-Rank Mercenary and B-Rank Mercenary can open them.The G-Tier bank account didn't have any benefits.While the F-Tier and E-Tier had small benefits like if they put more than one million gold coins into their bank accounts, they get 0.5% interest from the bank over every million they deposit.These tiers were the lowest.As for the D-Tier and C-Tier, their interest rate was 1% over a million gold coins, and their transitions will also cost 5% less than the normal rate.As for Tier-B, this account didn't exist in the Rare Region, because anyone who can upgrade their account to this level wasn't someone to trifle with because they were extremely rich.To upgrade a personal bank account, one required a deposit of 10,000 Gold Coins and they will get a G-Tier Account.To upgrade to F from G, it was quite simple; the balance had to be over 1 million Gold Coins, and if the amount dropped from 1 million for a certain period of time, the bank account will then be downgraded to G-Tier again.The E-Tier upgrade limit was 50 Million, while the D-Tier upgrade limit was 100 million, and the C-Tier upgrade limit was 500 million gold coins!As for the B-Tier, there were two conditions to upgrade the personal account to this tier. First, the balance had to be over 1 Billion Gold Coins, and second, and most important; the owner needed a special recommendation from the Rarer Region.As for what kind of recommendation and from where exactly, it wasn't mentioned, but Jacob could tell it would not be just a random place. He can only know about this recommendation information when he would be eligible for this tier, not before.He wasn't even eligible for an F-Tier account, much less a B-Tier.After knowing the strength of this bank, he wasn't worried about anything anymore. Even the Dark City had no choice but to give the Zodiac Taurus Bank way in their city, this show just how strong its grip was over the currency and economy.Jacob approached the attendant again and said, "I want to open G-Tier Account."The masked attended didn't show any emotion and nodded. "Do you have any accounts in your name with another organization?"Jacob's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. "Does it matter?""Yes, if you're a C, B, or A rank mercenary or a high-level member of some guild, you are probably registered within our database through your name and DNA."Supposed if you're a C-rank mercenary and a Basic Apothecary, then you'll have two accounts to your name provided by both organizations."However, in our database, those two accounts don't exist, but only a Personal Account with different Private Transfer Codes. You also don't have to deposit 10,000 Gold Coin as well."Simply put, you can only have one Personal Account but different Private Transfer Codes. They all lead to your Personal Account."However, these Private Transfer Codes will only generate if you're registered with a powerful organization, like our mercenary agency or guilds of the Alchemy Guild."They all have their unique Transfer Codes, and every member will get one when they registered in their database for the first time."Jacob was astonished since he had no idea about this. He confusingly asked, "Then where is my Personal Account?"The masked attended chuckled at this moment, "It seemed you never visited the bank after receiving your bank account information from the organization, right?"Jacob was lost for words, since it was true since she was talking about it without any shock this mean this wasn't a new case. So, he told the truth, "Something like that.""Then that explains why you didn't know about your personal account details. So, do you want to complete the process now? Since you already have a personal account, you just need to complete the process." The attendant questioned.Jacob thought for a moment before he said, "I don't have my Guild or Mercenary IDs with me, but I knew my Private Transfer Code. Does it work?"He didn't want to show his uncommon region IDs. and if she can't see them, she would never know he was from the uncommon region.As for using Decker's ID, he might've already had such an account, but he wasn't sure if he can gain access to it without any knowledge about its account number or identification.The masked woman nodded. "I only need those to track your personal account."Jacob was relieved and told her about his mercenary Private Transfer Code.Soon, she took out a tab-size device and inserted the Private Transfer Code, and when she entered it, details appeared.She looked at Jacob with astonishment, "So, you really were affiliated with two organizations, huh? Quite rare for someone like to be here."Jacob remained impassive since she only found out about his affiliation, not about from which region of affiliation."We all have our reasons." He coolly replied now he was completely at ease.She nodded before she pressed a button and a scanner interface appeared on the screen. "I need both of your hand prints to complete the process."Jacob didn't mind and put his hand on the scanner one by one, and after she was satisfied, she quickly complete the last process.She then again handed the device to Jacob and said, "Write down the passcode. Keep in mind, if you forget, you need to pay 10,000 Gold Coin to reset it again from our branches, and you need to be there personally."Jacob nodded and quickly jolted down a complex passcode that appeared *********** on the screen and handed it over again.Afterward, the process went smoothly, and she jolted down something on the paper and then handed it to Jacob."This is your Personal Account Number and Personal Transfer Code. The difference between this Personal Transfer Code and the other Private Transfer Codes is you will receive your payment directly without having it processed from any organization's database." She handed Jacob the paper with two complex numbers.Jacob glanced at it and remembered them instantly."How much balance do I have?" He asked while storing that paper away.She looked at the screen and said, "After deducting 100 Gold Coins processing fee, 2,090 Gold Coins."Jacob nodded since he had expected it. He then took out the bill bundle, which startled the attendant.Jacob noticed her eyes contracted when she saw the bills, so he knew they were real.He then gave her ten bills and said, "Deposit them into my account." As he put away the remaining 90 thousand in his pocket again.She received them and carefully counted them before she used the device to update Jacob's account balance."It's done. Anything else?" She asked with a slightly gentle tone this time.She knew anyone who possessed these bills in the uncommon region wasn't some random tom, dick, or harry.Jacob thought for a moment before he took out Decker's ID card and said, "I want to know if this ID had an account register with it.""You can't have that information as long as it's not your ID," she stated matter-of-factly."And how do I prove this is my ID card?" Jacob asked unhurriedly."To make sure no one gains access to the client's personal information and their assets if anyone wants account information on IDs, they had to scan their fingerprints first and pay a scanning fee."If those fingerprints matched the ones within our database, only then we can give you the information on the aforementioned ID card." She pliantly explained.This kind of thing was quite normal when some enemy got their hands on some IDs of their targets, and they came straight to the bank to gain information on it.So, to prevent this from happening, the Bank had a very strict policy about it.No one can gain an account owner's personal information or bank account information without proving they were the actual owner.Jacob wasn't frustrated by this, on the contrary, he was happy. Because it would be a massive letdown if he had gained access to Decker's account information just by his ID card.That would've also meant his information wasn't safe either.Now that he was satisfied, he suddenly remembered something and questioned, "How can I send money or know when I received it through a bank transfer?"She suddenly opened a drawer and put a phone size device in front of Jacob and said, "You have to buy this Zodiac Money Transfer Device from the Bank. It cost 20,000 Gold Coins and then registered with your bank account. Do you want it?"

﻿Jacob left the bank building after he was done with his bank account matter and his concerns.In the end, he even bought that Zodiac Money Transfer Device for twenty thousand gold coins, since it could come in handy frequently.Furthermore, he now had a deeper understanding of Zodiac Taurus Bank and how advanced the Rare Region was compared to the Uncommon Region, despite still being in the uncommon region.Afterward, Jacob decided to visit that Potion Tower before calling it a day.When he reached the Potion Tower, those two burly guards' eyes narrowed. They instantly recognized Jacob from his getup, who 'mocked' them early.However, before they could berate him and chase him away, Jacob showed them five gold coins, "I want in.""Go." Unwillingly, they took the coins and let him pass.They didn't want to cause a scene without any good reason. Since Jacob was paying the entrance fee, they can't stop him or they will suffer terribly.Jacob merely smirked. He knew these people can't break the Dark City rules. They simply weren't willing to. So, as long as he doesn't give them a reason, they can't do anything to him.The interior of this Potion Tower was made with white wood, which was gleaming like marble. He saw medical equipment on display, dry plants, herbs, and especially those colored liquids stored in all sizes of flasks.Most of the equipment he had already seen in Dereck's lab, and he also remembered some unique equipment of this world from Decker's journal and also memorized the Advance Herbology of Rare and Rarer Plants & Plant Lore.He was probably as knowledgeable as an Advance Apothecary even higher.But he had no idea about liquids in flasks."How may I help you today?" A high-pitched voice rang at this moment.Jacob turned around and then looked down. He saw a 2 feet tall person wearing a white mask with a large nose.'What kind of creature is this?' He was astonished when he saw those long ears, and almost a feet long nose, and small limbs.The little guy seemed to sense something as his emerald eyes narrowed. "Are you mocking me in your heart because of my height?"Jacob found it funny as he said, "And why do you think that?""I can tell since you didn't reply to me! Brat, if you call me short, I'll throw you out!" He suddenly threatened Jacob without any good reason.Jacob coldly said, "Don't put words in my mouth. It's you being rude by calling me a brat. I'm here to buy some supplies. Why do I care about anyone's height? Now tell me, do you have any introduction manual for those potions?" The little guy narrowed his eyes in suspicion, but since Jacob didn't call him short and he answered, "We have five types of alchemy potions available for sale,"The Green Potion or the Hibernate-Rejuvenation (HR) Potions. Each newly filled Glass Cell can sustain hunger or slowly heal deep wounds both external and internal while it can put anyone under a deep hibernating state for a minimum of 2 years. It depends on who is using it and how strong or weak its body is. It cost 5,000 gold coins per liter."The Blue Potion or the Fasting Potion. Each newly filled Glass Cell can sustain huger for a minimum of 30 days. It cost 500 gold coins per liter."Then Yellow Potion or the Healing Potion. Each flask can heal external and internal injuries within a few minutes. One flask will cost 10,000 gold coins. One drop is recommended for the common specie, a half flask is recommended for uncommon and an entire flask is recommended for a rare species."The Purple Potion or the Detox Potion. It can cure 100 kinds of rare poisons and illnesses. One flask will cost 10,000 gold coins."Lastly, the Black Potion or the Haste Recovery Potion. It had both Fasting Potion and Healing Potion's qualities, but it's twenty times more potent than both of them combine. It also can cure any kind of uncommon poison and illness. One flask will cost you 25,000 Gold coins."We also have special painkiller pills, five-time recover gauze, healing cream…"Jacob frowned as the little guy kept going on and on as if he was possessed."Alright stop."Only now the little guy stopped his passionate introduction and looked at Jacob. "Now, what do you want?"Jacob wonder just who hired this annoying idiot, and he was now feeling extremely perplexed because after he heard those potions' prices, he instantly thought about those filled tanks in Decker's hideout.Especially the tank with Haste Recovery Potion. He felt his heart bleeding. There were probably two or three barrels worth of that potion in there, and it was all lost!In the end, Jacob only bought five new metal syringes, some painkillers, healing cream, and some gauze, spending 2 thousand gold coins, and left the Potion Tower.Those potions had little use, and he already had the four or five flasks worth of black potion, so he didn't want to spend his gold coins on those other potions.He then checked in to an inn for two days, and after he was done, he skimmed through the small guidebook he bought at the entry gate.He was astonished as he read because the Dark City wasn't like other cities.It wasn't a part of any nation, country, kingdom, or empire, but it was a neutral city, which was even scarier than any aforementioned establishments.Because in every region there was only a single Dark City and it didn't exist in any nation's territories, but in the most dangerous zones of that region!Furthermore, every Dark City had its unique entrance qualifications and without possessing those qualifications, even a nation's leader can't enter a Dark City.Not only that, but the Organization behind the Dark City was completely unknown, and no one knows who they were. Even the three hegemonies never comment on this mystery.That's what made the Dark Cities truly unfathomable, and no one tried to break any laws of Dark Cities.For anyone who did, the result was within a signal night, the offenders with their families, clans, tribes, or even their nations vanished from the face of this world without anyone knowing how!This Dark City Jacob was in, was called the Uncommon Dark City, and only rare species can enter this place.As for the Rare Dark City in the Rare Region, there wasn't any map or any details about that place.If someone wanted to enter that place, they first have to find it before knowing what the entrance conditions were.What truly drew Jacob's attention was the Independent Noble Systems of Dark Cities.There were Dark Noble Ranks, divided into Lower Dark Noble, Upper Dark Noble, Dark Baron, Dark Viscount, Dark Earl, Dark Marquise, and Dark Duke.These ranks can be earned by doing Dark Missions issued by the City Admin Manor.Every Dark Noble Rank gave special advantages and privileges in the Dark City. Such as an Upper Dark Noble didn't require paying to stay in the Uncommon Dark City, the other privileges weren't written.However, just becoming a Lower Dark Noble was almost impossible to even in Uncommon Dark City because Dark Missions weren't available 24/7 like a mercenary guild.But every Dark City only issued a Single Dark Mission every year and anyone can accept them and whoever completes it first will earn the corresponding rewards.Furthermore, these dark missions had timelines for a single year until the next dark mission was issued. If someone completes a Dark Mission even a day above the last day, it would be voided.That's why earrings a Dark Noble Rank of Dark Cities were so much difficult and everyone fought tooth and nail for these missions.Most of the time, these competitors end up canceling each other from completing these missions or getting in each other's way, which results in mission failure.Jacob couldn't help but scoffed in the end, when he finished reading the small booklet. He was naturally curious about the background of these Dark Cities and how they were controlling powerful people to do labor for them.But he was also interested in these dark noble ranks since it would save him a huge amount of money.However, he won't be going to be distracted by these small benefits when he can earn a huge amount of gold by himself as long as he put his skills to use.But he didn't have time for this because he was waiting for the heart and blood of the rare species, which would come in two days.He would buy those hearts and blood and all the rare meat he could before he'll leave the dark city to find a remote place to start his injection process.Although the Dark City was completely safe, it was monitored.Even if there was a remote possibility that someone might notice his special constitution. He wasn't willing to take that risk.So, leaving the Dark City and then coming back after he was done would be his best choice. Or if he thought the Uncommon Dark City wasn't enough for him anymore, he might leave for the rare region without coming back.He required a large amount of rare meat to sustain his hunger, and if he tried to buy all that meat from the Dark City; he required millions of gold coins which he didn't have, nor he was willing to pay.Because he can hunt them himself as long as he knew where they were, and this was much faster this way. Especially after breaking the 20% limit or 30% even.He hasn't forgotten his realistic goal, which was immortality. Nothing else was more alluring than this to him!

Chapter 106 Being Followed!
﻿Two days later,Jacob had a pleasant lunch in his room before he left toward the butcher shops he had visited on the first day and ordered Rare Heart and Blood.When he was a few meters away from the first butcher shop, 'Cursed Immortality!'He summoned Immortika and told sternly, "I knew you know what is going on, but still, I'm going to tell you one more time. Soon when he showed me heart and blood, I want to know their tiers and if they are good for distillation or not."Jacob was so confident in appraising those hearts and blood, was naturally because of Immortika, and he knew nothing can escape this book's detection.Furthermore, he only has half an hour to finalize all the deals before his time of summoning Immortika runs out for the day."Hehehe, why don't you just kill all the surrounding livestock? This place is probably a poultry farm for you!" Immortika recommended.Jacob retorted coldly, "I'd love to, but I don't want to be ripped apart by the owner of this farm. So, keep your obscene suggestions to yourself. We have work to do.""Then just draw some chickens out of this farm. It's so easy. Why are you being a coward?"Jacob ostensibly replied, "We'll cross that bridge when the time comes. First, I need to absorb all the heart essence I'm about to get, and if I find myself short on meat. I'll do as you suggest."It wasn't like he hadn't thought of this, it was just that he didn't require taking such actions right now.Jacob entered the butcher shop, and he saw the masked man skinning some uncommon animals while the burly butcher he was familiar with sat in his chair.When the masked butcher saw Jacob's appearance, his eyes flashed as he said, "So, you come."Jacob didn't beat around the bush and said, "I'm in a hurry. Do you have it or not?""Wait here." The butcher didn't mind and put his book down as he stood up and entered the back door."That's a tier-6 Brown Troll. Don't you want his heart and blood?" Immortika wrote words of temptation.Jacob merely scoffed and didn't indulge it anymore.Soon the Brown Troll came back with a jar filled with blood and the heart was also floating within."Now tell me that thing tier and if it's good for distillation?" Jacob questioned."Tier-4 Gray Horn Hog. Although it was slaughtered 4 hours ago, it's still good for distillation. But it's nothing in front of that big log."Jacob pretended as if he didn't even see the last words."Your heart and blood." The Brown Troll put the jar in front of Jacob while observing his eyes.Although he didn't know why Jacob wanted this heart and blood, he didn't have the right to ask. But he was curious about how Jacob would tell if this was indeed the blood and heart of a rare species.To his surprise; Jacob didn't even open the jar and put ten thousand gold bills on the counter and said, "It's indeed what I asked for."The Brown Troll was baffled because he thought Jacob would take out some kind of device or taste the blood or at least open the jar to smell it, but he didn't do any of this.Jacob put the jar in the large bag he had prepared beforehand.He looked at the Brown Troll and asked, "Can you arrange another heart and blood except for Gray Horn Hog next time?""YOU?! How do you know?" The Brown Troll's eyes went wide in shock.Jacob deliberately revealed it so he could intimidate the other party. and he also wanted to be sure the next delivery would be different from the Gray Horn Hog.Now that the butcher knew he can tell where this blood and heart come from just by a glance, he won't dare to underestimate him."Can you arrange it or not?" Jacob completely ignored his question and impassively questioned again.The Brown Troll took a deep breath before he shook his head. "My supplier only raised Gray Horn Hogs."'That's what I think so.' Jacob didn't have his hopes up from the start. "Then you don't need to arrange the heart and blood any more. Thanks."Done saying he left the bewildered Brown Troll and his shop.Jacob quickly approached the second butcher shop, which was five hundred meters away from the Brown Troll's shop.The butcher also prepared a jar for Jacob."Hahaha… this is also a heart and blood of tier-4 Gray Horn Hog. It seemed your dream of collecting heart and blood without getting your hands dirty might not last for even a day."Jacob's expression fell when he saw that and thought grimly, 'Do they all have the same supplier?'"I don't want this heart and blood!" He plainly declared.The butcher, who was a gnome, turned hostile hearing this and rebuked. "Who do you mean you don't want it? Are you messing with me? Do you know how difficult it was to arrange your bullshit blood and heart?"Jacob knew if it was anyone else, they would also fly in rage, but he had no use for this heart and blood any more.He said, "I know I'm the one at fault here. So, I buy 15 thousand gold coins worth of rare meat from you. How's that sound?""Then what about this heart and blood?" Although the gnome was still furious, he didn't try to jump on Jacob anymore, since fifteen thousand gold coins weren't a small amount."You can think of a way yourself. Now, do we have a deal or not?" Jacob coldly questioned.Since it was his fault, he was willing to buy meat from here, but if this guy think he can push him around, then he was dead wrong. If he still threw his little tantrum, he would leave and see if this guy dared to attack him.Furthermore, he can tell these guys didn't have to spend 10,000 gold coins on a measly heart and a liter of blood.In the end, the gnome had no choice but to agree because he could sense Jacob would leave if he tried to play the victim anymore.Jacob left the shop with fifteen pounds of rare meat.He then headed toward the third shop, which turned out to be a letdown as well with the same type of blood and heart again. He again settled this matter with fifteen pounds of rare meat.Without much expectation, he entered the fourth shop, which turned out to be the same as the previous two.Now, he had 45 pounds of meat, and he headed toward the last shop. His hopes were completely extinguished now and he would buy 15 pounds of rare meat more before leaving the city.60 pounds of meat was enough to sustain his hunger until he found rare prey, and he was even thinking about going to the rare region without coming back to the dark city anymore.Although this place was great and all, his needs lay in the rare region where he can hunt as many rare species as he wanted.As for killing the people in Dark City, it was a very time-consuming process. Because most of them were criminals. They were just refugees in Uncommon Dark City, and there wasn't anywhere worth going in the uncommon region as well.So, these people seldom leave the dark city and mostly worked there since there was almost everything available there.Just as Jacob predicted, the last shop also turned out to have the same meat supplier. Now, Jacob wondered who this supplier was and where his farm was.If it was something in the uncommon region, he didn't mind plundering it.However, even the shop owners didn't know who it was since they only had business deals through his attendants. So, this was also another dead end.Jacob didn't waste any more time on other butcher shops and visited some weapon shops on his way.Now, he had spent all the money he earned from selling the titan iron except the ten thousand in his bank account. So, he left toward the exit.The gate guards didn't block his way, but they were somewhat astonished since someone leaving the Dark City was a rare sight in Uncommon Dark City.The rude gate attendant only asked for Jacob's pass back without saying a word about refunds for his remaining days.Jacob coldly glanced at her before he left through the gate.However, just as Jacob left, another capped person left soon after, and Jacob didn't even notice this person!His mysterious person stealthily followed Jacob's tracks since it was in the middle of the day; he quickly spotted Jacob going toward the border river.'Is he leaving?' The capped person thought while continuing to follow Jacob, while Jacob had no idea about it.He was going toward the area where he buried his two bags!

Chapter 107 Mutant Heart Essence!
﻿The strange thing about this person was while he was moving, there wasn't any sound of breathing or his movement on the ground. His heartbeat was almost none exist!'What a strange breed. First, he goes to the bank and then to Potion Town before he locked himself in the inn for two days. Now, he bought so much meat and exited the city. Just what the hell is he doing, and why did I even mission to follow this oddity?' The stalker thought in vexation.However, when they were just a few hundred meters away from the river, he saw Jacob suddenly start to dig between trees, and thereupon he noticed Jacob taking out two large bags from the ground!His gray eyes dilated with a hint of astonishment, 'So, he has something to hide! Could it be that; he's one of those thieves who robbed some prominent clans and then escaped here with treasures? 'It has to be the case, and the geezer just happened to notice it, and that's why he told me to tail him and report if he has done anything suspicious.'However, if he really has stolen wealth that can even incite that cynicism geezer, then I should consider my option more carefully. I'm not a wanted criminal like him. If I had wealth, I might be able to pay my way out of that mess. Which also means I can return from this shithole!' His purple eyes shone with ambivalence.He knew double-crossing his current boss would be hazardous, but he didn't want to stay here forever.'First, I'll kill that guy and take his things, and if there's really something worth risking my position in this shithole, then I should take that risk. But if I got nothing worth buying my freedom, then I'll take it back.'Besides, that geezer can't tell if he was killed by me or some random beast or I can simply say he was leaving and I had no choice but take action.' His purple eyes suddenly flashed with killing intent, 'That guy seemed weak. This should be easy. I just had to strike when he least expected it!'Jacob had no idea that he was being shadowed right now. and the other person had already decided to kill him for his treasures.While healing four large bags, he still moved swiftly deep into the mountains.'How can he move so fast while carrying those large bags? He can't be an agility type, right?' The stalker wondered, as he was now more careful of Jacob and didn't dare to underestimate him.As they moved deeper and deeper into the mountains, the stalker became warier before a hint of shock surfaced in his eyes. 'He had stamina and agility? He can't be from the rarer region, right?'He suddenly has second thoughts about attacking Jacob now. Furthermore, he was extremely careful and sneaky, and he survived to this day because of his astute mind.Although Jacob looked weak, he had shown agility and stamina, which only a top-tier species of the rare region can have. Or someone from the rarer region.Although he was strong and can kill rare species with his sneaky abilities, even he dreads those peak races of the rare region and any species of the rarer region.Jacob moved for an entire day before he found an empty cave beside a small pond. After scouting the area, he decided to remain here until he was done absorbing the heart essences.Furthermore, he can also practice his water meditation. He was very close to two hours mark, and he hadn't practiced it ever since he left the lionheart city.Just to make sure no one intruded or some strange animal or beast attacked him while he was absorbing the heart essence, he found a large boulder to cover the mouth of the cave.After he was done blocking the entrance, he calmly sat bare chest. He took out the heart essence of the mutant!He decided to absorb this essence first because according to Immortika, the chance of awakening an ability was much higher with this mutant's heart essence.Secondly, he didn't want to cross the thirty percent limit without having his body completely acclimated to twenty percent. He didn't know he would even survive that kind of hunger or simply blow himself up by eating.After taking a deep breath, he pierced his chest with a newly filled injection.The moment the mutant's heart essence entered his heart, Jacob's entire body quivered before he felt like lave has entered his bloodstream. Black vines started to appear on his entire body, and he felt like he would explode at any moment.This pain was far worse than he had felt before as his heart was beating like an engine, and his blood circulated at a crazy speed.The vague dark mark inside his heart was now suddenly gleaming in red as it suddenly started to become apparent.Jacob could feel something rising within him like a raging tide, and he was very close to losing his conciseness because of the sheer pain and temperature he was feeling."Don't lose consciousness. You're awakening an ability. If you lose consciousness, you'll regret it. hahahaha…"An eerie voice reverberated in his head, which was none other than Immortika's!He can never forget that eerie, overlapping voice.Although he didn't know how it could speak right now. He didn't have time to mull over it because he now had to do everything to stay awake.He even bit his tongue to not fall unconscious while he had to endure the feeling of his heart being slowly ripped apart.Outside,The starker didn't have any idea Jacob was in his most vulnerable state as he looked at the closed save with complicated emotions.He had long thrown the idea of attacking Jacob after he saw him lifting that over thousand KG boulder like it was nothing. He now felt extremely glad that he didn't attack Jacob or he might don't have a life to regret it right now.Now, he understood why he was only given the mission to just tail him, but not act against him.'Well, geezer, I'll report about treasure and his location. But I won't tell you about his strength. If you two battle, you'll probably destroy each other, and then I can easily reap huge benefits.' His scheming eyes shone with coldness, 'But I have to make sure that geezer leaves his cave, or if he didn't come, it would be for nothing, and he might sense something and turn hostile to me.'With that in mind, he took out a small divide. If Jacob were here, he would instantly recognize this because it was a pager.'Fuck, there is no single in this shithole. I have to be close to the Dark City to use it. Well, since he put such a huge bolder around that cave. He won't leave anytime soon, and it would be easier to draw the geezer out if I sound desperate and led him here!' After taking another glimpse, he left quickly toward the dark city.He was over eighty miles away and it would take him two days to come back with help if things go smoothly.Inside the cave,Jacob was groaning and whimpering on the ground as he was on the verge of going insane with that extreme pain running amok in his entire being.His entire body was in the shade of deep red as his cutaneous veins could be seen clearly, while traces of black blood were on his orifices.The dark mark inside his heart was now quite apparent, as it was covered in a dark sheen at this moment. It was the symbol of infinity (∞) as his infinity pendant.Furthermore, the gap between this infinity symbol wasn't empty, but they were still quite hazy to see for the moment.Suddenly, dark roots started to spread from this infinity symbol before they covered the entirety of Jacob's heart, making it pitch black.Outside, Jacob suddenly felt like something just exploded in his heart, and all of a sudden it stopped beating!No matter how strong will Jacob was, he can't stay awake while his heart got stopped suddenly, while he was mentally and physically tortured and exhausted.His eyes rolled upward, and he fell to the ground without breathing.Half an hour passed since Jacob's heart stopped, and he was virtually dead.Suddenly, the darkness covering his heart started to disappear before only the vague infinity mark was left.His heart suddenly trembled before it beat unexpectedly, and slowly it started to beat in a particular rhythm while a strange chill was released in Jacob's body. He started breathing again, but he was still unconscious.At this time, a white book appeared from thin air as it hovered on top of Jacob.Immortika's eerie voice sounded at this moment, filled with delight. "Hahahaha… I don't know if he's lucky to awake this ability or unlucky. At least I won't be bored anytime soon… hahaha…"

Chapter 108 A Dangerous Ability!
﻿"Child, you seemed lost." A benevolent voice said to a young man with tattered clothes and his face filled with bruises and scars sitting on a clean staircase, panting.The young man looked behind and saw a smiling old priest, and then he noticed the building behind him. It was a temple."I'll leave." Said the young man in his weak yet cold voice as he tried to stand, but failed. Because of his exhausted state, he grumbled because of the pain he felt from the wounds."I didn't mean to chase you away. You're in the temple of god, and he would never chase away pitiful." The priest replied as he moved toward the young man to support him.But the young man didn't let the old priest approach him, and with great difficulty, stood up. "I'm not pitiful, nor do I believe in any god."Finished saying, the young man tried to walk away, but just as he took a step he lost his balance and fell to the ground, groaning in pain.Suddenly, he felt a skinny yet firm hand struggle to l him up."Young man, we all are pitiful to be born in this world of trials." The priest softly said as he lifted the young man."You didn't need to be a believer until you find it in your heart, nor did I ask you to believe." The priest smiled as he strongly held the young man. "I just want to help you. There's no other reason. Now, let's go inside. It's going to be a rainy night."The young man looked at the Priest with a hint of disbelief and shame, but he didn't reject the help anymore as he slowly walked toward the temple entrance with a slight warmth in his stone-cold heart…---'Rumbled…'The sound of thunder rumbling rang in the rainy mountain ranges as the dark clouds covered the sky…At this moment,'Aghhh…'Suddenly, a powerful groan reverberated in the silent cavern as Jacob's fingers start twitching.With dizziness, Jacob pulled himself off the dirty floor.'I… I'm still… alive?' He was bewildered as see the same surrounding.A complicated glint flashed past his eyes. 'Why do I dream of that Senile Old Man? I even saw his annoying smiling face clearly, which I had almost forgotten in all these years.'A melancholic sigh escaped his mouth as he mumbled, "It's been a long time, hasn't it… Pops?"However, before Jacob could indulge in the past, his stomach rumbled loudly.Jacob's expression was horrified because he felt a sudden hunger of the same level as he felt the very first time, or even worse.Without having any time to think, he quickly dashed toward the bags, which were filled with slabs of rare meats.Although he doesn't know how long he has been unconscious, he heard the rare meat won't go rotten for five or six days even if you didn't preserve it.The meat was really fine, but even if it wasn't, Jacob wouldn't care about it since he was feeling goosebumps as his hunger kept rising without any sign of stopping. If he didn't eat anything, he might really die!Without caring about if it was uncooked, he started eating it raw, and to his surprise, his teeth were biting this hard meat like it was tofu. He understood he had again because strong, far stronger than he was before.So, he ate even faster.As he consumed the meat, it instantly turned into warm yet cold energy as he visually felt this energy spreading in his whole body at an alarming rate. His digestive system was working twenty times faster than before he ate the entire tiger bull.Furthermore, as he ate, he didn't see any kind of change in his muscle mass like the last time. He wasn't even masculine anymore, but skinny.In fifteen minutes, Jacob had consumed all the rare meat he had bought with him here, and to his horror, it was only enough to help him not go crazy. But he had this feeling that it won't last long before it would return.But for now, he wasn't hungry enough to not even think straight. As for how long it lasted, he didn't want to find out and was ready to hunt anything out there!However, first, he had some doubts which can be only answered by a certain book."Cursed Immortality!" He menacingly uttered.Jacob first glanced at his progress, and his eyes contracted when he saw the percentage._______…-Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark-Completion: 30.01%…_______"How the fuck did this happen? Explain!" Jacob couldn't help but gnashed his teeth.He didn't take the gnome's heart essence before the mutant's for exactly this reason. He didn't want to cross two limits at the same time, but somehow it happened.Furthermore, he was misguided about this as well. Immortika only told him a matured mutant would probably provide a 10% increase in his completion rate. But it provided over 12%, and now he was suffering the consequences.If he had a vast reserve of rare meat, he didn't mind. But he didn't, and he was still in the uncommon region, which put him into a very perilous situation.And it was all because that damn book told him it would be fine and he would even awake an ability which he literally died awakening, and he knew he had failed!Immortika wrote, "What are you yelling about? I never told you the exact percentage the mutant heart will provide. Besides, you should've thought that you also had a mutant heart."This means the final result of this injection was also random. But I had to say it went pretty well for you. Not only you got a huge percentage because of your mutant heart, but you also successfully awakened an innate ability."Jacob, who was about to lose his temper because of Immortika's nonchalant bullshit, was instantly startled when he read the last part."I awake an innate ability?" Jacob quickly asked, completely forgetting about his previous resentment, "But you said… wait, why did you speak at that time but not now?"It was also what he was most mad about. Immortika had told him the strict rules of their communication, but those rules also seemed to be a façade."Hehehe… I'm still bound by the rules, but do you know all the rules?" Immortika questioned.Jacob frowned. He really didn't know all the rules because he only knew what Immortika revealed.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "Don't become suspicious of me. I'm bound to you. Do you think I'll harm you and then wait in some damn place for hundreds or thousands of years again until some other inheritor appeared?"Let me tell you, I could speak at that time because just like you can summon me, I can also summon myself as well. However, unlike you, the time limit is only one minute and the cooldown period is one year."I can freely speak in your mind if I summon myself, and you don't need to about this since this was irrelevant to you. Now that you know, what can you do about it? ahahahah…"Jacob felt more at ease when he heard this, but his expression darkened when he saw that mocking laugh. He knew this detail was irrelevant to him, and he had no use for such information besides knowing that this annoying book had such a capability.Not wanting to continue this topic after getting a satisfactory answer, he quickly returned to the main topic, "What about that innate ability you spoke of? What is it!""Since this question is related to your progress, I'll answer it. Hehehe… do you know how your heart mutated?" It didn't answer but posse a question instead.Jacob rolled his eyes at the first line, but he didn't really know about the answer to the latter. "Why are you playing riddles? Just tell me.""Remember that little gray bug which never left your heart that day?"Jacob's eyes narrowed with a hint of fear. How could he forget about the Bloodstorming Bug that bastard used to test his heart that day?"It was because of Bloodstorming Bug?" He questioned in astonishment."Hehe, exactly. That bug died after taking a few bites off your heart because you were already on the verge of creating the immortal mark at that time, and its carcass was left there before it melted into your heart when the immortal mark was formed."Jacob suddenly had a terrible feeling about this. "Don't tell me?""Hahaha… you awaken that bug's Fluid Acceleration ability, which is extremely hard to control. You can say your heart is now an accelerator that can accelerate your blood at an extremely high speed."Although this ability is quite useful for many reasons, as long as you can control it. But it's much more difficult said than done. To control it, you have to learn how to control your heart rate, which can now increase infinitely as you grow stronger and stronger!"Because if you can't, your heart will blow up your entire body before blowing itself!"

Chapter 109 Prey Or Hunter? (1)
﻿Jacob's expression was ashen when he read about this ability because it was more like a suicidal ability than helpful."How would I know it has activated or not?" Jacob asked quickly because he suddenly felt like something was extremely wrong."Hahahaha… didn't I tell you it's your heartbeat? It's the key to Fluid Acceleration. If you want to activate it, your heartbeat rate should be around 10 heartbeats per second (BPS)."Let's call 1X Acceleration. However, it's where your real problem lies because once you enter 1X acceleration, you'll have to learn how to keep it that way. Because it would only increase, not decrease."Right now, your current heart can handle 3X Acceleration or 4X for a few seconds. As for your body, it would explode at 2X because it is still not balanced with your heart's progress yet."Not only do you have to learn how to maintain the exact acceleration speed and control it, but you have to learn how to reduce it as well because once it started, it won't reduce on its own."You're not like those bugs that can only use fluid acceleration on others and didn't care about stopping it afterward, nor they can. But your plight is you can start it on yourself and have to learn how to stop it!"Jacob smiled wryly when he read this. He had to admit this ability was as useful as it was dangerous.Because with this fluid acceleration, he can make his blood circulation at an extremely high right, and blood circulation fueled the human body.If Jacob can accelerate it at will. Not only will it increase his sensory reactions, and physical performance, it can help to heal his wounds faster, it can make his brain sharper and his senses extremely high, and it can help him digest nutrition at an alarming rate.However, this was also a double-edged sword, just as Immortika disclosed. If he accelerates his blood circulation over his heart and body limit, he would really explode.But this wasn't the only danger. He would burn his body energy extremely fast, which means he is required to keep a high energy source ready all the time.But first, he had to learn how to decrease and increase his heart rate like breathing, but he was afraid to activate it and then not be able to handle it.While he can't just let it as it is as well because if he didn't learn how to control his heart rate, he might accidentally activate it when he experiences some perilous situation, and he knew he will.This world wasn't peaceful, and he also required strength to achieve immortality, so it was only a pipe dream if he thought he can achieve it without experiencing any dangerous situations."I guess you don't have any excellent suggestions to master this fluid acceleration, do you?" Jacob inquired with narrowed eyes.Although he still resents Immortika, he knew when it comes to knowledge; it was the only thing he could count on."Hehe, I can't answer that." Immortika playfully rejected.Jacob pulled a long face, but he knew the information about the fluid acceleration was the only thing he would get from Immortika. So, he didn't waste his breath on persuading it, since it was meaningless."But… you'll find it on your own. I have faith… hahaha…"Jacob's eyes shimmered when he read this subtle line. But before he could mull over it, he suddenly heard footsteps outside the cave entrance.He only noticed that his hearing had become even stronger than before. Although those footsteps weren't exactly outside the cave, they were closing in, and quickly at that.'Are they coming for me or simply passerby?' Jacob mused."What are the tiers of those people?" Jacob quickly asked Immortika with a hint of anticipation and killing intent.The Dark City was only a couple of miles away from this area. If they're some rare species, he didn't mind killing them. He direly needed nutrition right now, as his hunger was nowhere near sustainable.Since those guys delivered themselves, he didn't mind eating them and collecting more hearts and blood in the process."Oh… hahahahaha… you won't believe it. There's three of them you even know between these prey, and one of them is even your old acquainted…"When Jacob read the entire writing, he was astonished before a murderous glint flashed past his rancor eyes.'So, that's how it is, huh? I never thought they'll send someone after me, and I even failed to notice it. But to think it that motherfucker again. Well, since they're courting death, I don't mind harvesting some high-quality meat and collecting some debt in the process as well.' Jacob's lips rose into an icy smile.If they came before the absorption of the mutant's heart, he might've decided to run, but now he was confident in handling them. They simply prey for him right now, not enemies.Although Jacob looks skinny right now, he was laden with power, and as long as he didn't go overboard, his body would not break, and his heart rate will remain under the 1X acceleration limit.He quickly donned his clothes and mask before he sat down on the corner and wait for the prey's arrival.Thereupon, Jacob heard the voice of the boulder moving as his lips curled. 'He's probably stronger than the mutant. Well, this also means he can probably make my body 50% adaptable with my current heart if I ate him.' He licked his lips like a hungry wolf."Mr. Jack, how about you grace us with your presence?" A sarcastic voice rang in the cave without any hint of urgency.Jacob finally stood up and walked unhurriedly with both hands in his pocket.At the mouth of the cavern, Jacob saw three figures: one was two-meter-tall and burly, while the other two were half of its size. One of them was even wearing a cape.Jacob sounded surprised and fearful. "You're quite far from home, Boss Jerry and Mr. Observer, and… your friend, I guess."Yes, the two of them were indeed Jerry and Mr. Observer from Jerry Pawnshop.Jacob didn't know they would put a tail on him just because of titan iron bricks, and they probably came here after learning he had more and to make sure he won't escape.Jacob had to admit, Jerry was extremely strong, while the capped person also gave off a powerful feeling. He was probably an A grade while Mr. Observer was as strong as that Hob Troll of Killer Skull Society.This lineup was enough to destroy the entire uncommon region, and they're here just for uncommon titan iron?Jacob was now even more interested in why they wanted this titan iron so badly to even leave the protection of Dark City and came all the way here to retrieve it.Jerry smiled coldly as he said, "Mr. Jack, you deserved this treatment. Since we're done with the pleasantries, how about we talk business?" "What kind of business, if I may ask?" Jacob's voice was filled with trepidation."Nothing much, we just want to buy the titan iron you have and also want to know your source. In return, we'll let you…  live." Jerry pulled a sinister smile at this moment while he excluded a powerful killing intent.Although they were told Jacob had buried some bags in the wildness, they weren't sure if they were filled with titan iron. But just the chance was enough to make Jerry leave his turtle shell.He was extremely confident in taking care of Jacob before returning, and with his allies, there was nothing that could go wrong.Even if Jacob had an A rank strength, he can't do anything but submit. As for letting him live, it was the question of whether they needed Jacob alive or not after they learned about his titan iron source.Jerry even prepared a high-level parasite gem to enslave Jacob if they deemed him valuable."In exchange for my life, I'll naturally tell you everything. But can you at least tell me why you're so interested in uncommon titan iron?" Jacob asked sheepishly.Jerry was even more at ease when he sensed Jacob's fear and merely chuckled, "Heh, if I tell you, I have to kill you. But since just made it apparent that you do possess a titan iron source, I'll tell you a little. You see, the titan iron can be turned into a special elixir that can help us grow stronger without any consequences. It is the extent of information I can give you."Jacob's eyes dilated when he heard this."Alright, now that you know, I required you to place this gem on your forehead. Who knows? I might even let you enjoy the elixir if you serve me well." Jerry suddenly tossed a small black pouch toward Jacob and gave an absolute demand.Jacob caught the small pouch when he opened it.It was a parasite gem, but it was slightly different from the parasite gem Decker used on him!

Chapter 110 Prey Or Hunter? (2)
﻿Jacob looked at the crimson diamond shape parasite gem with two long needles on one side and a very tiny black symbol within. Although this parasite gem looked the same as the one in his possession, the symbol on this wasn't the same.Nevertheless, it was the least of his worry. He looked at Jerry while his eyes suddenly turned icy, "You want to coerce me to be your slave?"Jerry coldly smirked, "So what if I am? You can choose to do it the hard way as well. But I don't like to get my hands dirty, but I don't mind it either."Mr. Observer also had a complicated look on his face as he looked at Jacob as if he was looking at his own reflection of the past.He knew the parasite gem in Jacob's hand was an Intermediate-Rare Grade, one which was completely different from any uncommon grade.The items like parasite gems, slaves, firearms, potions, and so on were all divided into Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rarer, and Epic Grades, and each grade has three sub-grades: Low, Intermediate, and Advance.The parasite gem Decker used on Jacob was a low-uncommon grade, which can restrain and control even rare rank species like Decker.But the uncommon parasite gems were useless against powerhouses like B-Rank or even some extremely strong-willed C-Ranks.Only a low-rare grade parasite gem can enslave the aforementioned species, while an Intermediate-Rare Grade Parasite Gem was extremely rare in the Rare Region because it can control someone with A-rank strength!But the most dreadful thing about the rare parasite gems was they weren't like the uncommon parasite gems that can only restrain movement but can't make them talk against their will.Not only the enslaved person lost the ability to move freely without orders, but their thoughts were also like an open book, and as long as they were asked a question, they will instantly answer!The only way to free oneself was to become stronger, which the owner would never allow unless he had a higher quality gem at his disposal.As for taking out those intermediate parasite gems by force, it was simply a pipe dream.Because these gems take root directly into the brain, not just the skull, and if someone tries to force them out, they will suffer serious brain damage.Even if they somehow managed to pull it off, they won't be sane anymore to enjoy their freedom or die of brain damage or by their owners!Mr. Observer was such a case.He can't even have thought of rebelling because Jerry would torture him to end if he found out. He had long resigned to his fate and was completely loyal to Jerry now, and he let him do as he pleased as long as he didn't cross his bottom line.But who wouldn't like their freedom? A slave is still a slave!Slavery is a common occasion in the rare region where slavery was common, and even in the Dark City, you could find slaves if you knew where to look.When Mr. Observer thought Jacob would also become a slave like him and accept his fate, which was far better than death, his next action shocked everyone.Jacob simply put the parasite gem in his 'pocket', before he drew his two crescent short swords, which were giving off a cold, sharp sheen.His index fingers wore the metal bearings in the center of two hits like rings as he started to rotate them close-wise and coldly said, "Let's see if you can back your own words. Let's decided who is Prey and who is Hunter!"Jacob's perfunctory reposed made Jerry's killing intent sore. "Since you want to be valiant, I'll beat you into submission!" He suddenly showed his black gauntlets as he moved forward.The capped figure, which was silent all this time, suddenly took out a jet-black revolving rifle and aimed at Jacob."Don't worry. He won't shoot…"But before Jerry could express his intentions, his eyes contracted because Jacob suddenly moved, and his speed was extremely fast, so fast that he was already a meter away from him, and his sword was coming right toward his head!Shocked, his heart jumped as he never expected Jacob's speed to be this fast, even faster than him!But he was also a combat master, and his reflexes weren't any lower than Jacob's, and he used the thick metal plate behind his gauntlet to block the strike while using his second hand to punch Jacob in the face!He thought Jacob was only proficient in speed, and he won't be able to take his punch.However, what happened next made everyone startled!Jacob's speed suddenly spiked before he twisted around the incoming punch while he changed the trajectory of his sword with a rotation, and before Jerry could react, the sword was already stabbed in his forearm!When Jacob moved the chisel blade, Jerry's entire armed was torn!"Aghh…" Jerry felt blood-curdling pain."Boomm…"The capped figure finally snapped out with Jerry's shrill scream and pulled the trigger hastily.But to his terror, Jacob was ready for this, and he covered himself with Jerry's massive body, and the shot was missed.Jerry wanted to punch Jacob away, but Jacob simply ducked it with his superhuman reflex, and Jerry wasn't even focusing because of the pain of his torn forearm.The next moment, another shrill rang in the vicinity when Jacob tore Jerry's knees!"Ahhh… Bastar… Cogh…"Before he could say another word, the sword was already pierced through his larynx, and when Jacob retrieved the blade back, a fountain of blood bloomed!In less than ten seconds, he had killed Jerry!"boom… boom." The capped person naturally panicked with this unbelievable situation as he started shooting maniacally.But Jacob was ready, and he shielded himself with Jerry's body.'Click… click… click…'The sound of the trigger being pulled forcefully rang in the cave at this moment, which meant there were no bullets!Jacob finally appeared filled with blood like a bloody ghost and instantly closed in the distance between him and capped person."Spare me!" A panicked feminine voice rang, filled with appalling.However, Jacob didn't even blink as he routed his blade, and without holding back he hammered the hilt directly on the capped head, and the next moment, the person dropped to the ground unconscious.Since even Jerry couldn't put in a fight with Jacob, this guy wasn't his match, either.As for Mr. Observer, he was petrified on his spot as if he had seen the most horrifying sight of his life. When Jacob knock him unconscious, he simply fell without making any groan as if he was already scared silly and lost consciousness!However, Jacob didn't stop there. He completely ignored the three and darted toward the forest with a murderous look in his eyes.Right at this moment, something suddenly moved, bolted between trees when it saw Jacob closing in!'How did they all lose!? NOOOO… how did he know I was hiding right in this place? Even that geezer can't tell when I try to hide from him. This guy was probably pretending to be a pig all this time!'The shadow kept darting between trees in appall, trying to get rid of Jacob's hot pursuit.'Why, why, why? This guy can't just give up!''Bang…'A gunshot sounded, it landed right on the shadow's leg, and it lost its balanced.After clashing in some branches, a small cloaked body fell to the ground.A bronze skin ugly face was groaning in pain, but when it saw Jacob sauntering toward him with menacing eyes.He quickly dissuaded as he moved back on his limbs, "D-don't… ahhh… Don't kill me. I can be your slave… I-I know many things!"Jacob suddenly sneered, "Then tell me, do you remember over two years ago, you led two giants toward a hideout?"Jacob was so adamant about hunting this bastard down because this was the same Bronze Goblin, Chad, that screwed him over and made him flee Decker's hideout, and this time he again led Jerry's group to his hiding place!Chad's eyes contracted when he heard this, as disbelief surfaced in his eyes. How could he forget the event that led him to his current predicament?That day, they didn't find anyone in that hideout except some tools and dry bones, even after ransacking the entire hideout. They even waited for two days, but no one appeared.However, those bones they found made the giants agitate, and they wanted to test their origin, and when they did, they nearly went berserk in Dark City, especially Montel, who raised an entire building to rubble.It was all because those bones belonged to an Imp Goblin, who was probably their target of interest!As for the killer, they had no idea, but this also put an end to their search, and those giants were blacklisted for ten years in the uncommon city as well.Chad also suffered because of those giants' actions, and he got the short side of the stick!
