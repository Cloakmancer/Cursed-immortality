Chapter 191 The Conquest Of Doom
﻿After deciding to hunt those zombies, Jacob didn't hesitate and looked for a target.When the entire horde passed Jacob's hiding spot, and there were no more zombies behind, holding his swords, Jacob crept toward the zombie at the very end of the horde.Those zombies were clearly going somewhere without any alertness to their surroundings.Jacob's sword flashed right behind the zombie's rotten neck, making it mute, and before the zombie could even make some random sound and alert the zombie in front, who was only a few feet ahead, the pierced zombie's body vanished into Jacob's pendant.Jacob didn't linger and instantly hid in the closest building before those zombies could notice anything.He then took out the zombie, who was still alive but completely helpless as its mouth was completely blocked by Jacob's blade. It tried to struggle, but Jacob was too quick, and with his second blade, he sliced its head in half.A zombie magic core was always in their head enshrouded within the dead flame, and Jacob precisely cut while keeping this in mind not to damage the magic core if there was one.Although he didn't know if the magic core could handle his blade strike, he didn't take a chance, and that's why he captured the zombie alive to make sure it won't happen.The moment the zombie's head was split into two, the zombie was dead. Jacob didn't pay any attention to it. He looked at the cleaved skull and the black brain within. A blue dead flame was flickering in the center before it was depleted.Jacob frowned since there was nothing else besides the empty hole left by the dead flame, which meant this zombie was coreless.So, he took his swords and moved on to the next zombie at the end of the horde.With all those buildings making it an excellent spot for Jacob to hide and pulverize the zombies, he started to hunt them one by one.Those zombies have no strong will like an intelligent species, so they were all easily pulled by Jacob in the infinity pendant after he gave them a shock by piercing them with his sword.After hunting four zombies like this, he still didn't acquire any magic core.Now it was his fifth zombie, and just like before, he sliced apart its head in two. This time unlike before, the dead flame was slightly bright, and when it was exhausted, a shining emerald magic core.'An Earth Core!' Jacob's eyes gleamed for a moment before he simply stowed it away because he already had a 1-star earth element magic core.But still, this gave him hope since there were over 300 zombies outside, and they were moving west of the dark ruins without paying any attention to their surroundings.This gave Jacob more confidence as he started to capture two zombies from then onward.After pulverizing seven more zombies, he finally acquired another red color magic core, a 1-star fire element core. Now he only needed the wind-type magic core, which should be gray.So, he started to kill those clueless zombies even more passionately, and after killing for half a day his 68th zombie, which was burly from the other zombies and had a strange marking over his rotten skin, he finally acquired a Wind Core.But to his surprise, there were two bright white spots within this crystal-like core, and Jacob instantly knew it was a 2-star wind core, not a 1-star!The bright white spots in them could easily distinguish the magic core ranks. An initial 1-star magic core would not have any bright white spot, while a fully developed 1-star magic core that was on the verge of entering the 2-star rank would have a bright white spot.When a magic core reaches the 2-star initial rank, another bright white spot will be emerged within it, all the way up to 9 such white spots at the 9-star magic core.These bright white spots were called the Stars, and that's why they were ranked in Star Ranks from 1 to 9.Jacob looked at the zombie again. It had a faint marking around its neck, and he mused, 'Is this a high-level zombie? Its strength should be around tier 7 or tier 8. The classification of the Dark Beings is quite vague, and only those skeletons were fully recorded. The zombies were not described in-depth.'Jacob mused as he looked at the zombie deeply. He had to admit, besides those vague lines around its neck; it looked exactly the same as those other zombies he had killed.But he didn't go out hunting anymore since he was quite exhausted after ambushing so many zombies. Since this place was filled with undead, he would get his chance again.Jacob's goal was to collect every element magic core up to 3-stars since the 4-star magic cores fall into the categories of the Extraordinary Tiers.While at it, he would also look for clues about the second and third conditions. He was no longer in a hurry as this place was quite extensive, and he wasn't here for even three days, so he didn't rush things.After calling it a day, Jacob found a destroyed building with an attack basement and started eating the raw meat he had stored in his pendant. ---While Jacob was resting, the reaming zombie horde, after walking for 3 hours, reached a plaza where even more zombies, skeleton soldiers, and warriors were gathering.Ten Dark Beings stood in the center of this plaza over a broken high pillar.Five of them were fully armed skeletons holding shields and swords or halberds. They were Skeleton Grand Warriors, and all of them were extraordinary tiers!While the other five were pale skin zombies with white eyeballs, but their skin was not completely rotten as they had a black tattoo like marking around their necks.These zombies were called Sane Zombies and were also extraordinary tiers of Dark Beings and highly intelligent like the Skeleton Grand Warriors.The Sane Zombies could control zombie hordes and also create more zombies from their special toxic if the cure wasn't taken within an hour.That's why the Sane Zombies were even more dreaded existence than the Skeleton Grand Warriors since they turned their victims into zombie slaves, which was far worse than death.At this moment, all ten extraordinary rank dark beings open their mouths, creating eerier sounds, and the sea of Dark Begins in front of them turned stoic.Those ten then do something strange, they fall onto their knees, and all those low-level dark beings also follow in their tracks.At this moment, the sound of powerful steps and something sharp hitting the ground rang within the silent plaza.Soon a cloaked figure holding a pitch-black staff with a crimson orb imbued on top of it walked on the top of the broken pillar.A spooky voice in a strange language rang from the cloaked figure holding the staff, "My Children! I summon everything because it is time to start the Conquest of Doom!"We have given those preys too much leverage, but they don't know good for bad and dare to break a shackle sneakily. So be it. Since they want to take advantage of our forbearance and want to get eaten, we'll gladly accept their wish!"The King will arrive with his army in three days, and we'll break the reaming shackles before hunting every one last prey!"Those Dark Beings started to make clamor as they became restless.However, at this moment, a deep voice filled with rage rang within the vicinity, speaking in the same language, "Lich Minister, do you really want to break the other shackles as well and call the wrath of High Beings by breaking the Grace Treaty?!"The Lich Minister laugh out loud in an eerily manner while smacking his staff on the pillar, creating shock waves. He replied angrily with killing intent, "2nd Freedom Lord, it's you guys who broke the Grace Treaty, and now you're blaming us for it?! Do you think we are fools to wait any longer before you claim the High Position by destroying another shackle!?"The 2nd Freedom Lord's angry voice also boomed in rebuke, "Lich Minister, you know there is no one from the Freedom Plains present since you barely let anyone out or stay in this place. You're literally garrisoning this place!"Do you think just because you guys won the old High Position, you can bully us?! I dare you to try to break another shackle, and I'll make damn sure this whole plain got annihilated!"The voice was filled with boundless rage as it rang within the vicinity and the aura behind it was even more ghastly, not inferior to Lich Minister.However, Lich Minister didn't back down and roared coldly, "Then I want to see how you can annihilate the whole plain. My King will be here in three days. Let me see if you guys can still play dirty tricks!"After getting rid of the remaining shackles, My King will make everyone our slaves... again. Hahahahah…"

Chapter 192 Rare Freedom Plains Abandoned!
﻿Freedom Plains, the Light Nation, was the strongest among the four powers and also covered the most significant area of the Freedom Plains. The lands were filled with life and peace.However, today, the usual peaceful Light Nation was bristling with activities as platoons of soldiers gathered everywhere as if a war was coming.The Valley of Light was the most mysterious place in the entire freedom plains, and it was the heart of Light Nation because this place never fell into darkness. Even at night, some mysterious power kept it as bright as day.Inside a towering building right in the Valley of Light,In a spacious room, a golden-capped figure with a 1.9-meter height stood in front of large monitor screens. One after another, the screens started to light showing projections of figures who all have something in common.Their expression was as gloomy as they could get.Expect the three screens in front, which had only blurred instead of a clear picture.The person in the golden cap bowed in front of three blurry screens and hoarsely said, "Mighty Lords, please help us!"The other visible figures also do the same as this golden cap, and they all bowed and called in pleading voices, "Might Lords, please help us!""First, tell us who broke the shackle of Dark Ruins?" A melodious voice exempt from any emotion rang from a blurry blue projection.One by one, they started to answer and wholeheartedly declined anything to do with the Dark Ruins.The golden cap person was last to speak, "No one from the Light Nation has gone into the dark woodlands. At least not one powerful enough who could find and break shackle alone!"Especially when the Lich Minister has been guarding that place for hundreds of years, and anything remotely possible to have some connection with the shackle is heavenly guarded by the Dark Beings."If someone of that caliber entered that place who could discover the shackle and the method to break it, then the Second Freedom Lord will be the first one to take action!"It is clear that those malicious corpses wanted to destroy our freedom plains and rule the rare plains alone!"Everyone agreed with the golden cap person.This time a deep voice filled with authority sounded from the blurry red screen, "The shackle was not broken from their side, and we have already confirmed it. The shackle was broken by someone with Life Signal. Which automatically broke the treaty by the Life Faction side."Now the Dead Faction of Rare Plains can attack justifiably, and we can't interfere this time, or this will affect our side. All we can do is stop someone from here from interfering in Rare Plains. You guys are on your own!"The voice was cold and cruel at the end, making everyone listening pale."But we're not a match for the Lich King!" The golden cap figure hoarsely stated with a pleading tone, "Please, you can't abandon us!""Hmph, you guys only have yourself to blame. Always suppressing talents with your selfish rules and killing them if they show ambitions."Since your four freedom lords didn't like to be under anyone's control and instead like to keep others under their control, you can only blame yourself for this blunder."Don't expect us to give you any more help this time. I had enough of your incompetence. If you guys don't solve this problem, the Nightmare Knight Legions will no longer have any ties with Rare Plains!"From now till the day you resolve this problem, all contact with the Rare Plains Nightmare Knight Legion will be completely cut off!" A booming voice rang, filled with rage in the gray screen, making others ashen.But before anyone could react, the person on the other side cut off the connection, and the screen got blank!Despair filled the heart of everyone on the clear screens, and the person in the golden cap fell on the floor as his ragged breathing could be heard.The deep voice also rang again, "You guys had this coming for a long time. As Chairman stated, your four freedom lords didn't hand the complete shares to us, and this plummeted the rare plains' technology progress."And as a result of your selfishness, now someone has already done the damage. If you had taken our full support, it would've never happened."The Alchemy Guild will also cease all contacts until this problem is resolved with all the branches of Rare Plains!"With this, his screen also turned black.Another one of the three hegemony abandoned them!No one speaks. They didn't have the power to since it was too shocking for them. They were all aloof leaders of the freedom plains, but now they were feeling helplessness that they had never felt before. Likewise, they were all arrogant in the past and didn't bow their heads to three hegemonies and believed that they would not be conquered by another, but now they finally understand just how laughable their decision had been.The women's emotionless voice rang again, "I won't blame you as two chairmen did, but I'll put the Bank's interest first so the Zodiac Taurus Bank will do the same."But I'll also leave you guys with some advice since one of the shackles has already been broken by the Life Faction. Try to find and break the other as well. The Rare Plains will only have either 3 or 5 shackles."If it's three, then you just need to break one more, and you can rebuy 1,000 years of peace with your authority as a winner. If it's five, then snatch the reaming two from the Dead Faction's hands."It is the only way. Fight them in dark ruins. It is far better than fighting them in the open when they gain access to all the rare plains. Since the shackle was broken so soon by an unknown factor, this also means the trial this time is easy. So, you only have 10 to 20 years!"With that, the women's screen also vanished.An eerie silence descended on the place.At this moment, a fox head orc suddenly said, "The Killer Skull Society is agreed to help the Rare Plains!"Everyone's eyes turned toward the person as they all looked at him with disbelief.The golden cape person suddenly trembled as he looked toward the screen and hoarsely asked, "You join them?!"The fox face orc sighed and shook his head, "No, but I contacted Important Grace34 prior to this conference since I was prepared if something like this might happen. If you want, I can take him into the conference channel.""How bold of you, Vice Minister of Ice Nation, to dare to contact the enemy of entire freedom plains just on a hunch!" A furious elf yelled."Hmph, we all know who is the enemy of the entire freedom plains right now. Although those guys oppose us all the time, if the Dark Beings manage to succeed, and there is an 80% chance that they will, I would prefer to work with those degenerates than turn into a fucking sheep!" The fox face orc retorted coldly.Silence descent into the room since everyone knew the consequences of letting Dark Beings run wild. They had not forgotten what it was like when the rare plain trial was completed for the first time.The time could only be described as filled with darkness by their predecessors. But alas, now an even worse time was approaching. No matter what, they never wanted to experience those things described in the secret history books.The person in the golden cape finally spoke, "Alright, let him in."His voice was filled with helplessness, and others could only keep their mouths shut since they also wanted to survive.If they wanted to have any chance against fighting with the dark beings in the dark ruins, they needed first to clear their internal conflict and gather all the help they could.Thereupon, a screen lit up, and a person wearing a golden mask appeared, sitting on a chair while the background was completely dark. Only his black eyes shone with mockery behind his mask could be seen.It was Important Grace34!"Ah, so many big faces. I have to say. I'm truly awed."Important Grace34's mocking voice sounded as he looked at those high and mighty figures who always wanted to capture him, but now they were forced to seek his help. He was thrilled, to say the least!"Don't make me regret it. Just state your conditions and don't go overboard, or I rather fight those dark beings!" The person in the golden cap coldly stated as his entire bearing changed from a minute ago when he fell on his knee like a fragile old man.Important Grace34 sneered, "Elder Light, I must say I always wanted to meet you, but you are not easy to get in touch with, and I know you would've never agreed to talk with a degenerate like me, but here we are. Which could only mean those high and mighty hegemonies have abandoned you. Hahaha!"

Chapter 193 The Killer Skull Society Demand
﻿"Just throw him out. We don't need someone like him!" Nixon, who was also observing all this from a screen, coldly spoke at this moment.Every Easter City level head of three hegemonies was a part of this meeting today, including the permanent member like Nixon.This problem naturally involved the permanent members like them since they couldn't flee the freedom plains without crossing the dark wildlands and the Star Ocean. Now even the three hegemonies had temporarily cut ties with them which naturally included these permanent members.Furthermore, Nixon was still upset about Jacob's 'kidnapping'; the biggest culprit was naturally Important Grace34!Important Grace34 coldly looked at Nixon on the screen and sneered coldly, "If it isn't the biggest fool of our freedom plains!"How could Important Grace34 not know about the disappearance of Jacob?But even after they were slender and got hunted by the Nightmare Knight Legion of Easter City, he didn't bother to clear their misunderstanding. Since the killer skull society was still dealing with even more annoying fellows than the freedom plains.Whenever he thought about Jacob, he could not help but ground his teeth in hatred.However, now that he got the chance, he didn't mind releasing some frustration on Nixon. He knew better than anyone just where Faceless Ancient came from, and that guy was far more than what meets the eye. He had learned the hard way.Their current predicament was probably because of him as well, and he hated Jacob's guts, but he won't reveal it since he wanted the freedom plains to suffer at Jacob's hands as well.Furthermore, after their last blunder, the entire human race vanished from the uncommon region and somehow appeared in the epic region's most prominent power's territory, which was completely out of Important Grace34's imagination.But he didn't dare to target them anymore since he had guessed that it was doing of Faceless Ancient and he had some powerful background, so he was still observing like a venomous snake.While in secret, he was still keeping an eye out for the prick because Jacob also had their data on the cannibal research they had been doing in the common plains for decades.He was sure of it since all the hideouts were burned to the ground, and he knew only Jacob could've done it.But the Faceless Ancient was simply too mysterious, and his actions were even stranger because if he was really some big shot, why the hell was he still wandering in Freedom Plains and why he even joined the alliance, and how could he if he was from a higher plain?Or it was just a sham, and Faceless Ancient had nothing to do with the incident with Fire Fiend. Important Grace34 just couldn't figure it out but won't give up until he did.Important Grace34 only cares about that data right now since that data was far more precious than anyone could understand!Hearing Important Grace34's belittling voice Nixon emitted killing intent, he was furious about Jacob's disappearance, and they still hadn't even found a clue about the man.But Elder Light spoke first. There were more pressing matters than some grudge, "If you dare to poke your finger at this conference member. I'll make sure every last member in the skull observation list got executed, and 3rd Freedom Lord will be going to start hunting for you guys personally!"Important Grace34 eyes shimmered darkly. He knew it was the only chance he could earn some solid ground for Killer Skull Society. So, he had to control his temper.He coldly said, "Alright, I won't beat around the bush. First, I would like to tell you that we have a base in the Rare Wilderness Plains, very close to the Wild Nation and well hidden."Only after we noticed a large army marching toward the dark wildlands did I notice what was going on, and after digging around, here we are."The others were astonished by this revelation."So, you're saying you have a safe way out of dark ruins?" Elder Light voice was filled with hidden shock.They knew just how deeply the dark beings were guarding the dark ruins and the other side entrance of it. They were waiting for the grace period to end so they could storm the dark ruins without any challenge at all.But they were also preparing for it. However, that darn shackle was broken by someone, and now they were cough off guard.Even after all these years, they only had a single base on the other side, and it was nowhere near the wild nation because they were afraid of getting discovered by dark beings.Yet, the Killer Skull Society also seemed to have members on the other side, which was quite shocking. They had always belittled the Killer Skull Society, but it seemed they were far more formidable. However, it was also their fault since they only paid attention to the three hegemonies and belittled the killer skull society, who hid behind the blinding splendor of the three hegemonies.Important Grace34 chuckled, "Of course, so this is my first piece of the negotiation. We will provide information about the armies of dark beings."Second, I'm willing to send skull number A-501 to A-1000 in the dark ruins with your army and with all of them being at least Basic Mages and 1000 skulls above A-5000 ranks!"Third, the Killer Skull Society will also share an ancient potion formula that can make anyone at Common-Tier-12 break into Rare-Tier-1 without any side effects!"Another deadly silence descended in the hall as everyone looked at Important Grace34 with slack jaws.A goblin woman coldly uttered at this moment, "Important Grace34, do you think no one in this room knows Potion Alchemy? There is no such a potion without side effects, especially the one that can make a common being rare!"Everyone agreed with this goblin woman.Important Grace34 coolly replied, "I know it's hard to believe, but it is true. I'll send a sample to you, Senior Grandmaster Chaya. You can examine the effect yourself."Elder Light replied, "Very well, if you have such a potion and it has no side effect after Senior Grandmaster Chaya test it, we won't mistreat you. But what do you want?"Important Grace34 eyes turned sharp as he demanded, "Nothing much, make me the 5th Freedom Lord of the Skull Kingdom, which will be the new fifth power of the freedom plains!"Elder Light instantly rejected it sternly, "Impossible, ask for something else!"Important Grace34 shook his head, "Nothing else interests me. You guys can discuss it with Four Freedom Lords, and I want an official announcement and shares registered with the Star Network so you guys won't play any tricks later. I'll also reveal the formula of this potion after getting the promised rewards. I'll send the sample to Light Nation today."Lastly, I would like to warn you guys that make your decision quickly. The Lich King is bringing 50,000 Dark Beings into the Dark Ruins, and fighting is the only shot freedom plains have to remain free, or I can always go to hiding, but can you? Hahahah… Contact me with your answer. I'll give you a week before the offer is off the table!"Important Grace34 instantly cut off the connection.The room descent into gloomy silence as no one wanted to speak. They were completely caught off guard by Important Grace34 this time, and this would never have happened if the three hegemonies hadn't abandoned them.At this moment, an aged voice rang into the room filled with helplessness,"Test the potion and try to reverse-engineer the formula. Don't disappoint us. This is a matter of survival for every living being in the freedom plains. We'll give our verdict after getting the result. You have six days!"---Meanwhile, in the Dark Ruins.It's been the third day since Jacob had cleared one of the three conditions of the Dark Ruins' trial.At this moment, The Dark Beings were literally swarming the place like an ant colony as every alley was patrolled by at least ten or even fifty dark beings together.The buildings were being searched by skeleton warriors and zombies with faint marks around their necks.It was quite clear they wanted to clear the entire place out of any living.Jacob, who had been hunting zombies for the last two days, also noticed this strange change, and they gave him a foreboding feeling.Furthermore, he noticed that around this ruined city's central area, high-level dark beings were teeming that place, and it was almost impossible to enter it.Moreover, there was some kind of barrier at the very edge of the city, which made it quite apparent that leaving this place was impossible unless someone had a passage like the dark beings.Not only that, but he was also closely observing the dark ruins for any clues about anything related to royalty or a king. He noticed that the closer he was to the central area, the larger and more intact buildings appeared!

Chapter 194 Dark Beings Everywhere!
﻿After investigating some broken houses and the debris left by whoever used to live there, he could only guess that this city should be some kingdom's capital and if it was, there had to be a palace or castle.And after seeing all those dark beings teeming the central area, he was 80% sure that what he was looking for was in the central area. But the question was, how should he fool those corpses and sneak there?So, Jacob came up with a terrible but only idea that could get him into the central area.At this moment, he was looking at the rotten skin of a zombie. He just peeled off with a slightly hesitant look on his face.'Fuck it all!' Jacob cussed before his clothes vanished, revealing his ripped body, and he started to 'dress' as a zombie.Although it was a novel experience, given a choice, Jacob didn't want to do it again. Just wearing rotten skin over his own made his skin crawl. Especially when he wore the 'skin mask.'To make it look even more realistic, he even had zombie lenses which were made with real eyes, and after making sure he 'smelled' like a zombie, he wore the tattered rag of pants.Now he looked like a zombie with the marking around the neck, and as long as he won't open his mouth or bleed, no one would tell it was living under the zombie's skin.He'll be fine as long as Jacob's luck won't turn for worse and some dark being has X-ray eyes.After making sure there was no flaw, he didn't go toward the central area but started looking for a zombie horde to see if those zombies could tell if he was a fake zombie or not.As usual, he didn't have to move for long before he found 21 zombies moving in a daze. There wasn't any zombie with marking within them. He slowly started to move toward them as he pretended to be in a trance.Three zombies suddenly jolted as they turned their heads toward Jacob, but after giving him a momentary glance, they didn't pay any attention and continued walking.Jacob's eyes behind the white lenses shimmered in relief, 'Now, I should be fine.'Done with his test, he ditched the group and headed toward the central area of the ruined city. It didn't take long before he was only a street away from the central area.There was a vast road ahead which was blocked by a huge number of skeletons and zombies as they just stood there in a trance. Furthermore, the building around this road was also filled with dark beings.That's why Jacob didn't dare to try to infiltrate the area without preparation. If an extraordinary being was overseeing this place as well, he might get discovered, and he won't be able to escape at that time.Controlling his heart rate and making it as slow as he could, Jacob slowly moved toward the crowd of dark beings standing there like statues.Instantly, all those dead white eyeballs and those empty eye sockets turned toward Jacob, who was walking toward them under the dim light.Jacob felt cold sweat as all those dark beings were staring at him, but he maintained his calm. Since they didn't attack him upright, then this meant his disguise was working.When Jacob was only a meter away from that crowd, his sense was at an all-time high. The moment he senses something, he'll withdraw at full speed.As he entered the crowds, he avoided touching those static dark beings and slowly crawled as he crossed one after another. In that silence only, Jacob's footsteps could be heard even though he was barefoot.Jacob felt like he was walking on a thin sheet of ice, and the moment he slipped, he'll be thrown into hell!The only relief was those dark beings didn't seem to have any hostility toward each other and were just standing there under someone's order.It might be because they were only ordered to attack anyone other than a dark being who tried to cross this passage, or they simply didn't think their own kind could betray them. Or something entirely different.Whichever the reason was, as long as Jacob wasn't attacked, he was content.However, when Jacob walked for almost an hour and the dark beings were not ending at all, he started to wonder just how many of them they were in that place. They literally seemed endless, and they were on every corner.Furthermore, Jacob was currently walking between skeleton warriors and zombies with markings, which made his scalp tingle with trepidation.'Just what is going on? How come they're swarming this place, and why are there so many of them here?' The more he thought about it, the more vigilant Jacob felt.The number of dark beings was growing these past days, and he didn't know why but he had this grim feeling that it might have something to do with the condition he cleared.Furthermore, there wasn't any sign of life in this place, making Jacob even warier of Dark Beings' strange movement.At this moment, he suddenly spotted something which made his eyes dilate.He saw a broken high pillar a few hundred meters from his position. On that pillar was a bone throne, and someone was sitting on it with a pitch-black staff with a shimmering red crystal on top of it.Lastly, there were ten figures standing behind the bone throne like statues.Even in this dark, that place was hard to miss because behind that pillar was a broken wall that was lit with bright magic torches and behind that wall was a silhouette of a castle!However, Jacob didn't dare to move forward because those eleven figures on the pillar gave him the most dangerous feeling he ever felt after returning to life, especially that person sitting on the bone throne. Even that Iron Giant, Elbio, pales in comparison.Furthermore, those skeletons in armor were not hard to guess who they were, and since they were standing behind this person, it was proof enough of that dark being's prowess and authority.'Just what kind of messed up trial is this where you could just swamp the place with numbers and stop anyone else from clearing the trial?' Jacob felt indignant since he finally found what he was looking for, but he couldn't go there.He knew that as long as he entered that castle, he would be one step closer to clearing the other condition or finding some clues about it.But alas, there were over five thousand dark beings, and those eleven terrifying dark beings garrison this place. The moment he alerts them, he will be as good as dead.However, he didn't understand one thing, 'What are they waiting for, and why are they just static like statues?'No matter how he looked at it, the situation was too strange.As if something heard his questions, the figure sitting over the bone throne suddenly raised and smacked his staff over the pillar, creating a crimson shockwave."%#$@@@$$@!" (Make way for the Magnificent Dark King!)Jacob was baffled since he didn't understand what he said, but that voice was extremely eerie. But he noticed something. The moment that voice trailed off, the dark beings came alive as they started stirring.Jacob's heart palpitated as those thousands of dark beings around him started to move. But he didn't lose his nerves and closely followed those zombies' movements, and he quickly got mixed within their crowd.Within moments, the entire blocked road was cleared all the way toward the pillar.Jacob's eyes contracted when he felt tremors under his feet, and he knew something big was coming this way as he quickly stopped breathing entirely.He knew he had chosen a terrible time to infiltrate the dark beings, and now he was riding a tiger's back.Thereby, galloping voices became apparent, and soon, a carriage made with bones and drawn by four zombie horses appeared in Jacob's view.Jacob didn't know who was inside that carriage, but the dark oppression aura emitting from that carriage was no joke. If not for his strong mind, he might even fell unconscious.Two cloaked riders were closely following behind that carriage, and behind them were Skeleton Grand Warriors and Sane Zombies. Probably five hundred each.Following behind them were a huge number of skeleton warriors and mark zombies.Jacob's blood ran cold as he watched that army marching behind that carriage and filling the vast empty road again. It was so crowded that he was an inch away from becoming a sandwich between two zombies.'I need to leave!'Jacob felt it was simply suicided to infiltrate that place right now or ever. This force was probably enough to raise one of the four nations to the ground, and he wanted to pull a wool over them; simply laughable.However, leaving now was easier said than done because the entire dark ruins were teeming with dark beings, and there was no place to hide!

Chapter 195 The Lich King’s Order
﻿Jacob watched as the bone carriage stopped in front of the pillar, and the riders behind disembarked the zombie horses.At this moment, the Lich Minister again spoke, "%#$...!" (Your Majesty, your eternal servants, welcome your arrival!)Jacob still didn't understand what the Lich Minister just said, but when he saw the Lich Minister and the other ten extraordinary beings prostrating themselves before the carriage.All the dark beings suddenly fell on their knees after the Lich Minister, and Jacob naturally followed suit.He knew things had turned bad from worse. An extremely high-level dark being had joined the fray!'Just who could force all the Dark Beings to kneel, even that guy with the staff who was aloofly sitting on that throne a minute ago? Don't tell me some king or leader of the dark beings is in that carriage?' Jacob glanced at the carriage while completely hidden in the dark beings' crowd.One of the riders moved and opened the door of the bone carriage.Thereby, a 3-meter tall dark being stepped outside the bone carriage. He has clad in dark armor. Even the face was hidden behind a menacingly shaped dark helmet. The sheathed black sword on the waist of the armor gave off a feeling of despair.The Lich King suddenly lifted his armored foot, and under Jacob's horrid eyes, he vanished from his spot, and those two riders followed suit!Jacob didn't have to search for long when his eyes fell on top of the pillar, and they dilated when he saw the Lich King was now sitting on the bone throne, and those two riders were respectfully standing on each of his sides.They were simply too fast for even Jacob to follow.'Too strong!' Jacob thought grimly as he started to think of a way out of this place.'The only safe place should be is the skeleton priest temple right now. But I can't stay there forever. The moment my supplies run out, I'll die of hunger and thirst.'I needed to find the exit, but that place might be even more guarded than this one, and with so many high-level dark beings present, it would be suicide to reveal myself. Besides, I don't even know where the exit is.'I don't know why this is happening, but I'm still alive, and they can't see through my disguise, so it is a plus. I should wait and see before contemplating my next course of action.'I don't believe the freedom plains won't have any knowledge about the dark ruins, and they will not notice such a huge movement of dark begins.'Jacob thoroughly calmed down at this moment and focused on being a zombie. This might not be a bad thing since he could observe the enemy's movement while remaining hidden amidst them.This place was dangerous, but as well as safe, as long as he won't provoke or go near those extraordinary, he'll be one of these thousands of zombies.The only problem was he didn't understand what they were saying!At this moment, the Lich King's imposing voice rang, "Rise, my faithful Minister!"Only the Lich Minister rose while everyone remained in this position.Lich Minister respectfully stated as his voice was exempt from arrogance, "My King, your servant was incompetent. I let those preys fool me and stain your glory. Please punish me!"The hierarchy of the Dark Beings was quite simple, they followed the strongest, and as long as someone more powerful appeared to claim that title, no one will stop them.Moreover, the stronger the dark being, the higher their status will be among the dark beings.The Lich King was the strongest Dark Being present in the Rare Plains and ruled the Wild Nation for thousands of years.Many Dark Beings had challenged his position, but they ended up being his subordinates, just like the Lich Minister before him.Rumor has it that it was a sacred rule among the dark beings that if you were defeated by the ruler, you'd be forever his servant.The Lich King emotionlessly said, "You'll be sent to the Ice Grinder for a Hundred Years after this expedition!"The Lich Minister trembled slightly as he respectfully accepted, "I will redeem myself!"The Lich King emotionlessly said, "Tell me, do you found any lead on where the other shackle is and who broke the first shackle or where?""Although it is not confirmed yet. But at that time, only the 2nd Freedom Lord was instated in the Dark Ruins, and we were keeping a tight leash over every entry point we had discovered in these 400 years."So, it was most likely the 2nd Freedom Lord, only he is cunning enough to pull someone like this off among the Four Freedom Lords, or it was simply a fluke. But we are still skimming through the dark ruins for the site of the broken shackle."As for the reaming shackle, one is definitely inside the castle behind my King. It is the only place we manage to discover a secret underground secret room that is completely intact, and there is also a riddle in this secret room!" The Lich Minister revealed."I know about it already. It is the same riddle that should not be spoken, or it will cause the resitter's death, and Wight Minister is guarding that place. I want to know whether you guys decipher the riddle or not." The Lich King coolly questioned.The Lich Minister trembled before he replied, "It was Wight Minister's duty while I was in charge of finding the other places with shackles. As my King already knows, we have to be extremely careful not accidentally destroy the clues, so there is still no progress in finding the second site.""But someone else still beat you to it, right?" The Lich King's voice was filled with darkness as he uttered."It was indeed your servant who is at culpability!" Lich Minister quickly kneeled down."I don't care about finding clues anymore. Just destroy the whole place. The other side had already broken one shackle, and if they again do it, we'll be angering the higher beings if those preys manage to win despite our strength. "The other side will have the same thing in mind as well. Don't underestimate a cornered opponent. If they somehow managed to win the authority, they could easily increase the power restriction cap on their faction. And I don't need to tell you what will happen when such a scenario occurs, right?" The Lich King coldly stated.The Lich Minister horridly replied, "I'll immediately start the search!""Good, we don't just need to clear the entire dark ruins. We also need to stop the other side from completing it for 200 years. As long as the second shackle won't break within 200 years, the old shackle will reset, so the dark ruins with it. It would be easier to clear this place where those prey won't have any advantage." The Lich King coldly sneered."My King is indeed wise!" The Lich Minister quickly agreed with Lich King."Alright, move everyone above the Tier-7 into the vicinity of the castle, and those with tier-9 should guard the outer castle with their life. Lastly, half the Extraordinaries will patrol the inner castle and area around the secret room."I'll be visiting the Wight Minister to see if he deciphered the riddle or not. No one should step inside the castle as long as they're alive!"The Dark Knights will be garrisoning this entrance. The freedom plains won't sit still, and they will start a war of attraction to find the other shackle. This place will be their prime target. Kill them all, and if those fool lords appear, alert me."Meanwhile, keep searching for the other shackles. I won't accept any more blunders on your side. I'll be right here watching everything, and don't make me take action before it is time to break the reaming shackles!" The Lich King gave his final verdict.The Lich Minister and the two Dark Knights standing on Lich King's side accepted, and the next moment the Lich King was gone from the bone throne just as he appeared.Jacob, who was hearing those two's faint mumbling, was perplexed, but he had no choice but to stay still like all those zombies.At this moment, the Lich Minister again looked toward the crowd and shrank loudly, and then all the dark beings stood up.Jacob, who was only fifty meters away from the newly arrived army of extraordinary dark beings, suddenly felt something amiss.At this moment, all those zombies with markings stood straight like solider and every other Dark being present in the area, as a matter of fact.Everyone was facing the castle, including Jacob.Suddenly half of the extraordinary dark beings started to walk toward the castle and behind them walked half of the marking zombie and skeleton warrior army.Jacob was among thousands of zombies who started moving toward the castle!

Chapter 196 The Secret Room
﻿Jacob was astonished as he walked toward the castle.He didn't know why these many dark beings were told to move toward the castle. He felt this had something to do with the dark-armored being who had vanished from the throne.Nevertheless, he could only march forward because those extraordinary dark beings on the pillar were looking at the marching dark being. Especially those two cloaked dark knights, Jacob didn't dare to show any flaw.But if he looked at the bright side, he didn't have to sneak inside the castle anymore, and he might not get another chance like this if he missed this one.Thousands of dark beings enter the ruined castle territory.The extraordinary dark beings led the mark zombies and skeleton warriors toward the castle gates, and they entered the ruined castle.Jacob noticed as they moved forward the number of dark beings behind them had become smaller because they were stopped at a certain point in a group of at least a hundred.'So, they're garrisoning the castle just like the central area.' Jacob frowned slightly as he continued to follow.At this moment, they were moving inside a spacious hallway when the dark beings in front of him suddenly stopped.Jacob instantly knew it was the point where this group would garrison.However, there were still over three hundred dark beings left, excluding the extraordinary dark beings. So, he knew they were going to stop in a deeper area.Since he was already at this point, he didn't want to stop not in this place without any doors or anything at least.He was paying attention to the interior as they were moving, and he knew they were probably at the inner castle right now or close to it.If he wanted to have any chance to clear this place, he needed to investigate the deeper area where a royal family should live or the King! So, gritting his teeth, Jacob moved as he crossed all those dark beings who were now standing still like statues. They didn't attack him and let him pass.He finally escaped the group and followed the group moving ahead, but he slowed down. Since no one was paying attention, it was an excellent opportunity to ditch them while he still had the chance.Jacob didn't know that the Sane Zombies and Skeleton Grand Warriors could use a special signal to command them that only a rare-level dark being could hear.They were using those signals to stop a group of dark beings at specific points, but Jacob wasn't a dark being, so he couldn't feel those signals, nor did those extraordinary dark beings think that someone like Jacob was in their army.Jacob's heartbeat and breathing were so low that even those extraordinary dark beings couldn't sense him as long as he won't appear too close to them.As for those rare dark beings, their senses were not developed enough, and they only thought of Jacob as a zombie with different orders than them. That's how Jacob could still remain unnoticed.Jacob slowly walked until he was completely separate from both groups in the rear and front. His eyes flashed with elation since he never thought he would get such an opportunity to enter this deep into the castle without much effort.Just half an hour ago, he was feeling despair, but now he was feeling that he still had the chance to clear this entire thing now that he was in the castle.At this moment, a closed door covered in a layer of dust appeared in his view at the end of the hallway.Jacob slowly approached the door and stopped in front of it. He then took a deep breath and grabbed the old door handle, and tried to open it. To his relief, it was not locked.In the silent hallway, the creaking sound of an old door being opened rang, which made Jacob's heart tighten, but he continued to open it.When the door was open enough for him to enter, he quickly slipped inside and closed it.Sighed in relief, Jacob looked around and saw it was a spacious room with a broken study desk and some broken bookshelves, and many tatter books were lying on the floor.It was a huge mess, as if someone had thoroughly checked the place already.Jacob smiled bitterly, 'How could those dark beings leave this place unchecked? By the looks of it, those dark beings were sure that this castle was a place where a trial condition lay, and they might've already found it.'Maybe those extraordinary dark beings and that dark armored being been heading toward that place. If that's the case, should I follow them? No, I can fool those rare ones, but those extraordinary dark beings will instantly see through my disguise.'Jacob fell into deep thought as he looked around the room, 'I'm so close, yet still too far. Then there is this language problem!'Jacob now was feeling even more vexed that his biggest shortcoming was not his strength but his lack of language. He never thought he would resent such a thing in his life.He tried to see if those books on the floor were in the common language of freedom plains. Furthermore, he picked up a blue cover book that looked intact and opened it, but alas, the pages were completely rotten, and the words on it were completely gone.But he didn't give up and picked up another book since these tatter books still remained intact without turning into dust like the ones in the temple. This means that they were made with special materials as well.Although that material was not as good as the two writings, he found in the temple. They were still good enough to keep those books intact!---While Jacob was searching for clues, a few hundred meters below him was a spacious underground room that looked exactly like the one where Livia led him where the skeleton priest was.However, this place was ten times larger than the one where the skeleton priest was, and in the center of this room was a large stone throne and a stone statue sat on this throne.In front of this Stone Throne was another statue that was kneeling, but the head was missing, so it was hard to tell the appearance.Words in rune language were inscribed on the walls right behind the stone throne. While on the left, right, and ceiling were murals. Furthermore, the floor was filled with all kinds of books and scrolls.Right in front of this throne was an opening and a staircase which led upward.At this moment, heavy footsteps like metal clashing with stone rang in the silent room.A cloaked figure who was standing in front of a mural holding a book in his hand jolted out of his daze when he heard those footsteps. He moved his cloaked head toward the entrance as two ghastly blue flames lit under the cloak.The tall armored Lich King stepped inside the room at this moment.The cloaked figure trembled slightly before he vanished from his position and appeared kneeling in front of the Lich King.He respectfully greeted, "Your eternal servant Wight Minister is at His Majesty's service!""Rise!" The Lich King stated before he moved toward the stone throne while he observed the murals.The Wight Minister kept his head low as he followed behind the Lich King. He didn't dare to distract the King's thinking process.Wight Minister's bone finger suddenly shimmered in blue light before the scatter books magically started to fly out of the Lich King's way and bundled into a corner.The Lich King didn't seem to bother as he continued to move. After giving a deep glance at the throne and the headless kneeling figure. He moved behind the throne and looked at the wall with the rune language.The Lich King was already quite familiar with dark ruins condition since this place was very important to his conquest to rule the entire rare plains.While the other time, he waged war on the magic beasts in the rare wilderness plains and increased the dark being's prowess.There was only one phase written on that wall, and the Lich King could easily read it since Dark Beings were not unfamiliar with rune and philosopher's languages. They had their own means to acquire knowledge from higher plains like the living.The phrase read, 'My Salvation lies under King's Dignity and Lord's Blessing.'However, he didn't speak this phase out loud because whoever did in the past was turned into dust, and the Dark Beings had lost a valuable Dark Knight to learn this fact!The Lich King finally spoke while his face still facing the phase, "Any progress on how to break the shackle here?"The Wight Minister quickly replied respectfully, "I have already been informed of our current situation by Lich Minister. I'm very close to deciphering this riddle. The answer lies in the murals. Please take a look at my research, Your majesty!"A black book suddenly flew toward the Wight Minister!

Chapter 197 The Dark Annihilation Army
﻿After skimming through every tatter book, Jacob found nothing he could understand because these books weren't even in rune language or philosopher's language. They were in some entirely different language.Helpless, he could only give up and decided to go with another simple approach: to enter deep within the castle where those dark beings were going. Especially the Extraordinary Dark Beings.However, he didn't dare to do it right now because that 'Armor Leader' was still vivid in his mind, and those dark knights and lich minister outside.If he wanted to do this, he needed some distraction to keep at least those on the outside occupied and, most importantly, make sure the Lich King wasn't in the castle!So, for now, he was planning to remain hidden in this room and let those dark beings settle for now and then start his scouting.He still had enough food and water to sustain himself for half a year or even longer if he stayed static and only ate a small amount once a day.Meanwhile, he was going to prepare something just in case his life fell into jeopardy and also control the fluid acceleration to a higher level because he knew he would need it.Although this place was still in the open, the Dark Beings were guarding the area against every side, and unless they ordered, no one would come here. Even if they did, Jacob could handle it as long as they were alone!---A month passed since the Lich King had garrisoned the central area of the Dark Ruins with over 60,000 dark begins.Furthermore, the dark beings were constantly skimming through the dark ruins while also madly destroying any intact building as if they were searching for something.At this moment, in the Dark Woodlands area-1, which was the military base of Light Nation.Influential figures gathered in a spacious hall, and everyone had solemn expressions on their faces. There were elves, giants, dwarfs, kobolds, demi-humans, orcs, and all the intelligent species' upper echelons were gathered in this palace.If it were any time else, they would've never left the Freedom Plains' safety, but now it was too late since they could fight or wait to get annihilated once the dark beings got rid of the protection over freedom plains.This news had long been spread to the ignorant common public of the freedom plains. They all knew about the dark beings and the danger they posed to them.It caused a massive commotion as all those people living their lives peacefully came to the realization that there was a terrifying force of the undead who wanted to eradicate them.The matter about the Dark Ruins was also no longer kept a secret since it was meaningless.The four power once deliberately tried to keep this information under tight wraps since they thought that it wouldn't do any good to let those people know about the presence of Dark Beings, especially those civilians, despite the three hegemonies wanting the opposite.But the Four Freedom Lords went against it, and now, those people were too comfortable with their lives, especially those in high positions. This revelation hit them the hardest, and now everything was a mess.However, the four powers were ready as they quickly controlled the situation and gave them hope by telling them that they had already broken a shackle and that as long as they broke another one, they would be able to live even more magnificently.But the entire truth about shackles being more than three wasn't revealed.This naturally gave everyone a glimpse of hope and even motivated them that they had a chance against those undead creatures.So, now a widespread army recruitment called the Dark Annihilation Army was going on the Freedom Plains.This army was going to be fighting in the dark ruins and searching for the last shackle, and every race present on the freedom plains will have to send 50% of their entire forces, or they will be banished into the dark wildlands.Even those retired veterans weren't spared, and those aristocrats of prominent families who had never been on the battlefield and enjoyed the glory of their predecessors had to participate as well.This decree was absolute because it was signed by the Five Freedom Lords!Yes, this was probably the most shocking thing after the revelation of the dark beings and dark ruins.It was disclosed that there were Four Freedom Lords who were the true rulers of the four powers of freedom plains, and now there was a Fifth Freedom Lord as well as the fifth power.The Skull Kingdom of Killer Skull Society and the Fifth Lord was the Grace Freedom Lord.This action of the four powers was seen as just how desperate they were and how grave this situation was.If not for the revelation of the Dark Beings and Dark Ruins, most people would rather revolt than let the Killer Skull Society establish their own fifth power so easily.But no one seemed to care because they needed every last bit of help they could get.The Killer Skull Society did not come empty-handed. They had revealed a powerful potion that could be made a peak common tier expert a rare tier without any side effects, and this fact was verified by four nations!This helped the killer skull society earn praise from many no one tried to oppose them for now, and so the fifth power came into prominence. But this event quickly died as today was when the Dark Annihilation Army would be moved out toward the Dark Ruins while they would also start cleaning up all those hidden dark beings on this side of the Dark Woodlands.Lastly, this army's leader was the 2nd Freedom Lord, the Golden Swords Freedom Lord, and he was personally going to lead this massive army of 100,000 into the dark ruins to fight with dark beings!"Silence, the Army Lord has arrived!" A handsome golden elf wearing beautiful emerald armor announced.The entire place fell into silence as they looked toward the high stage with curiosity and even reverence.Until a month ago, some of them didn't even know what Freedom Lords were, but now that they knew, they were naturally curious about these mysterious Lords of the Freedom Plains.Distant steps were heard before a tall man clad in exquisite white armor walked onto the platform, his face was covered under a white mask, but his blue eyes and long golden hairs were evidence of him being an Elf!Many were shocked, but those old members of each race were calm since they already knew the four freedom lords were a Golden Elf, two Iron Giants, and a Demi-Human.However, their identities were always mysterious, and only their race was known.However, the Golden Swords Freedom Lord wasn't alone as closely following behind him were many figures of different races as they wore battle gears and had this wild aura and cold eyes of predators!Jacob would've recognized one giant figure amidst them if he were here. It was Elbio!Many people's faces fell when they saw all those wild figures following behind the Golden Swords Freedom Lord.But they all kept their mouth shut as the Golden Swords Freedom Lord stopped in the middle of this platform while all those people stood behind him while coldly glaring at the crowd below.Golden Swords Freedom Lord spoke in his calm voice, "Everyone, I'm pleased to see everyone standing united against this terrifying force who wanted to destroy our home."We are going to start a war which we had only a 20% chance of winning. I won't hide this from you. The Dark Beings are terrifying existences, especially the extraordinary ones, not to take above those Dark Beings with the status of Ministers and Knights."These Dark Beings couldn't be killed without destroying their Dead Flame Cores. They can recover as long as they have other dark beings around them by absorbing their dead flames, or they can outright absorb the life force from life crystals that they create by refining the life force of a living being like us."There are even more astonishing and deadly facts about them, like a Mark Zombie, could cast ten times more Basic Spells than a Basic Mage in our ranks. Although those zombies only know one magic spell, I don't need to tell anyone just what kind of damage a basic spell could cause, right?"Then there is still their toxicity which they used in the sham of their spell, especially if those mark zombies were controlled by a sane zombie who is as deadly as akin to 5 Basic Master Mages and could turn any living into a zombie and continue to increase his numbers rapidly."Lastly, the Skeleton Grand Warrior is even scarier than an Extraordinary Giant when it comes to battle magic. They are the true vanguards of Dark Beings."Golden Swords Freedom Lord coldly scanned the shocked faces of those below the platform and coldly uttered, "That's why we need veterans who were fighting them for a long time in Dark Woodlands, and some of them even managed to come back alive from Dark Ruins!"

Chapter 198 Humans Vanished!
﻿Golden Swords Freedom Lord's words rang like morning bells in everyone's ears.They all knew that most of those standing behind the Golden Swords Freedom Lord were misfits, fugitives, and deserted members of four powers who didn't want to be controlled and like independence.Some of them were here to have a chance at living because they offended someone who wanted to leave the dark woodlands.But when these fugitives found the true horror of dark woodlands, they would either be forced to go back or join another fugitive crew to survive.These crews then plundered the four powers bases in dark woodland to make a living, and they were not easy to get rid of either. They all knew how to handle themselves in this place crawling with dark beings because without it. They won't be able to survive.Most of them were doing it because they were angry that they were caged in this place like wild animals, and the four powers won't let them return to freedom plains either, not as a free native, at least.But this came as a shock to everyone that these famous misfit crew leaders had come here with Golden Swords Freedom Lord, and from his words, they were going to join them!No one knows how Golden Swords Freedom Lord did it, or he even found their secret hideouts.But no one knows that these crew leaders all once fell into Dark Ruins, and they were all saved by Golden Swords Freedom Lord and sent back from the only passage out, which was guarded by the Golden Swords Freedom Lord himself.They were all in his debt, and Golden Swords Freedom Lord also knew what they were doing here, but he didn't stop them and even let them prosper.Because Golden Swords Freedom Lord wanted them to grow into this environment, and when the Grace Treaty ends, they will be excellent generals and trump cards to play against Dark Beings when they officially fought against them for Dark Ruins.However, Jacob threw Golden Swords Freedom Lord's plans into disarray 100 years prior, and now everything was a mess.Golden Swords Freedom Lord secretly hated whoever broke the first shackle, not because he had done it early but because the benefits would now be given to that person even if Dark Beings broke the rest of them.Although it won't be anywhere near as lavish as the winner's rewards, it would still be something that even a Freedom Lord like Golden Swords envied Jacob.Now that person was still hidden or had already been captured by the dark being while they were left to clean up this mess.Lastly, if the Grace Treaty had ended without any accident, both sides could only send 10,000 troops every five years to fight over Dark Ruins, and Lich King or Free Lords couldn't participate before a side broke the first shackle.Both sides could've easily made strongholds if everything had played according to the treaty.But now, the Lich King took full advantage of this situation and led 50,000 ready troops into the Dark Ruins before the Freedom Plains could even assemble their forces.That's why everyone hated whoever cleared the first shackle since now they would suffer tremendous casualties just to develop a stronghold, and according to Golden Swords Freedom Lord, the Dark Beings were very close to breaking a shackle themselves.So, the pressure was tremendous.Golden Swords Freedom Lord continued, "These veterans behind me will lead an army unit, and they will be no longer fugitives but Level-2 Citizens and Army Captains. If someone has a problem, they could speak now before we discuss our strategy."Although everyone's expression turned nasty, they knew who was in front of them, so they kept their mouth shut."I would like to ask something!" At this moment, a cold voice sounded, drawing everyone's attention.When they saw a group of masked people, their expressions turned ugly.Golden Swords Freedom Lord looked at them and nodded, "Please speak freely, Skull of Skull Kingdom."If it were in the past, the Killer Skull Society wouldn't even dare to appear anywhere near this base, much less dare to raise their opinion on the matter of freedom plains.But now they were equally qualified as the other four powers. The masked skull didn't mind being called a 'skull' since he already was. He was the leader representing the Skull Kingdom's force, Skull No. A-501!Skull No. A-501 said, "My question is not about the people standing behind you, but about the Dark Ruins. Sir. Freedom Lord, is it true that Dark Beings already knew the position of a shackle?"Golden Swords Freedom Lord coolly replied, "Yes.""I would like to suggest infiltrating that place with our best stealth experts and snatching that shackle from Dark Beings!" Skull No. A-501 boldly declared."Heh, everyone, there is a god among us who know to clear the shackle, which even the dark beings hadn't been able to do for hundreds of years!" A troll sneered disdainfully.Everyone sneered coldly because they had the same thoughts.Golden Swords Freedom Lord's eyes also flashed with a hint of derision as he asked, "It seemed Fifth Freedom Lord had another scheme."Skull No. A-501 remained completely calm despite those disdainful eyes and nodded. He revealed, "As long as we managed to enter the shackle's exact location, we have a way to make it completely unassessable for any dark being for ten years!"Now Golden Swords Freedom Lord's eyes winded as he thought of something and looked at Skull No. A-501, "Don't tell me you guys have…."Skull No. A-501 nodded, and his tone was filled with mockery, "2nd Freedom Lord is indeed knowledgeable. But we want the rewards if we manage to win. Except for protective barriers, we won't give away anything; this is a fair exchange. Or pretend as if I said nothing, and we can always try finding the other shackles."Everyone in the room was looking at Skull No. A-501 with slack jaws because by Golden Swords Freedom Lord's words, they could tell the Killer Skull Society had, indeed, something else up in their sleeves.First, the mysterious potion, and now this mysterious thing that can stop the dark begins from entering the shackle's area.Golden Swords Freedom Lord's deeply looked at Skull No. A-501 before he said, "I'll have to discuss it with other Lords, and I'll contact the Fifth Lord with my answer. Now we'll discuss the strategy if you guys have no more things to add.""Please!"Skull No. A-501 didn't speak anymore since he knew the message was delivered, and now they just had to wait for the fish to take the bait!---Inside the secret headquarters of the Killer Skull Society in Rare Plains,Important Grace34 was standing in front of a blurry, dark hologram at this moment.A melodious voice rang, "I have never thought you'll earn such a place for us in Rare Plains, No. A-0. But it still won't make up for your blunder with our cannibal data."Important Grace34 or Skull No. A-0 respectfully spoke, "I know it is not enough to redeem myself, but I'm doing everything I can to recover the lost data. But that hateful rat is just too hard to track down.""Hmph! Since he can enter the Type-1 Plain's life plain without getting blocked by the barrier, then, this means he's a native of Rare Plains and under the strength restriction level of Type-1 Plain."Don't forget this is not Type-0 Plain where strength restriction is almost null for Type-1 Plain Natives. So, stop making excuses like some hidden force behind him." The woman sounded completely displeased.Skull No. A-0 eyes were filled with helplessness, "I know that's why I didn't stop looking for him. But he had almost vanished after pulling a fast one on the legion.""Keep searching. Now that you have the official share of the Life Plain, no one will restrict our movement. As for Dark Ruins, the package will be delivered in 2 years." The woman coldly stated.Skull No. A-0 respectfully nodded, "I understand. Those fool lords will definitely fall for this and help us lead to the shackle guarded by the Lich King. Once we clear the trial, there will be no hegemonies or dark cities in the rare plains!""Heh, those high and mighty idiots won't care about Type-1 Plain." The woman sneered coldly."Yes, my lady, once I get rid of all obstacles, we no longer need the data. I can always grab those humans…."Before Skull No. A-0 could finish his words, but the woman cut him short."The Humans vanished from the Common Plain a month ago!"Skull No. A-0's eyes widened as he blurted, "How is that possible?!"The woman gravely divulged, "We also wanted to know the exact thing. But we are still out of luck since the Forest Elves who were sheltering them have been gone with them, and their empty territory is currently being fought over!"

Chapter 199 A Courtyard!
﻿Six months passed since Jacob broke the first shackle, and he had started waiting for a distraction, but there we simply no movement in the vicinity of the castle.He was also running out of ration, and he could only go on like this for two more months.So, today, Jacob decided to move out and hunt for Extraordinary Dark Beings!Because the time spent in his room wasn't gone in vain, as he had already made progress with fluid acceleration and had even more profound control over his heart rate and breathing.Jacob knew the clash with extraordinary dark beings was inevitable, even if someone distracted the Lich King and his ministers. So, he was preparing for his next move. Even if no distractions come, he knows he doesn't have the luxury of time to wait until it does.Since no one was coming, he had to move out himself.But he wasn't desperate enough to storm his way toward the inner castle. He was still going to use his zombie disguise, which was stowed in the infinity pendant, not to get spoiled.After Jacob became a zombie, he opened the door that hadn't been open since he entered here. He had to admit the dark beings were really obedient like machines as in these few months he hadn't even heard a movement from outside.They were still standing listlessly in their spots without caring about eating or drinking; heck, they didn't even need to breathe.A dark being's lifespan was as long as their Dead Flame existed, and a Dark Being, like a tier-1 Skeleton Soldier or Toxic Zombie, could stay alive for 100 years without absorbing any life force.Life Force was fuel to their dark flame, and as long as they absorbed enough, they would evolve into higher tiers. But there was one restriction on rank evolution, the Life Force level!If a Dark Being wanted to evolve from a Rare-Tier-9 to an Extraodianry-Tier-1, they needed the life force of an Extraodinry-Tier-1 living being and not just a single but multiple.Or if they could just grow by absorbing low-level life forces, then there would be an incredible number of Extraordinary Dark Begins, and Lich King would've long crossed the power cap of Rare Plains.That's why dark beings always wanted to devour every living; the stronger they are, the more they will grow.Still, the lifespan of an Extraordinary Dark Being was ten times greater than a living, and they could continue to live as long as they had life crystal filled with extraordinary tier life force. In contrast, a living being would eventually die!In a sense, they were immortal if they had an endless amount of life force, but it also made them depend on living beings since, without them, there would be no life force or life crystals.They will perish just like any other life out there.If Jacob didn't have cursed immortality, he might've wanted to join the undead once he found out about this fact. But now, he won't even if someone offers him to.Because the dark beings were completely restricted by those with higher evolution than them and can't seem to go against them if they don't evolve.An extraordinary sane zombie could easily stop any zombie below him from absorbing higher level life force and prevent them from evolving any further or simply forbid them from absorbing any life force and letting them rot. They won't be able to go against that order.A Lich which is a higher evolution above the Sane Zombie could do the same to Sane Zombie, and they were as intelligent as any living. At the same time, the Wight was a higher evolution of a Skeleton Grand Warrior.This is also the highest evolution that any Dark Being could achieve while staying in the Type-1 Plain!The only comfort was as long as they needed a massive amount of such live force to evolve into a Lich or Wight, which could only be acquired from living beings as strong as them in rank.So, it wasn't easy for a Lich or Wight appeared among the Dark Beings for centuries. The Dark Knights were all those who had started to evolve into either a Lich or Wight but were still a distance away from reaching it.Jacob had no idea what kind of creatures were guarding the secret room as he moved deeper into the castle.After moving for two hundred meters in the left hallway, he saw a cross path that was blocked by a group of dark beings, which meant he was on the right path.Those dark beings only glance at him before they return to being dead.Jacob chose to go left again while crossing the dark beings. He was almost used to it now and didn't even flinch while moving within them.However, the passage he chose turned out to lead into a gloomy courtyard that was filled with debris and weeds. There weren't any traces of dark beings here, which means he should've gone to the right corridor.But he didn't choose to leave immediately and decided to investigate this place. Although he wasn't hopeful but still if he could avoid those dark beings, he would prefer to do it.A castle where a royal family lived should have many hidden passages for their escape. If he could find one that led to the innermost area, he wouldn't have to risk trying to assassinate the extraordinary dark beings.Only the ground floor was intact in this courtyard, and Jacob found nothing but dust and stones in this palace. He couldn't guess who this place belonged to, but it should be someone from the royal family.After searching for fifteen minutes, he approached the last room. There was no door, and he didn't have much hope for this place either.However, when he entered the room, his eyes winded because he saw a broken status just like the one in the ruined temple, but it was half of its size, but it was definitely the status of the Priest Skeleton!There was also a broken altar in front of this statue which should be there for offerings which made this room a payer room or a small worship temple for whoever used to live there.There were broken pieces of statue and debris in this room and nothing else. Jacob would've thought the same if he hadn't seen the secret room in the temple!With great anticipation, he approached the wall behind the statue and started to scrutinize it.After scratching around the wall for a while, Jacob finally found a faint outline.'Jackpot!' Jacob knew he had stumbled upon a huge opportunity.Jacob then took out his short sword and tried cutting a holder so he could pull the door. He knew there was no mechanism to open this door. It was only opened with a push from inside.It was probably made this way to fool others into thinking that there wasn't any trap door unless they had enough time to try destroying these thick walls. The temple's trap door was made the same way.Only if someone knew about that door would they think this way.Jacob then carved a small handle into the wall and pushed it. With a loud sound, the wall suddenly split, and a thick brick door opened.Jacob frowned because of the sound, but he knew it was already too late. But the distance between the extraordinary beings and this place was quite large, so they might not have heard it at all.Nevertheless, Jacob only opened it enough for himself to slip in. But he didn't enter instantly. He wanted to make sure this place would remain hidden.So, he quickly started to block the entire section of the hallway with debris so everyone would think there was no door in the hallways, and it ended right there.It would almost look like a wall crumbled in this place. But he wasn't satisfied with it since anyone would be able to know if they tried to see past the debris that there was a hidden door behind it.So, he set up TNT with a trip wire, and the moment someone tried to clear the debris, it would go off, and the entire hallways with the room will crumble!This way, he would also know someone had discovered this place or if he came back after discovering nothing, this would also be proof that no one had come here since he left.Then he hid the handle he carved by filling it again, then quickly entered the room and closed it just like it was before!---Two days after Jacob discovered the trap door.In the east wing of the ruined castle, there was another courtyard like the one he discovered, and there was a worship room with a broken statue of a priest's skeleton.The wall behind the statue suddenly trembled before it opened, revealing black-clad figures!

Chapter 200 Phantom Spider
﻿Behind the hidden door, Jacob discovered another room that was actually the same as the one in the temple.However, there wasn't anything inside besides a stone bed. This made Jacob somewhat disappointed. But still, he was more interested in the walls of this room because if it was the same as the temple, then one of the walls should be a hoax.If not, he would be very disappointed, and all his preparation to hide this place would go in vain.Jacob slashed the left wall without wasting time since the temple's secret room's left wall was hollow.However, even after destroying a huge chunk of it, there was nothing but solid stones, which made Jacob frown. So, he tried the other walls.But after half an hour, the empty, clean room was now filled with stone rubble, and he discovered nothing. Those walls were all like normal walls, and his expression was dark.Yet, he still didn't give up, and his eyes landed on the stone bed.Jacob grabbed the stone bed and tried to remove it from its position when his lips curled up because the bed was completely stuck in its place.'The bed in the temple was completely mobile, yet this one is fixed.' He thought as his eyes turned sharp.He made a fist, punched in the center of the bed like a hammer, and completely destroyed it like it was made of soft clay.Jacob's eyes narrowed at this moment because the stone bed was actually hollow from the inside, and the moment it broke, a gray metallic cylinder appeared. This cylinder was a foot long and six inches wide.Jacob picked it up and instantly felt something moving within the cylinder, 'A cover to seal something?'Intrigued, he shakes it, and just as he thinks there is something inside it, there is no sign of sealing on the cylinder or lid. It was smooth, like an ingot.Furthermore, when all the things here were decaying, this cylinder was completely fine without any tract of decomposition.Jacob hesitated for a moment before he decided to cut it open.However, he was astonished when his Basic-Rare Grade Titan Iron Sword didn't even leave a scratch on the cylinder. This blade could cut into stones like butter, but this cylinder wasn't even scratched.So, he used his strength this time as he slashed on top of the cylinder with the full power he could muster without fluid acceleration, which was 800 tons!However, when both metals collided, they only made some sparks before his blade bounced back, which shocked him.The cylinder was still fine without any scratch whatsoever, while the titan sword was now slightly chipped.'Just what kind of metal is used to make this thing, and what is stored inside? I probably need a laser or ever stronger metal than titan iron to cut it open.' Jacob mused with a grim expression.Nevertheless, since it was hidden inside this bed and this cylinder was even tougher than titan iron, this meant whatever was inside was a treasure. So, he stowed it away and decided to deal with it after leaving this place.Then his focus turned to the floor beneath the bed, there was a black lever, and Jacob twisted it without hesitation. It was clearly stuck, which meant it hadn't been used for a long time, but Jacob managed to twist it without breaking it.'Click…'A sound of something behind opening rang in the room, and the next moment, the entire room suddenly trembled before, with a snap, a trap door broke free from the floor right where the lever was.Jacob then pulled open the trap door, which was actually made of thick metal like a treasury door, and under it was an iron ladder that was quite rusty. He couldn't see the bottom at all as there was no light whatsoever, not even those magic torches.So, Jacob took out a flashlight and flashed it into the dark passage, there were walls around, and it was made like an underground tunnel, and the bottom was still unclear.Still, there was nothing out of the ordinary, so Jacob decided to take the rusty ladder and slowly started to descend.The tunnel was over a hundred meters deep, and Jacob finally saw the solid ground.The ladder and tunnel ended ten meters above the ground, and Jacob had to jump down. When he landed at the end of the tunnel, he flashed the flashlight and saw he was in an underground dusty cobweb corridor.'This should be some kind of escape route or hidden passage that led toward some hidden chamber.' Jacob presumed.A few meters behind him was a wall, and the only open way was ahead of him. So, he walked toward it while he was vigilant of his surroundings.Although this corridor looked normal, there might be traps hidden for intruders if they hadn't gone rotten with time, so he had to be careful.After walking for a few tens of meters, a cross path appeared, which made him frown.'Don't tell me it is another fucking maze!' Vexed, he chose to go right.However, he only moved a few meters into the pathway when he heard movement in front of him, which startled him. A shotgun appeared in his hand and flashed his flashlight ahead, but then the movement suddenly stopped.But there was no one ahead either. It was completely empty passage. Yet, Jacob knew he had heard some movement, so he turned around and went toward the left passage to see if he could draw this person out.Jacob pretended that he didn't notice anything and just changed his mindHe suddenly thought of Livia, who had been transported into the catacomb maze, so this might turn out to be the case. But if the person turned out to be like Livia was a whole other case.In the deep darkness of the right corridor, on the ceiling, which looked completely fine, crimson eyes suddenly appeared on it, and those eyes that could see as clear as day were coldly looking at Jacob's retreating figure.Even in the light, those eyes remain invisible, and Jacob doesn't notice anything despite looking right into it. At this moment, those eyes started to creep toward Jacob!Jacob again heard vague movement, which made it quite clear that something was really there and now following him. But the movement was so vague that he couldn't pinpoint the exact location.Furthermore, the other party had no heartbeat whatsoever, and he could only hear it moving, which meant it was most likely a dark being.But he knew the party was still oblivious to the fact that he had already discovered its tracks, and now Jacob was at an advantage.Jacob suddenly entered 1X acceleration as his hearing increased, and he was finally able to pinpoint the exact location of his stalker.'On the ceiling and multiple legs?' Something came into Jacob's mind.The next moment thereafter, CT.408 sniper rifle appeared in his hand, and in that instant, he took an accurate shot where that thing was crawling!'Shhhh…'A strange, eerily cry suddenly rang in the silent vicinity as eight crimson eyes filled with bloodlust surfaced on the ceiling. Also, a two-meter-wide black body with twelve long legs in red strips also came to light.Jacob's lips curled into a cold smile when he saw this creature, "Only a Rare-Tier-9 Phantom Spider and here I thought it was some undead!" The Phantom Spiders were predators who were stealthy with their camouflage ability in darkness, as well as their deadly poison and web. These creatures were relatively rare in the rare plains because they lived in cold areas where the sun couldn't reach.Jacob never expected to encounter one in this place. But he wasn't worried anymore since it was just a magic beast.There was a hole in that Phantom Spider's cephalothorax as the green matter was coming out, which was clearly the bullet hole.The Phantom Spider's eyes were filled with viciousness as it lunged toward Jacob with its menacing mouth opened and suddenly sprayed a gray liquid!Jacob was completely relaxed as he dodged instantly, stowed away his sniper rifle, and took out Livia's long sword. He didn't want to waste ammo on this thing when he could cut it down easily.The Phantom Spider was shocked when Jacob suddenly vanished from his spot, and it was busy twisting his massive body when it felt weight over its large stomach.But before it could react, a sharp blade flashed past its ugly head and cleaved it!Jacob then looked at the massive listless body of the Phantom Spider and frowned, 'It's not eatable… No more importantly, how did it survive in this place? Don't tell me….'Jacob's eyes winded as he felt his skin crawling when he looked deep into the corridor, and he was dumbfounded because multiple glowing crimson eyes were madly heading toward him!
