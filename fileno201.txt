Chapter 201 The End Of The Corridor
﻿Jacob grimly watched over ten phantom spiders crawling toward him as he remembered a piece of important information about the Phantom Spiders.They were predators who lived in colonies and also used cannibalism to sustain themselves when there was no prey. The weak Phantom Spiders would become nutrition for strong Phantom Spiders, and the vicious cycle would continue.The Queen Phantom Spider was the same as she ate her children to make even more of them like an endless food supply.Jacob never thought there would be a colony of Phantom Spiders in this underground passage, and they were probably here for a long time.Now that a fresh prey like him had appeared, it would naturally draw these spiders toward him like a beckon in darkness.Lastly, Jacob knew the Phantom Spider Queen had to be an extraordinary being, and she was probably hiding while controlling these Phantom Spiders to exhaust him before striking.However, Jacob wasn't going to fight them head-on either since he knew those spiders might be a part of a large army, so fleeing this place was probably for the best.Besides, a Phantom Spider had a Poison Magic Core, which had no use to him, so fighting them was even more meaningless.So, Jacob swiftly turned around and fled toward this passage's exit. Those Phantom Spiders were quite fast but not as fast as Jacob, who was in his 2X acceleration already.Now, he could only hope that the other passage wasn't a spider nest, or he would have no choice but to either retreat back to the hidden ladder or fight his way out of these passages.Jacob quickly reached the split corridor, and those spiders were still quite far, so he quickly took the other passage and vanished into it without making any noises.Although those spiders have excellent night vision and their hearing sense might be best among in rare tier. But as long as Jacob could draw some distance and then keep his tracks hidden, those spiders won't be able to tail him.However, Jacob had only covered over a hundred meters distance when his heart churned because ahead of him were pairs of crimson eyes that were viciously staring at him.'Just great, those damn spiders colonize both passages!' Jacob cursed in his heart, but this time he didn't stop.With the long sword in his hand, he entered 3X acceleration. He wanted to charge his way out of this place now.Although it would consume his energy much faster, it was far better than waiting for those spiders to overwhelm him.He wanted to take advantage of his speed and escape this spider nest. As for why he was risking going deeper into the spider nest to escape them, it was pretty simple…Seeing Jacob coming in their way, those spiders shot poison spry and web balls at him.But Jacob nimbly dodges everything and swiftly passes those spiders throwing them in disarray.However, Jacob had just entered a few meters deep into the passage when spider webs blocked his way, and many phantom spiders were eyeing him with bloodlust.Now he was surrounded from front and back.But Jacob suddenly smiled coldly, "A spider nest won't be a spider nest without webs. And all the webs are extremely combustible!"The next moment, a grenade appeared in his hand, and he quickly took out the pin and threw it deep into the passage, and then instantly turned around!Although this would cause a commotion, he knew this was the only way he could advance!Furthermore, he was deep underground and could only hope those dark beings won't get alert by this grenade's explosion. Even if they did, they won't be able to find the location unless they could dig hundreds of meters!As for these spiders, they would be too busy dealing with fire, and he could easily take advantage of this situation and escape their nest!Those spiders naturally had no idea what just Jacob threw as they all chased after him to stop him from escaping.After ten seconds…'Boomm…'An explosion rang in the corridor, raising dust clouding before blood-curdling shrieks started to ring in the corridor.Jacob instantly turned around, and when he saw the passage was now lit in bright light, he knew the entire nest was probably ignited! He ran toward it without hesitation while skillfully dodging the Spider and even cutting them if they got in his way.Now the place was crawling with those mad phantom spiders as they rushed toward him as if they had completely lost their sanity.Jacob had to amid these spiders were simply too many and probably here for a long time.So, he took out another grenade and threw it backward while he entered the sea of flame as all those spiders also started to catch fire because of the hairy respecters on their legs.Everyone was thrown into disarray as the second grenade also blasted amid those spiders chasing after him.The spider web of phantom spiders was as thick as a rope and would be burning for a long time. The temperature of the place instantly rose, turning it into a furnace.At this moment, a cloak suddenly appeared on Jacob, made out of steel threads and highly flame resistant.Jacob quickly saw the end of the aflame passage, which was another cross path, but the right corridor was not ignited in a fire.Furthermore, he noticed that those spiders, despite burning in flames, were not approaching that dark corridor.Which made him somewhat vigilant. Still, he took that path as he wanted to get out of this burning spider nest, and he almost went deaf because of those shrills.Jacob didn't know if he had managed to get the spider queen, but he didn't want to stay to find out.But he was astonished when those spiders didn't follow him in this passage, so he quickly stopped the fluid acceleration and slowed down his speed.Those spiders were avoiding something here and would rather burn than head this way. This was enough of a reason for Jacob to be even more careful.He quickly took out a piece of meat and ate it while, with silent feet, he slowly walked deep into the corridor. The shrills of spiders were getting vague, and the burning corridor was also not turned into a small light spot.'Just what kind of place is this?' Jacob was more curious as he walked while replenishing his energy.Soon, he reached another turn, and now it was complete silence and dark, just like before.Jacob decided to rest for a bit since there was no one, and he wasn't sure what would be waiting for him at the end of this passage.After three hours, Jacob starts walking again with his torch. He could see vaguely in the dark if he heightened his senses, but it was far from night vision.However, Jacob's eyes contracted when he saw the same gloomy light at another turn ahead, and he knew it was the light from the magic torch since it was all over the place.'Could it be those spiders had gotten rid of all the torches in that area? Then what about this corridor?' Jacob stowed his flashlight away and equipped his sniper rifle and sword as he slowly approached the turn.Jacob slowly peered while taking cover in the dimly lit corridor. His eyes narrowed when he saw an open space at the end of this dim corridor.Without making any sounds, he approached the end of the corridor and stopped at the entrance while carefully examining the spacious room in front of him.It was a 20x20 room painted in dark yellow, and in the center of this room was something that made Jacob's heart race.A golden crown embedded in gems was mysteriously hovering in the center of a black altar. Furthermore, a stone head with soft facial features was placed right in the middle of the altar and below the Crown.'Don't tell me…' Jacob instantly looked around, and finally, his eyes landed on the black symbols engraved on the wall straight ahead while the other walls were filled with murals, including the ceiling.'I reached the place of another condition!' Jacob's eyes shone in ecstasy.But his heart suddenly palpitated when his eyes landed on a figure who was almost invisible under the dim light and lying on the west corner.It was a six-meter creature with dark-yellow scales all over its body, and its head was like a T-Rex with a pair of red horns while two red bat wings were folded over his spine and a long crocodile tail filled with sharp red spikes.Its sharp claws were resting under its head. The eyes of this creature were closed as if it was dead, but when a powerful breath escaped its nostrils, almost turning into a low roar, it was quite evident that it was alive and only asleep.Jacob almost forgot to breathe as a fabled creature came into his mind, 'A Wyvern?!'

Chapter 202 New Titan Sniper!
﻿'A Wyvern?!'Jacob felt his scalp tingle in trepidation as he slowly backed away and only stopped after he was completely out of the entrance's view.Jacob finally understood why those spiders didn't dare to wander on this path. It was because of that sleeping Wyvern!His expression was as grim as it could get while he mused, 'What a Wyvern doing in this place? Weren't they in just folklore, or shouldn't exist in rare plains, right? Could it be this thing is the guardian of this place? It's most likely the case.'A wry smile appeared on his cold face, 'How could it be so easy to complete a trial? Moreover, from the Wyvern color, it should be a Fire Wyvern. From folklore, Wyvern belonged to the branch of the mythical Dragon Race, and their scale color represents their element.'Even in my world, Wyvern is as famous as Dragons, and they consider it a lower evolution of a fully-grown dragon. I wonder if this is true in this place as well. Damn, I never thought I would miss that damn book so much. Only it could confirm if this thing is even Wyvern or not!'Jacob calmed himself after a while as his eyes shimmered with uncertainty, 'Let's forget about the Wyvern or whatever that thing is. Since it is sleeping, then it means it is oblivious to my presence yet.'I have to figure out what condition this is. Since I can't understand the runes written there, I have to guess before taking any action.'A crown hovering above a statue head, probably of a female. A crown can easily synonym with a King's dignity since, without a crown, there is no true king. But that female head could also be seen as a Maiden.'The remaining conditions are, Destroy the Dignity of the King and Give the Maiden Hope. If I destroyed that crown, would it result in the completion of the first or second condition? Or what if that crown is supposed to go over that statue's head?'The more Jacob mulled over it, the more he felt he was missing something, and he knew that the riddle on the wall was what he was missing. Then there was still that sleeping disaster which would definitely not remain sleeping if someone tried to approach the crown or clear the condition.'What to do? Try assassinating that sleeping thing?'Killing intent flashed past Jacob's eyes as he knew it was a rare chance to sneak attack that Wyvern, and once it was gone, he could try to study those murals since they were also there for a reason.'But what if my bullet didn't pierce through that Wyvern's skull? It would only antagonize it, and it might go on a rampage, and I would be like a trapped rat in these corridors unless I can outrun it….' Jacob's mind raced as he contemplated his options.'Or I can draw those dark beings into this passage by explosions and let them fight with this Wyvern. But if this weren't a Wyvern and only some weak creature, then I would have to deal with those high-level dark beings, which would be even more difficult.'They might've already discovered the position of another condition, and if they find a way to clear both of them, then all my effort will go down the drain…' Jacob inhaled sharply before resolution shimmered in his icy cold eyes, 'Well, without risk there is no reward, let see if I can slay a Wyvern or not with this new Titan Sniper!'The next moment, Jacob approached the corridor again, and when he was only a meter away from the space, he stopped.He flipped his hand, and a three-meter-long, three-legged sniper stand appeared in his hands. The legs of this sniper stand were 1.1 meters thick each!Without making a sound, he set it right where the entrance was, and the Wyvern was in clear view. But its footing was still shallow, and Jacob didn't want to take the risk of digging because of the sleeping Wyvern, so he had to do with it.The next moment, a two-meter-long sniper body appeared, which was pitch black with a dark gray trigger and sniper grip. The sniper's body was even larger than him and as wide as him.It literally looked like a freaking cannon!He then carefully set the rifle body on top of the stand and then locked it with those locks, and only when it was completely affixed did he take out the barrel!The barrel was five meters in size and as thick as the barrel of a tank but far more refined. He then carefully assembled the barrel before taking out the final part, a multi-hole muzzle two meters long.This new sniper rifle had cost Jacob his entire fortune; he even had to sell the star watches to create this beast. This rifle was far deadlier than the old titan sniper rifle he created in the common plains.Furthermore, he can't shoot a bullet from it while holding it because of the terrifying recoil. That's why he needed that stand which was also made with titan iron.He had made it to hunt Extraordinary-Tier-6 beings from a far distance, but he never thought he would stumble into dark ruins.Now, this Wyvern was blocking his way, so he had no choice but to take out this Titan Rifle, and since it was sleeping, Jacob was even more confident in killing it with a single shot from this close!Jacob didn't need to set the scoop as he stood behind the large sniper rifle, held the grip, and took the shooting stance while he eyed the sleeping prey without breathing.After adjusting it a little and when the muzzle perfectly aligned with the Wyvern's closed eyes, a large black magazine filled with ten bullets appeared in Jacob's other hand.The bullet was completely black because it was made with titan iron and a special gunpowder crafted by Jacob. The bullet size was 40 mm Caliber, which was literally a cannon bullet!He only had five more such bullets except those in the magazine, and each bullet cost him 500 million in gold coins!Jacob then slowly attacked the magazine and loaded the bullet with a cold click.At this moment, Jacob's heartbeat started to climb at an insane rate… 1X… 3X… 6X acceleration!At this moment, his skin was bead red, and veins bulged all over his body. Even his eyes went bloodshot. But his breath was as calm as a lake.The next moment, Jacob's finger on the trigger moved!The Wyvern, who seemed to be in a deep slumber, suddenly opened its reptile eyes and instantly locked on the muzzle. It felt its life was threatened all of a sudden!It had opened its eyes just at the right time because Jacob had pulled the trigger, and despite entering 6x acceleration, he felt his shoulder bone break and the stand just barely able to do its job.However, his eyes didn't leave the target!The Wyvern couldn't even react, and the bullet was already upon him!'Splash…'With wide open eyes filled with confusion and daze, it felt a thunderous pain in its head before that pain faded as well as the light in its sights.There was a huge hole in its skull, and crimson blood was gushing out of it with its brain matter.'Boommm…'A sonic boom suddenly rang at this moment. Despite the suppression, it nearly blasted half of the corridor!Jacob was barely able to hold his ground because of the 6x acceleration.Despite the trickling blood from the corner of his lips, a hint of a smile was apparent on his face as he looked at the dead Wyvern, which he slew in one headshot.But when he looked at the hole in the skull and that instantly fast bullet failed to blast its head off or pierce through its skull, he felt chills.Because this means the scales on this guy's body were far more resistible and harder than he had imagined, and that bullet was able to kill it because of its speed and rare titan iron.Or if he had used a common titan bullet, he might only put a scratch on its head!Nevertheless, since the creature was dead, it no longer mattered.Jacob then focused on calming down his heart rate, but that broken shoulder was making it hard for him to focus as he was on the verge of entering 7x acceleration.Then he had no choice but to take out the only 100-milliliter vial of rare titan tears he had managed to create with the reaming titan iron. He then consumed 10 ml as he finally felt warm energy start to fill his body, and the pain started to subdue.After an hour, he finally calmed down, and his shoulder was more than half-mended. He then ate the reaming meat he had of crock snake and was able to move.He first disassembled the titan rifle and stowed it away. The entire rifle covered too much area of his pendant.Then he finally moved toward the Wyvern with burning eyes as if he was looking at a feast!

Chapter 203 Clues And Final Decision!
﻿Approaching the corpse of Wyvern, Jacob couldn't help but feel a lingering oppressive aura from the carcass.Despite knowing, it was dead, Jacob still felt his fine hair standing because of that oppressive aura.'This thing had to be an Extraordinary-Tier-6 at least!' Jacob presumed as he looked at the shining scales as his eyes shimmered with ecstasy, 'Whatever its rank might be, just its skin is priceless in rare plains. No, the entire body of a Wyvern should be a treasure, even blood!'Without wasting any time, Jacob sprang into action and turned around the body upside down, revealing the red stomach of the Wyvern. He knew if he wanted to cut it open, the only way was from the softest part of the body.He wasn't confident in cutting it with any of his blades, especially from its scaly skin, which was thought enough not to blow up by a bullet fired from titan iron!Jacob then made a cut with full strength around its neck cavity as he took out an empty water gallon and filled it with the creature's fiery blood. He was shocked when he felt the blood temperature which was almost at a boiling point.Jacob had read about the magic beast's blood used in alchemy, and if the magic beast were an extraordinary tier, then the blood would be more precious. Many Alchemists would pay a high price for such a creature's blood.Not to mention if this was a Fire Wyvern, then that makes its blood even more precious and rare.Jacob filled three such gallons, which were previously filled with water!After storing the gallons, he gutted the creature and carefully removed the skin, which was probably the most precious and perfect material to make armor.It took him twelve hours to fully dismembered the Wyvern, and he stored marble-like meat, lungs, heart, and anything eatable to his pendant. Even its giant head wasn't spared since those teeth and skull were also precious materials to make blades.The space was filled with the potent smell of blood, but Jacob was completely unfazed.With ecstasy, Jacob was holding a crystal red orb that was as big as his fist, and it was glowing in nine bright white spots like a crystal ball with real stars in it.It was a Nine-Star Fire Element Core and was at the peak of nine stars at that!Jacob could feel terrifying fiery energy concentrated in this orb, and even while holding it, he could feel this vibrant energy wanting to burn his skin. Those common-tier species won't be able to touch this magic core!Now, there was no doubt that he had managed to kill an Extraordinary-Tier-6 with a single headshot.After admiring the magic core, he stowed it away. Although it won't dissipate like a one- or two-star magic core in minutes, it would still lose all its element energy if it is left alone in the open for a long.Now, he was done with the dismembering, and the floor was filled with blood and gore and arteries of Wyvern. He finally turned his focus on the real prize!Jacob approached the hovering crown and statue head in the center. He paid much attention to the stone head, which was skillfully carved, and it was no doubt the face of a beautiful woman.However, now that he looked closely at the head, he saw there was a deep cut over her lips, or it might be because the head was attacked by a sharp object like a knife at some time.But seeing the perfectly fine condition of the rest of the head, he doubted that someone with the intent to destroy it would only leave after leaving a small cut over the lips.He stopped a meter away from the altar, didn't dare to touch anything, and only observed it from each side.Jacob knew he lacked the crucial clue written on that wall, and if he triggered something without an understanding of this place, he might not get another chance at this.So, after examining the crown and the status head, he moved toward the murals, which were the only thing that could shed some light on which condition it was.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ On the left wall, there are three scenes recorded.The first one was a chariot drawn by horses, and a person pointing his spear toward an army of men could be seen. The most noteworthy thing was that the person pointing its spear was actually wearing the same crown hovering in the room.This would make him the owner of that crown, the King!The next scene has recorded as a banquet, and the King is standing over a high platform while holding a wine glass, this time instead of a spear. In the last scene, the King sits over his throne while a radiating sun and dark moon are inscribed on the left and right.Jacob frowned and thought, 'Although I'm not an expert at this, it is quite clear that the King has won some battle, and the banquet is probably a celebration banquet. Lastly, he was shown ruling over everything. Sun and moon mostly symbolized the Life and Death cycle in most ancient cultures. But I can't be sure about this world.'Jacob was quite familiar with anything that symbolized life and death because of his mad search to prolong his life. He had seen many ancient records which were remotely related to immortality.He then walked toward the other wall, which also had three scenes.In the first scene, someone was kneeling before the King on his throne. In the second, there was still the same scene, but eight spear-holding persons were added to it, as well as King was showing, pointing his finger at the kneeling figure.In the last scene, which was the most interesting of all, in here, a black-dressed woman appeared beside the King's throne, and her hand was precisely attached to the King's Crown!If the other wall shows the glorying of the King, then this wall shows some kind of memorial of the throne room.Jacob frowned because there was no record of what happened afterward.'Now there are three key figures, the King, the kneeling figure, and that woman grabbing the crown.'If I assumed the kneeling figure is the maiden, then that stone head should be her since there are weaponized guards and the King is pointing his finger at her.'But the woman grabbing the crown is also more than qualified enough to behead because of her bold action of grabbing the crown as that head could be her as well.'Yet, I can't imagine her being the maiden since a maiden represents someone who is pure and without any malice. So how could she grab the King's crown?'Jacob then looked toward the ceiling to find some more clues about what happened after she grabbed the crown. He knew he was quite close to getting the clear picture.However, he was disappointed because there was another battle scene on the ceiling.But this time, Jacob was shocked that the King was fighting in the same chariot. There were skeletons figures recorded on the enemy side while a black sun was behind the enemy side, and a white moon was on the King's army side.'Don't tell me those skeletons represent Dark Beings?' Jacob couldn't help but feel it was highly possible.Because Dark Being existed as long as the living, and they are enemies of any living beings. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to find dark beings hundreds of thousands of years in the past.But the end result of this battle was also not shown, which made Jacob grimace to no end. The only thing left was the riddle on the wall, which Jacob had no clue how to solve.'Should I try to put the crown on the statue's head?' Jacob gravely looked at the crown again, 'But what if the whole place crushes down the moment I do it or even touch it? Or I got some ancient curse by touching it? Even poisoning is not out of option… should I try destroying it? There is only a 1% chance that nothing will happen.'No matter what he thought about, he couldn't decide what to do since every path led to a dangerous outcome. In contrast, getting rid of a living Wyvern was way easier.Jacob then again looked at the wall with the kneeling figure and woman touching the crown. He knew the answer was in this mural, and he just needed to figure it out.After looking for a while, Jacob suddenly jolted as his eyes grew shaper and shaper while his eyes were affixed to the hand touching the crown.'She touched the crown; then she got beheaded? Then it is more likely that I need to destroy the crown without touching it or removing it from its place. I'm 60% sure that this is about destroying dignity, not giving anyone hope.'The woman's action could also be seen as destroying the King's dignity, but she got destroyed in the end…!'

Chapter 204 The Start Of Mayhem (1)
﻿In the east wing of the ruined castle, there was another courtyard like the one Jacob discovered.At this moment, inside the worship room with a broken statue of a priest's skeleton.Five black-clad figures were looking at a hologram map projected of the star watch of a 1.9-meter-tall person."Team Leader, are you sure this place is abandoned and no dark beings are patrolling this area?" Skull No. A-501's whispered in a grave tone. After he revealed the Killer Skull Society's ability to hold those dark beings back for ten years in the secret trial space in the castle, the other freedom lords had no choice but to comply with their demands since it was a matter of countless lives and their entire heritage.So, with Skull No. A-501, a team of five, was formed to infiltrate the castle through a secret passage the Golden Swords Freedom Lord had discovered by accident which led straight inside the outer castle.This team's job was to reach the secret room and then figure out how to clear the condition there in ten years, or they will naturally die horribly from the enraged dark beings.However, this task was much easier said than done because they needed to reach that place in one piece before they could use the secret trump card of killer skull society.But more importantly, they needed to draw the attention of the Lich King and the Wight Minister. At least they needed to draw away the Lich King from the secret room, or these five won't be enough, and they would die before they could even step inside that room.That's why the Dark Annihilation Army will launch an all-out attack. Even Freedom Lords will participate in it, so Lich King had no choice but to leave the castle since Lich Minister and two Dark Knights weren't enough to hold back more than one freedom lord.Meanwhile, these five had to figure out how to reach their destination before the Dark Beings could determine their true motives.These five were highly proficient in stealth arts, and the Team Leader was a mysterious existence from the Ice Nation called the Maroon Assassin, selected by the Golden Sword Freedom Lord himself.Maroon Assassin's face was hidden behind a metal mask, and his eyes were also hidden behind an obscure lens in his mask. He coldly replied, hearing No.501's question in his harsh voice, "Are you questioning Lord Golden Swords' words and my ability?"No.501 felt a chill run down his spine as if a hunter stared at him and quickly replied briskly, "Team Leader, I'm just concerned that's all because if we fail, we won't get another chance. Please forgive me if I offended you."Maroon Assassin coldly stated, "If you're afraid of death, then hand over the item and the usage method and then scram. We'll do it on our own. You are only here because of the person behind you, and if you slow us down, I'll be the first one to get rid of you!"The other three remain stoic without saying anything since they are all terrifying figures, while No.501 is only an Extraordinary-Tier-2 among them. He was only here because the 'item' and its usage matter were only known to him.So, they can't get rid of them either for now.But this didn't mean they would let this guy push them around. This mission was critical, and they were under strict orders to eliminate any threat.They were even allowed to kill 501 if he appeared to be a nuisance and then bring back that item without exposing this passage.However, if he cooperated, they were not allowed to touch him, and they knew better than their fates were also dependent on this, or they didn't mind killing him and then confiscating the item."Please do your thing Team Leader. I'll keep my mouth shut." No.501 didn't speak anymore, but a hint of viciousness flashed past his eyes, 'Hmph, once I get into that room, I'll let you know what real arrogance is!'Maroon Assassin then didn't pay any attention to him either and kept looking at the scanning hologram map.After ten minutes, a miniature map appeared with lots of blue dots.Maroon Assassin coldly looked at the four and said, "All these blue dots are undead, and as you can see, there are over hundreds of them in five hundred meters around us."Our mission is to distract them all while causing a massive commotion before the army attack starts and draw Lich King out."I want you four to set up explosives in these areas where there is no undead. Remember this map well. I'll be going deeper to set explosive where the sane zombies are."We only had one chance, so I don't want any of you to mess up, or I'll be the first one to come after you. Is that clear?"The four gravely nodded under Maroon Assassin's piercing gaze!---Back to the secret underground room,After deciding to try destroying the crown, Jacob didn't take immediate action and first sat down to replenish his energy.He didn't was any misshape to happen if something went wrong.He also ate the Wyvern meat, which was as hard as rubber, but he felt like an energy blast had gone ablaze in his body when he consumed it.Just eating half a pound gave Jacob as much energy as the entire vial of rare titan tears he currently had, or even more.Furthermore, there was a strange heat energy in that meat which would've burned his organs without his powerful digesting ability.'So, this is the meat of a peak extraordinary specie.' Jacob wiped a slight blood from the corner of his lips as they curled up.Despite feeling like his body was on fire, he was feeling full of vitality and strength. He knew he didn't have to worry about consuming his energy and then won't be able to replenish it for a while now. Which simply means he could go wild if he wanted to!Jacob then started to use that excess energy to practice the next level of fluid acceleration. He wasn't in a hurry anymore.This place was still safe, and even if someone discovered it, those spiders would be the first ones to notice if any of them still hadn't burned yet.After meditating for an entire day, Jacob finally opened his eyes which were filled with fiery vitality and coldness as he looked at the hovering crown.He stood up, and a long silver sword appeared in his hand as he made his way toward the crown.He stopped a meter away from the crown, and his heartbeat started to rise while he tightly gripped the sword's hilt.Jacob wanted to finish it with a single blow because he was afraid that something might happen if he couldn't destroy the crown in a single blow.Furthermore, he was going to destroy the head underneath as well, just to be saved. Because there was another possibility that this head should be the Queen, and a Queen could also be considered a King's Dignity.So, he just wanted to make sure he won't leave any room for error.Lastly, if he was wrong, he could only run and find the last condition.He didn't know what would happen if someone destroyed a conditioned place without knowing what to do, but he was certain that it might never be restored or those dark beings won't be waiting for 400 years to clear the already found condition.With 6X acceleration, Jacob held the sword with both hands and held it high in a slashing position before he hacked the blade down as it vibrated through the air and turned into a silver streak.'Boommmm…'A piercing sound suddenly reverberated in the entire corridor before the eerie sound of glass shattering by a sharp object rang.The moment Jacob's sword landed on the crown, he was shocked because the hovering crown remained infective for a moment as cracks started to appear on it, and like glass, it shattered, and his sword landed on the statue head below.However, the moment the sword touched the stone statue, it bound back, sending Jacob flying toward the mural wall!Jacob was barely able to avoid the powerful impact and landed on his feet. He looked at the statue's head with astonishment while his hands felt numb.But his eyes dilated when he saw the broken pieces of crown suddenly trembling on the ground, and the next moment thereafter, they turned into gold dust.The gold dust seemed attracted by a mysterious force and started gathering around the statue's head.Under Jacob's baffled eyes, the gold dust started to take shape around the head of this statue.When the shape was finished, he was even more amazed because the gold dust was shaped into the same crown he had just destroyed, and now it started to congeal!

Chapter 205 The Start Of Mayhem (2)
﻿Jacob looked at the statue's head with uncertainty in his eyes because of the newly congealed golden crown resting over its head.But he didn't have the time to mull over it because of the sudden tremor, and the entire underground foundation started to shake, just like what happened when he cleared the first condition.Suddenly, Jacob's attention was drawn by the cracking sound toward the right, which was the wall with the riddle.Under his astonished eyes, a passage cracked open, and he could see old stone stairs going downward.'How convenient…' His lips curled up.But before taking the passage, he quickly tried to grab the crown over the statue's head. Since the condition was clear, then it won't be dangerous anymore.Since this crown was reformed, then this means it probably had some other uses, just like the flower he got after he cleared the first condition.However, to Jacob's surprise, the moment he tried picking up the crown, the statue's head got lifted with it as if both of them were now attacked together.'Well, what the hell.' Jacob didn't mind as he stowed away the crowned statue head.The tremor was getting violent as the cracks started to appear around the room. Jacob knew he didn't have time, so he flashed toward the newly open passage. He was still in 6x acceleration, so his speed was akin to an extraordinary-tier-3.---The entire Dark Ruins was experiencing violent tremors at this moment.Inside the secret underground room where the throne and the headless kneeling figure were.The Wight Minister was trembling while prostrating on the floor in front of the Lich King, who was emitting an ice-chilling ghostly aura as a dark blue flame was ignited over his menacing helmet."Tell me, Wight Minister, this tremor is not what I think it is?" The dark blue flame suddenly rose as Lich King questioned with a hint of madness in his voice.Wight Minister trembled violently despite the tremor fading away. He was afraid of dying right now because he knew the Lich King was completely enraged right now, and immeasurable bloodlust was leaking from his very being.Before Wight Minister could answer, right at this moment,"Boomm…. Boommm... Boom…"Explosions started to ring above the castle, and they were so high pitch the voice could be heard deep down there."Those livestocks don't know their place!" The Lich King furiously roared, which was more like an eerie shrill filled with mad wrath.The Lich King vanished from his position giving Wight Minister a new lease on life."I need to figure out this damn riddle, or I won't be able to live if another shackle was broken by those hateful ants!" Wight Minister mumbled as blue flames within his eyes flickered madly.---At this moment, somewhere in the outer castle.The team of five was hiding in an empty room.With a hoarse voice, one of them asked, "What was that tremor just now?""A shackle had been broken!" Maroon Assassin stated in a foreboding voice."What?! Could it be we are already too late?" Skull No. A-501 palely questioned."I don't know, but there is a 90% chance of its being the same shackle within the palace. Furthermore, our time bombs were also gone off at a very terrible time, and if I'm not wrong, the lords might abandon the attack plan after finding out the shackle was broken. There is no meaning in sacrificing our manpower anymore." The Maroon Assassin stated grimly."Then what about us?" A female voice sounded with a hint of nervousness."Since the shackle is broken, there is no need to stay here any longer, and we are on our own to retreat now!" Maroon Assassin coldly stated."But we are already this deep into the castle, and the areas we blow up too close to the hidden passage, and if the lords are not coming to distract the Lich King, then we will be sitting ducks for him to slaughter!" Skull No. A-501 ruefully stated.However, at this moment, the Maroon Assassin suddenly said something which sent everyone into the abyss of despair."Heh, this is indeed the case; if all five of us go back, that's why you guys should just stay here forever!"The next moment, before the other four could react, Maroon Assassin's hand suddenly surrounded by the wind before turning into a windy blade and flashing past those four throats!---In the outermost area of the Dark Runes.The Dark Annihilation Army was garrisoning this place while the potent smell of blood and blood scattered around.Large piles of dark beings' corpses were in the west of these camps.There were also natives of freedom plains corpses which were also piled in the rear of the army camps as some soldiers were burning them on high command's order.It was evident that there was a huge fight not long ago in this place. The Dark Annihilation Army had earned itself this foothold in Dark Ruins after scarifying over 10,000 troops.However, they also killed over 10,000 dark beings under Lich Minister's command, so the exchange was equal.At this moment, in a huge camp, ten people clad in armor were sitting around a table with grim expressions.The Golden Swords Freedom Lord, as well as another Giant figure who wore crimson armor with spiky shoulder guards and long black dreadlock hair, and a menacing mask, was also present in this place. It was the Crimson War Freedom Lord!The Golden Swords Freedom Lord gravely spoke, "As everyone might already have guessed, I'm afraid another shackle had been broken a few minutes ago. Since it was broken before we could start the operation, then it would be safe to assume that the Dark Beings had broken the shackle in the castle."This means the stealth team is now on their own, and we'll need to turn our focus to finding the other shackle. The advantage we had before is now gone, so I don't need to tell everyone what is at stake here, right?"A masked person with blue fur on his hands suddenly spoke with a hint of panic, "Then what about the item in 501's possession? If he abandons them, then doesn't it mean that item will also be lost if they won't able to come out?"This person was another Skull, the commander of Skull Kingdom's Army Unit, No. A-502.He never expected their plan would go into smoke even before it started, which was a massive blow to their future plans.Furthermore, the item that Skull No. A-501 was carrying was even more precious and one of the killer skull society's trump cards in rare plains, and losing it would definitely make No. A-0 went berserk."Is your measly item more important than our current predicament where all of our lives are at stake?!" A golden elf berated coldly."Measly item? How about you throw your Life Points into the gutter and then try saying the same!" No. A-502 retorted without holding back."Bastard, you dare to profane Holy Water! Supreme Lord, please let me kill this profaner!" The golden elf instantly stood up while his hand was tightly on the sword hilt around his belt.The Holy Water was the most sacred object of Golden Elves, and just one drop of it could cure any illness or curse and increase someone's lifespan by ten years!pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ That's why it was known as Life Potion by everyone. But elves won't give to anyone no matter what the price, as they consider it a blessing granted to them by the World Tree of myths!Even Golden Swords Freedom Lords went icy, but he knew this wasn't the time to dispute, and that item was really equivalent to ten drops of Holy Water, so No. A-502 anger and panic were justifiable."Enough with your retard talks!" At this moment, the Crimson War Freedom Lord's icy voice boomed into everyone's ears, almost deafening them!Everyone looked toward the giant with a hint of fear.Many feared Giants, and they were killing machines if they went on a rampage, so no one wanted to offend them. And this person was probably the strongest giant because he was called the First Freedom Lord for this exact reason, strength!"You have something to add, First Lord?" Golden Swords Freedom Lord's eyes shifted to the giant as he didn't dare to mess with this guy."It's simple, I'm going to kill that Lich Bastard (Lich King), and I need you to hold back those underlings. Can you do that?" The Crimson War Freedom Lord coolly stated as if it was a trifling matter while looking at the Golden Swords Freedom Lord.However, before Golden Swords Freedom Lord could reply, a terrifying aura suddenly descent before they heard eerie roars and powerful footsteps marching; the ground was rumbling.Lich King's wrathful voice rang in the entire Dark Ruins at this moment,"Cunning livestock, forfeit your lives!"

Chapter 206 The Last Hurdle
﻿After Jacob entered the underground staircase, the passage behind started to crumble, and it only stopped when there was nothing left.However, the for some reason, the staircase passage was completely fine, and when he was a few meters deep, he received another message in his star watch from an unknown source."You have received the Irony of the King."Jacob scoffed inwardly, 'First, the blessing of the priest and now the irony of the king. What a peculiar way to tell you have succeeded!'Jacob then stopped paying attention to the star watch and headed deep within the passage. After walking fifty meters down the stairs, he finally saw a touch ahead.The passage was three meters high, two meters wide, and made with large stone bricks.As Jacob moved down, he finally saw the end after heading two hundred meters deep underground.It was another wall, and he assumed that this wall should be just like the hoax wall in the secret rooms.So, he took out his sword and tried to open a small hole to see what was on the other side instead of just barging.However, when he tried piercing his sword, he found that it was probably a real wall, not a hoax. Still, he used his strength to dig a small hole, and after piercing one meter deep into the wall, his sword finally managed to reach the other side.Jacob then looked through the hole, and he only saw a wall like the passage he was already in, nothing else.So, he decided to make the hole bigger, and when he was finally able to see the other side, he was astonished because there was another staircase going downward.'Now, where am I?' Jacob thoughtfully looked at the staircase, which led downward as well as going upward. He was probably in the middle of a hidden passage built behind this stairway.Since there was no one or any movement, he made a hole big enough for himself to crawl out of it. But he avoids making any noises because this place might as well be some cellar in the innermost castle, and outside might be extraordinary dark beings. Jacob silently landed on the stairway, and after thinking for a moment, he decided to head down to see if there was some kind of hidden storage room. He might get some unexpected loot, like in the temple's secret room.The passage was just like the one he had appeared from; there were torches around to make it visible.Without making any noise, he headed down, and when he was on his 100th step, he finally saw an opening. But that opening reminded him of the corridor opening which led toward the secret room with the crown.'Don't tell me this passage opened right toward another condition?!' Jacob didn't dare to believe it, but still, he felt anticipation.But he also remembered the Wyvern sleeping in that place, so he didn't dare to make noises even more and slowly crept toward the opening.When Jacob was only ten meters away from the opening, he stopped because he could hear slow footsteps ahead, and his expression turned grave.'There is someone else there?' Jacob didn't dare to move forward, afraid that the other party would see him.But after the footsteps moved for five or six seconds, they were stopped and no longer moved. Jacob also increased his hearing, but he couldn't hear any heartbeat or breathing, which made him even more vigilant.Since there was no more movement and no shadow ahead, he descended two more steps to see what was inside and the person.Jacob then squatted and lowered his head like a sneaking thief to see a barely visible room. However, it was enough to make Jacob almost swear with joy.Because the space ahead looked exactly like two spaces he couldn't be more familiar with.This place was slightly bigger than the crown room, and in the center of this room was a large stone throne and a stone statue sat on this throne.In front of this Stone Throne was another headless statue kneeling.Jacob's eyes instantly landed on the runes inscribed on the walls right ahead and some of the visible murals.Jacob knew he had really appeared right where the last condition was but what made him apprehensive was the ragged cloak tall figure standing right behind the throne and looking at the runes without moving.'A Dark Being!' Jacob didn't need to think about the identity because this place was likely to be the place that was under Dark Beings' monitoring.So, that cloaked figure should be as strong as the Lich Minister he saw that day. The only good news was the Lich King wasn't anywhere to be seen.But Jacob's expression fell when he thought about the huge hole in the middle of the stairway, and if Lich King or any dark being came back, it would be over for him!There would be no place for him to hide at that time since he would be under the siege of hundreds of dark beings. He shuddered just thinking about it.'I need to get rid of that guy before dealing with this place as soon as possible!' Jacob's eyes were filled with decisiveness, 'Since he is standing there like a statue, I won't get another chance to sneak up on him!'Jacob knew he had to react quickly since he could get exposed at any moment. He crept toward the room, and without arousing Wight Minister's attention, Jacob entered the room as his heart rate, and breathing were extremely low.The Wight Minister was only 15 meters away from him, but Jacob felt like it was fifteen miles as he took tiny steps toward the Wight Minister, who seemed to be deep in thought while looking at the riddle.After the two conditions were broken, Wight Minister wanted to solve this riddle quickly, or he knew it would be his turn when the Lich King returned after venting on the freedom plains army.So, Jacob's presence goes completely unnoticed by Wight Minister, whose mind was solely focused on figuring out how to live until…!

Chapter 207 Fighting Wight Minister (1)
﻿Wight Minister suddenly sensed something amiss as the flames within his empty sockets flickered fiercely before a dark translucent barrier appeared right above his clocked head.'Swish…'The very next moment, a powerful gust of sharp wind hail as a long silver blade stuck on the dark barrier, but it didn't manage to break through it."Indigenous ant!" Wight Minister hollered as his skeleton finger shimmered in a dark glow before he waved his hand right toward the attack creating a dark arc!Jacob was shocked by his sneak attack being blocked by this dark energy and was completely caught off guard as he was still in midair. Because he had jump-attacked the Wight Minister since he was standing right behind the throne, going from any side would've easily exposed him.If he had taken his time by setting up the titan rifle, he would've been exposed by the slightest sound, and his decision to sneak up on the Wight Minister was completely right. He also had no other gun that could kill an extraordinary dark being.But he never thought Wight Minister would react so quickly, and before his sword could hack into his skull, he blocked it. He was in 6X acceleration right now, which means his previous attack had probably 3-kiloton, but this energy barrier was able to block it!Jacob didn't have time to mull over it as the dark energy blade was already upon him, and he quickly used the silver sword to block it. But the power behind it was tremendous, probably close to 5-Kiloton, and Jacob was sent flying toward the mural as the silver blood also lost a chuck of it.Wight Minister finally turned toward Jacob, who quickly stabilized himself while leaving a small crater on the mural wall.Wight Minister looked at Jacob's cold amber eyes behind his mask as the flames in his eyes flickered sinisterly.Jacob felt his skin crawling as he looked at those blue flame eyes and couldn't help but utter, "What nasty thing are you?"Wight Minister scoffed in the language of the living, "With this meager power, you dare to sneak attack me?! Know you place ant and turn into life crystal!"Jacob felt his heart palpitate when a crimson blade sword with a bone hilt magically appeared in the Wight Minister's hand.The very next moment, the crimson blade started to shimmer in dark sheen, and Wight Minister took a step forward, turning into a dark blur!Jacob knew he was in danger as the fine hair on his neck stood, and without hesitation, he entered 7X acceleration!Thereafter, he moved his sword to the left side just in time before the crimson sword was about to slice off his head. But he still took a heavy blow and, like a rag doll, was sent flying toward the entrance wall."Oh? Did you block it? Your power seemed to spike all of a sudden." Wight Minister was standing right where Jacob was while holding his crimson sword as he looked at Jacob with a hint of dark interest as if he was looking at an interesting ant.On the other hand, Jacob coughs blood as he pulls himself out of the wall rubble. He looked at Wight Minister with killing intent and a hint of fear. That attack had jumbled his organs, and his right arm was fractured.It was his first time getting injured like this and falling into such a disadvantageous situation.As he stood up, he felt the sense of death suddenly envelop him, and without even thinking, his heart rate jumped into 8X accretion, and he used the short sword to block the crimson blade glowing in a dark sheen, which was inches away from piercing his heart.Thereby, he barely managed to block another fatal blow, but the force behind this attack was even stronger than before. It almost created a large hole in the wall, and his ribs were also crushed.Furthermore, the short titan sword was now filled with cracks because of the last blow. But it was the least of Jacob's worries as the mask on his face fell, and he vomited a huge amount of blood with pieces of his bones mixed within.Lastly, his heart rate was completely going out of his control as it was on the verge of cross 9X acceleration.Wight Minister's flaming eyes burn brightly within the dusk cloud like a sinter ghost as if he could see Jacob clearly."You again blocked it, and your power spiked again almost at the Extraordinary-Tier-5. I had never seen or heard of such an ability holder among you living ants, nor did you match any of the threats in our database." Wight Minister uttered with a hint of interest and had no intention of killing him instantly anymore as if he was a specimen.Wight Minister coldly uttered, "Tell me, little ant, what kind of ability you have? If it intrigued me, I should let you be reborn as a Dark Being!" With an ashen face, Jacob coldly looked at Wight Minister with indignation, 'I guess I become arrogant after achieving continuous successions and finally bite more than I can clew. But did this ass-bones really think he had won?'As his heart rate entered 9X acceleration, Jacob felt a warm current in his body as he felt his entire body was burning. Despite his condition, there was no pain, only the feeling of burning.He suddenly said with his lips curled upward, "Ass-bones, I shall thank you for giving me a wake-up call. As a token of my appreciation, you can have this gift!"Wight Minister's eyes flicked with disdain as he saw Jacob moving his only hand, which wasn't broken, toward his face and couldn't help but mock, "Heh, it seemed I had inflicted some damage on your brain. But, no worries, after I…."However, his speech came to an abrupt halt as the flames in his empty sockets enlarged when a pitch-black weapon in Jacob's hand and a terrifying thought appeared in his mind.But before Wight Minister could react, Jacob had pulled the trigger with this mocking sneer on his ashen face as he was saying, 'You are dead!'

Chapter 208 Fighting Wight Minister (2)
﻿The moment Jacob pulled the trigger, without the holder or barrel, he endured the full force behind the titan sniper in his current state.The moment the bullet left the prime barrel, Jacob's entire arm shattered, but just in the nick of time, he managed to stow the gun away into the infinity pendant before his entire arm tore off and the shock wave killed him.As for what happened to the gun after storing it in the infinity pendant like this, he had two theories about it.The first, it would remain the same as it was stored like everything else, and the next time he brought it out, it would appear the same, and he had to deal with the reaming recoil like a time stop.Second, the infinity pendant could not stop time, and the recoil will still happen in the pendant space, which would destroy all the things stored in his storage space, which was completely fine with him, or the infinity pendant would fully suppress the recoil as if nothing happened.Whichever happens, it won't affect the mad thrill in Jacob's eyes as he looked at the Wight Minister, who had his dark barrier in front of him, which was yet to fade.But in this barrier was a huge hole on the top, showing only the jaw bones of Wight Minister as the rest of the head was missing, and only three flames were hovering in its place!Two of the flames were light blue, the eyes of the Wight Minister, while the last one between these two flames was a purple flame, wrapping a black crystal. However, 1/5th of this dark crystal was missing!Soon, the purple dead flame burned brightly before emerald crystals suddenly appeared around the broken core!Jacob's ecstatic expression turned dark and pale as he saw those emerald crystals start to turn into emerald mist which was compelling toward the broken core!"Don't even think about it!" Jacob cursed as he moved his other hand, which still did not completely mingle as an automatic assault rifle appeared in his hand.This also means the recoiled didn't happen!But Jacob had far more pressing matters to deal with; he had to stop this terrifying bastard who clearly wanted to repair his core and revive with those emerald crystals.He had heard about the ability of dark beings to revive as long as their dead flames weren't extinguished, but he had never heard of a dark being who could still be revived after someone damaged the cores so severely!The only relief was Wight Minister seemed to be completely vulnerable in this state as he didn't seem to move despite those two flames flickering in aghast!Wight Minister had never thought that Jacob would have storage space, and on top of that, he had a weapon that could damage his 9-star dark core, much less blow his face off.If he had known, he would never have stopped for chitchat and killed Jacob right there and then when he had the chance, but now, it was too late.Jacob was already in 10X acceleration as he felt like his entire body was melting, and he looked just like a skeleton warrior with skin and veins attached to him right now.But this acceleration also healed half of his right arm, and without even caring about it, Jacob pulled the trigger of the automatic assault rifle as a torrent of bullets landed on the dark core one after another.He knew that as long as he disrupted the process, the Wight Minister would surely die because if not, he was dead!After twenty or so bullets, the core couldn't take it anymore, and dead flame suddenly burned brightly before the cracks started to appear all over the dark core.Jacob felt a terrifying force all of a sudden, 'This suborned motherfucker!'He quickly switched the rifle with the titan tears vial, and without even opening the lid, he tossed it into his mouth and swallowed it!'Booommm…'Jacob was barely able to take out a protective shield when the dark core finally exploded and enveloped Jacob completely!The entire secret room shook because of it, and the voice was even louder. Despite being in the eyes of the explosion, Jacob was still conscious as he felt a warm current in his stomach and even sharp pain. His acceleration was infinitely close to 11X; because of it, the titan tears quickly changed into vitality and gave him some power to collect himself.Furthermore, Jacob didn't want to fall unconscious right in this place, or he would be as good as dead, and the beings on the upper floor might already hear that explosion. He was terrified of the Lich King coming down and ending him.Jacob knew after he barely managed to kill the Wight Minister that he was no match for frontal confrontation with an Extraordinary-Tier-6 being. The Wyvern was just a lucky break, nothing else.With extreme difficulty, he cleared the rubble on himself, and the only relief was that the underground room hadn't come down yet.He could finally crawl out of the rubble, as the entire entrance was blocked because of the explosion.Jacob looked at the center of the secret room and was relieved when he saw the statues survived even after that explosion. He then took out meat blocks he had prepared of Wyvern and swallowed them one after another.Color started to return to his bony face as his wounds were mending rapidly. Even his shattered arm started to mend slowly.But instead of being happy, Jacob was in a hurry. Even his fluid acceleration was ignored by him, and he was barely keeping it at 10X while carefully looking at the kneeling headless statue.At this moment, he suddenly heard footsteps with his enhanced hearing, and he knew the dark beings had heard the explosion, and they were coming in mass and madly!'Please work, damn it!'Grounding his teeth, he took out the crowned statue's head and tried placing it on the headless statue with trepidation. He knew if this didn't work, then he would have to deal with hundreds of extraordinary dark beings!

Chapter 209 End Of Dark Ruins
﻿In the south of the dark ruins, there was a huge crater like a deep pit as it continued to shake, and sonic booms and glowing shock waves appeared deep within.Inside this crater, Lich King was brandishing his ghostly sword in crimson energy as he menacingly slashed at the giant, leaving afterimages.The Giant was none other than Crimson War Freedom Lord, but right now, he looked ragged rather than majestic as half of his armor was cracked, deep wounds of swords could be seen over his body, and blood was gushing out.He was on the receiving end of Lich King's fatal attacks, which seemed to have no end, and he was barely able to block them with his towering red spear.Lich King, on the other hand, was without any injury. There wasn't a scratch of his armor as dark blue flames were raging over his helmet.It's only been ten minutes since the Dark Beings had launched an all-out attack on the dark annihilation army, and Crimson War Freedom Lord arrogantly faced off with the Lich King and lured him into this place where the armies won't be affected because of their clash.However, Crimson War Freedom Lord bitterly found that he had overestimated himself, and now he was thinking about how to save his life.As for defeating the Lich King, it was a dream that he had awakened from, and he knew only if all the freedom lords worked together would they have any chance of getting rid of this appalling enemy."Here I thought the proud Giant Lord would at least pose some challenge, but you are just like those ants… I guess a thrall will be forever a thrall!" Lich King coldly scoffed as the crimson energy around this sword suddenly gushed out, forming a ten-meter-long crimson blade!Crimson War Freedom Lord's bloodshot eyes were filled with madness as he heard those belittled and disdainful words. Metallic energy suddenly gushed out from his body as he entirely turned into iron. His spear also started to released humming sounds, and he roared while he thrust it toward the crimson blade with fury, "Don't look down on giants. Die!"A huge explosion reverberated within the vicinity as the ground shook like an earthquake, raising dust clouds and debris.Within the crater, Lich King was pushed back a few meters before he stabilized himself, while the crimson energy blade was only half gone.On the other hand, Crimson War Freedom Lord was sent flying like a broken kit and smashed into the wall behind, creating a huge pit."Hmph, this dance is over!" Lich King coldly declared a ghastly aura like a raging tilde wave soared from his body, and the energy blade suddenly made an eerie sound before it increased and widened.But before Lich King could finish preparing for his last attack and finish Crimson War Freedom Lord off, the flame over his helmet suddenly fickler madly.'What?! My connection with Wight Minister is broken, which could not mean he is dead! NO! The shackle!' Without even thinking twice, the energy blade suddenly vanished, and he promptly jumped toward the sky.He suddenly roared and let loose a high-pitched voice; he was commanding the dark beings in the castle to hurry over to the underground room and do anything to get rid of the intruder while he was on his way.But he was only halfway toward the castle when the ground startled to shake, rocking the entire dark ruins.At this moment, a static voice rang all over the dark ruins, "Trial Dark Ruins has been cleared by the Life Faction. All the participants will be sent out effective immediately!""NOOOOOOO…." Lich King shrilled madly, creating a crimson shock wave as everything around him turned to dust.---Golden Swords Freedom Lord, who was in a stalemate with Lich Minister, was gobsmacked by this announcement, "What?! Life Faction completed the trial!?""How is that possible?!" Lich Minister felt his body tremble, and the protective barrier around him suddenly got affected by his emotions and was destabilized for a moment.Golden Swords Freedom Lord snapped out of his stupor as his eyes shimmered in ecstasy and the dual golden swords in his hand shimmered in golden hue before he launched a torrent of attack on Lich Minister, taking full advantage of the other party's distraction. He was simply too thrilled and wanted to get rid of this guy before they were sent out. The morals of the Dark Annihilation Army also skyrocketed as they all cheered and madly launched powerful attacks on those dark beings.---Underground room, Jacob looked at the statue of a crowned woman with twinkling eyes.The moment he put the crowned head on top of the headless statue, like a magnet, it instantly connected with the headless status.Not only that, but the next moment, a golden light suddenly enveloped the throne statue and the entire altar. When the light vanished, the kneeling statue was nowhere to be seen because she had somehow replaced the statue of the king on the throne, and now she was majestically sitting on it like a queen.Jacob didn't know what to do next as the dark beings were getting closer and closer. But at this moment, he heard a voice,"Trial Dark Ruins has been cleared by the Life Faction. All the participants will be sent out effective immediately!"The next moment, a dark hole suddenly condensed behind the throne. Jacob looked at it with relief. He knew it was the passage out of this damn place since he had appeared here the same way.He was about to take it when his eyes suddenly landed on a shining object lying a few meters away from the passage. If his vision hadn't been enhanced, he would've easily missed it.It was a black ring with red patterns on it, and now that he thinks about it, he had seen this ring on Wight Minister's finger, so without hesitation, he quickly picked it up.Without waiting any longer, he jumped into the dark hole, and after Jacob entered the dark hole, it shrunk before vanishing!

Chapter 210 Rewards Of Rare Plains Trial (1)
﻿Jacob found himself in the same black passage as he moved forward, and there was nothing around.But he didn't have time to mull over anything because his heart rate was about to break the 10X limit, and he knew his body wouldn't be able to take it.Just with the 10X acceleration, he was beet red, and he could feel his veins would explode if the blood circulation increased any future, and he will die.If not for the five pounds of meat he consumed, he would've been long dead, and his injuries were almost mended because of it.But he knew he wasn't out of the woods yet. So, he quickly sat down and at a pound more before he started to completely focus on calming his heart down.But it was far easier said than done since 10X acceleration was his current body limit, and he had yet to master even 7X acceleration fully, so it was too hard.Still, because of the excessive energy and his wound being healed, he was able to completely focus on calming his heart down as smoke was rising from his body.Time passed slowly as he calmed his heart rate little by little, and after an unknown time, he was able to exit the 10X acceleration and then 9X… 8X… 7X…When Jacob finally reached the 6X, it was starting to go even faster, and from 5X, it only took him half a minute to exit the fluid acceleration completely.At this moment, Jacob opened his eyes, and he was startled because he found himself sitting in a 10X10 white space, and he wasn't moving forward at all.'Where am I, and when did I get here?' Jacob was vigilant. He had completely lost the concept of time because he was completely focused on exiting the fluid acceleration.Furthermore, he had completely recovered, his physical condition was optimal, and his physical appearance had returned.At this moment, the static voice rang, "Faceless Ancient, congratulations, you have completed all the Trial Conditions of Rare Plains trial [Dark Ruins]!"The next moment, Jacob's star watch suddenly vibrated, and he received another message from an unknown source."You have received the Gratitude of the Maiden."'Could it be this voice belonged to Zodiac Will?' Jacob felt his heart turn cold, but he didn't let it show since it might not be a good thing.Because even Immortika was afraid of Zodiac Will, and there had to be a reason for it, so he didn't dare to be careless in front of this terrifying existence akin to gods.The static voice rang again, "Faceless Ancient belonged to the Life Faction!"The Life Being of other plains will now be freely given access to the Rare Plains as long as they aren't above the power cap until the next trial establishment."The Dark Being of other plains will have their previous access voided and returned to 10,000 being per decade!"The Protection Barrier will now be lifted from Life Plain, and Dead Plain be removed until the next trial establishment."Faceless Ancient, as the Champion of Rare Plains Trial, your Star Privilege has been increased from Type-0 to Type-1. You have Level-1 Authority over the Rare Plains until the next trial establishment!"Faceless Ancient, as the Champion of Rare Plains Trials, you have One Time right to activate the Life Zone for 500 Years by forfeiting half of your accumulated reward!"Please choose whether you want to activate the Life Zone."'Like hell, I will.' Jacob scoffed since he would be insane to give away half of his reward for those he didn't even know, especially after having a close shave with death at the end.He answered without even thinking, "I will not use this One Time Right.""Faceless Ancient, you have voided your one time right!""Your Rewards are as follows:"'For completing the condition: Destroy the Dignity of King"You are rewarded with 10,000 Zodiac Credit"'For completing the condition: Give the Maiden Hope"You are rewarded with 10,000 Zodiac Credit.''For completing the condition: Salvage the Priest with Blood Flower by staining his tears with blood"You are rewarded with 10,000 Zodiac Credit"Total Reward: 30,000 Zodiac Credit"For Clearing two conditions, the total reward has been doubled."Total Reward: 60,000 Zodiac Credit "For Clearing three conditions, the total reward has been doubled."Total Reward: 120,000 Zodiac Credit"Sole Champion Reward: 30,000 Zodiac Credit and One free Type-1 Advance Weapon from the Rare Plains Shop!"Final Reward: 150,000 Zodiac Credit and One free Type-1 Advance Weapon"The rewards have been transferred to your Type-1 Zodiac Account!"Jacob's eyes glow like the sun as he hears the collective information on his reward, which is really lavish. Just the 150,000 ZC were enough to make him the richest in the entire Rare Plains.Not to mention his Type-1 Zodiac Account had been automatically upgraded to Type-1 with this Star Privilege.He guessed this Star Privilege had to be connected with the Star Network, and anything related to star network was no joke.As for the Type-1 Zodiac Account, it simply meant he would be given a 2% discount on any purchases from the Star Network or anywhere, as a matter of fact, as long as he used ZC. His previous privilege type-0 could give him a 1% discount.Lastly, the Level-1 authority over Rare Plains, he didn't care at all since Rare Plains were just like a stop in his journey, and once he was prepared, he'll leave.He was interested in this Rare Plain Shop; Immortika also mentioned that a champion could buy anything available on a plain through this shop, and the delivery would be instant.So, he quickly asked, "What is this Rare Plain Shop?"He feigned ignorant since it would be suspicious if he knew about this shop's functions. He knew it could also be seen as he had contact with higher plains, or this voice did not belong to the actual Zodiac Will and was only an AI.Because this was just a mere rare plains trial, it would be absurd if the mighty Zodiac-Will was personally present!
