Chapter 91 Discovery
﻿"Now, you have two choices, either I can chock the lights out of you or you can tell me why you were following me around. If you chose the first option, keep struggling and if you chose the latter, then stop!"Hearing Jacob's icy voice, in the end, the long hair man chose the latter since he can't even flinch from Jacob's grip, much less escaped from it. He was utterly horrified at how strong Jacob was. Even a C-rank mercenary won't be able to manhandle him if he put his everything. But in front of Jacob, he was like a two-year-old child.Jacob finally loosened the grip, but he didn't let go."Now start signing your life story or I can simply put a full stop to it." Jacob chuckled mockingly.'He heard us?!' This gave him another jolt.They were talking in the close carriage, and he himself observed Jacob's carriage was twenty meters away from theirs all the time. It was completely impossible for Jacob to hear them from that distance with all the noise pollution.He even started to consider Jacob some rare monster who was in human disguise.He knew they had wholly miscalculated Jacob's strength and abilities. Likewise, he wasn't just some helpless, talented youth. But he was a sleeping tiger, and they unknowingly they had ruffled the tiger's whiskers.He quickly told without hiding anything, "I-it was Vice Guild Master Olaf who commission the Vice Leader Kite to keep a close eye on you! We were simply following order, we have no other motives!"Jacob wasn't surprised by Olaf's involvement. That old man always looked at him as if he was prey, but he restrained himself because of Drew and never mess with him.However, he didn't expect Olaf would seek help from the Vice Leader of the star mercenary agency, Kite.'It seemed that old guy was waiting for a chance so he could beat the secret out of me while he could also keep his hands clean even if things go south.' Jacob sneered coldly.Since he had already confirmed Olaf's scheme, which he only considered an ant's dream, he didn't need this guy anymore. Without giving any chance, he clutched his hand!'Crush!'The man's neck was crushed completely, without any resistance. He died before he even reacted!Jacob coolly threw the limp body to the side and move on. He didn't even bother with the man's belongings, since he knew he won't find anything that could interest him on this small fry.He only acted because these guys were following him like annoying flies for days now, but he didn't act since he wasn't done with his preparations.However, now, he wasn't afraid of showing his prowess and drawing attention anymore.Before, he only showed the tip of the iceberg so he could use the workshop in the gunsmith guild as much as he wished and peacefully while Drew covered for him until he was done.Now that he was done, they can come as they wish!A few hours later,Jacob finally reached the Lion Forest, which was spread over fifty miles, and there were some uncommon species residing in this place.However, what really drew him to this place wasn't the mission, but he felt a peculiar sensation within his heart when he passed this place in Peter's carriage.He simply thought it was his imagination, but after seeing the mission, he thought otherwise.Out of curiosity, he took the mission. Since he was going to pass this place, he didn't mind taking a detour.On the contrary, if he crossed the lion forest, he would get to the Rainy Mountain Range in half the time he is required to travel on the safe route.After crossing a few miles, he was carefully walked between towering trees.Suddenly, a silhouette lunged at him out of nowhere.'Fast!'Jacob's agility shifted his body and dodged the sharp fangs, and the silhouette missed the sneak attack. It directly landed on the ground and start escaping.It was a one-meter-long black snake with small brown dots on its body.'An uncommon Raptor Snake. It seemed I'm having snake soup for dinner.' Jacob smirked before he swiftly moved his hand and a dark streak shot toward the Raptor Snake which was crawling away.'Peng…'The short sword directly pierced through its head and pin it down in its place. However, right at this moment, faint smoke started to rise from the group all of a sudden.Jacob's expression changed drastically from this sudden turn of events and quickly picked up his sword.He didn't care about the snake anymore, since he could feel his senses were starting to get disenable the moment this mysterious smoke appeared.'Sedation Gas?!' Jacob quickly stopped respiring.His heart palpitated because even with his mental fortitude, he felt slightly dizzy with a faint whiff of this smoke.He knew he had entered a trap and someone who could escape his sharp hearing had to be an expert or he had accidentally triggered this trap. Nonetheless, he would not wait here to find the exact reason, as he ran at full speed!Because of his water meditation, he could hold his breath like this for over an hour, but his skin started to burn as it came in contact with this strange gas, which make it somewhat difficult for him.After running for over five hundred meters, he finally emerged from the smoke and his complexion was pale red as thick vines bulged on his forehead.He finally breathed fresh air, and his complex started to recover. He was feeling extreme rage all of a sudden. A gas nearly did him.'Who could have this kind of gas, and why did it set up in this place? Even C rank mercenary might not escape,' Jacob mused with a dark expression.He could tell this gas wasn't just effective with breathing, but it can also affect someone with skin contact as well. If not for his powerful body, he might've already been laying somewhere on that smoke screen."Hehe, it seemed I captured another one." A vague, uncanny voice rang from some distance.Jacob snapped out of his stupor and moved his body and hide behind a tree while he controlled his jittering breathing.Thereupon, a 1.2 feet tall cloaked figure walk appeared in his view.Although he can't see the face, he saw a small cylinder belted around this person's waist and a slender tube attached to it.'An oxygen mask?' Jacob's expression turned frosty with a tingle of astonishment.He now knew who the culprit behind that smoke was.However, he didn't act and observed. He now had a deep understanding of the humane kingdom's strength and what they were capable of.Although an oxygen cylinder can be bought from the apothecary guild with some connections, but it was as expensive as 50 gold coins!Furthermore, that guy's equipment was far more refined than Jacob had seen until now. They were almost at Decker's lab level!That cloaked figure unhurriedly entered the smoke screen like he was strolling in his backyard.Jacob suddenly took out a bottle filled with dark liquid. It was the last bottle he had from the dark liquid tank in Decker's lab.His recovery was extremely slow, and now this stranger appeared he needed to recover faster. So, he quickly took a mouthful and a cold sensation spread all over his body.He started to recover at a visible rate.'It was worth saving it.' Jacob was glad and stored the bottle away quickly.He never thought he would be forced to use it in the uncommon region of all the places.Now, he was even more curious yet vengeful toward the person who set up that trap."Damn it, how could a snake waste a precious the Gas-Trap?!" a confused yet angry cussing sounded at this moment and the cloaked figure appeared again."Now I have to go back empty-handed and even have to replace the trap. Damn that worm." He wasn't happy about what he found inside the smokescreen.Jacob had a stiff expression when he heard this, 'What a loose mouth. It seemed he wasn't afraid someone would hear him. Well, he made it easier for me now. But there should be more of such traps. I have to be careful. If I could just make x-ray glasses!'He felt like cussing right now.Nevertheless, soon, an icy smirk emerged on his face, before he started to follow the cloaked figure every step without missing any. He wasn't sure if there were more of those bomb traps or not, but he was sure that loose mouth won't trigger one himself.It was already getting dark.After following that cloaked figure for two hours, they reached a water source, and just as Jacob was wondering where the hideout was.That cloaked figure suddenly put his hand on a tree trunk and his icy voice rang, "Now, are you going to come out or I'll make you?!"

Chapter 92 Glean Gnome
﻿With one hand on the small tree trunk, the cloaked figure suddenly turned right in Jacob's direction, and an icy voice rang, "Now, are you going to come out or I'll make you?!"Jacob's heart churned at this moment, 'How?!'He was completely clueless about how this guy was able to find him out despite his carefulness and he even managed to lead him into a trap instead of his base location.Not only this guy kept his heartbeat steady, but he didn't lose his calm demeanor which also made Jacob believe he was in control while he was foolishly walking in a trap."If you don't come out in ten seconds I'll activate this mechanism which will trigger another smoke trap and trust me when I say the previous smoke was child play in comparison to this one, and its range is ten miles."Although I don't know how you managed to escape the previous trap, I'm sure like hell you'll not be going to escape this one…"'Bang, bang…'Before he could finish, bullet shots rang in quick succession and they were accurately aimed at his hand on the tree bark.'Heh, why talk so much? Since you need to press it I just need to make sure you don't, what a moron.' Jacob scoffed at the other party's idiocy.However, Jacob was given a fright when a transparent red barrier suddenly appeared around the cloaked figure, and the bullets reflected like rubble balls the moment they contacted it!"Hahahaha… and here I thought someone got the wind of our mission and came here to intercept us. But it's just an ignorant piggy who got lucky." A hysteric laugh sound from that person and there was a hint of relief in his voice as if the water was under the bridge now.'Is that a particle barrier?!' Jacob finally felt he was in danger when he saw the red barrier and heard that person's hysteric tone.He knew he had terribly underestimated his opponent this time, and he was extremely confident in dealing with him or he won't be spouting nonsense.However, he knew there wasn't any point in regretting it now. But he had to prevent him from triggering that trap because he could feel he didn't want to activate it that was why he wanted to draw him out with threats.Before, Jacob felt a little threatened by this smoke trap, however, now that he sees the translucent barrier. He didn't dare to take risks wantonly anymore."You win!" He said and walk out with a magnum revolver in his hand.Just as Jacob thought that cloaked figure didn't activate the trap and still wait for Jacob to come out of his own accord."Hahaha… little piggy now you understand no matter how an ant struggle or grow it can never shake the tree! Now obediently shot yourself in kneecaps, and save yourself a world of pain, or I can let you dissociate slowly your choice." He spoke with extreme confidence as if everything was under control.However, Jacob remained calm while his eyes were affixed to that barrier all this time, he blurted, "I'm curious, that barrier is probably made with Argon and Neon in the air, right? It's not manmade, but an auxiliary device triggered this phenomenon. Quite fascinating that you guys have such technology. Are you from Rare Region?""Argon and Neon? What are you talking about?" The cloaked figure seemed clueless about what Jacob just said and then he sneered coldly, "Don't play games with me, piggy. You are not qualified to even speak the name of the rare region!"'Cursed Immortality!' Jacob quickly summoned.The moment the floating book appeared, he commanded, 'What tier is his specie, tell me in detail!'He knew if he wanted to turn this situation around; he needed to know what kind of monster he was dealing with. Mutual destruction was the last option."That's a Glean Gnome, a tier-6 specie. It had reached the limit of his bloodline and it might be a genius of its race."A Glean Gnome is a top-notch intelligent species when it came to gathering information or tracking and it's difficult to sneak up on them. They had far better hearing than the Bronze Goblin you encounter previously and they can hear even the slightest chance in airflow. Hahahaha… he must've seen you coming from a mile and you walk right into his trap. How interesting!"'A tier-6, huh? Well, it seemed my luck is not bad.' Jacob didn't mind Immortika's mocking. He was silently thrilled when he read this little guy had reached his full potential.Glean Gnome seemed to have lost his cool at this moment was about to take out something from his cloak and Jacob heard it loud and clear."If your barrier can even reflect a bullet as fast as the speed of sound, then I surrender." Jacob suddenly utter before the magnum in his hand vanished and two black components one meter each in size appeared in his hand.One was a slender pitch-black barrel while the other was the exquisite body."W-what?!" Glean Gnome was startled when he saw those parts appearing out of thin air and he even forgot what was he doing.Without wasting a moment, Jacob quickly connected both parts, and a two-meter-long sniper rifle, entirely made of titan iron, emerged. He named it Titan Sniper.This rifle was his biggest trump card, but he never thought he would use this in the uncommon region.Nevertheless, he had kept it loaded so he could use it at a moment's notice, like just now.He quickly pulled the trigger after aiming at the point-blank range, while his opponent was still shocked by his infinity pendant.'Boom!'A booming sound rang in the vicinity.The red translucent barrier instantly shattered like glass, and the titan iron bullet blew the Glean Gnome's hand on the tree bark into smithereens."Ahhhh…"A ghastly howl soon followed suit.Jacob was quite satisfied with the titan sniper's prowess, but he wasn't done. He quickly closed in the slap that shrilled Glean Gnome from that tree's range."You nearly got me there. I should commend you for that." Jacob finally felt relieved."Y-you… what are you?! You can't kill me… o-or the entire uncommon region will be destroyed!" the Glean Gnome threatened while suppressing the pain.He never thought his opponent would be a way to break past his defense. Furthermore, he knew just how powerful that barrier was. Even an ordinary A-rank mercenary was helpless against it, and the weapons that can break this barrier were even more costly than that barrier.Besides, only someone with a particular status can purchase them, not just any random tom, dick, and harry.The Glean Gnome could tell Jacob was just a human, and humans could never have this kind of authority in the rare region to get their hands on these weapons.That's why he thought Jacob might've stumbled on this weapon by chance, but he was extremely confused about how it appeared out of thin air.He decided to escape with his life first and then alert his family, he will come back prepared next time and hunt Jacob down, even if he had to turn every stone in the uncommon region!How could a glorious genius of his race lose his arm to some inferior race? He was extremely arrogant and would not let this matter end until he tortured Jacob in the curliest way.But first, he had to pretend that he will not seek revenge and escape with his life.However, Jacob's next words send him the chills. "Oh, you'll be doing those worthless idiots a favor if you can really put them out of their misery. But I'm afraid you don't have this kind of authority to do so, or you guys won't be just snooping around like gutter rats. "Let me guess, there's someone extremely powerful who is protecting the uncommon region, or you guys would never let it flourish or let it grow freely. Am I right?"Jacob coolly stated as a matter of fact as he walked closer to the cloaked Glean Gnome.'Lunatic!' Glean Gnome could only think of Jacob like this, but he had to admit Jacob had almost guessed the entire truth about the uncommon region.But he can't show weakness right now, "Y-you, if you let me go. I can let you enter the rare region and give you riches you can't even dream about!" He used the biggest temptation that any uncommon specie longed for."I can go there by myself. After seeing you, I won't stay here for long. I'll be just narrowing my view and keep belittling other races like you. There are still many things to learn for me, you just make it clearer. If I stay in this environment any longer, I might die because of my own ignorance." Jacob sighed with deplored!

Chapter 93 Finding The Hideout
﻿Just as Jacob's voice trailed off."Hahahaha…" the Glean Gnome suddenly laugh hysterically as if he heard the biggest joke of his life. Despite the weakness in his voice, it sounded extremely creepy.He menacingly uttered, "Dream on little piggy, if you think you can go to the rare region with that weapon of yours, then you really have a death wish!"Jacob merely chuckled, with a hint of killing intent. "It seemed you know quite a lot, huh? How about helping me out, then? As long as you give information about the rare region as well as tell me what were you doing here, I'll give you a quick death."Glean Gnome suddenly move his hand and a small dagger appeared, and without any hesitation, he stabbed toward the small cylinder belted around his waist.He knew Jacob would never let him go; he was simply too indifferent and cold. So, he decided to end his life as well as destroy everything he was carrying in person.Although this cylinder was filled with oxygen, it was made particularly in a way that if someone poked a hole in it, it will blow like a bomb. It was also a safety measure to not fall into the enemy's hands and destroy anything important.Albeit he was unwilling to die in this place, Jacob had clearly stated he won't let him off and the information Jacob was asking was the top secret of his clan which he can't tell anyone.So, he decided to use his last resort and blow himself while gravely injuring Jacob in the process and he knew the moment he blew himself his clansman would be alerted and they might be able to avenge him by killing Jacob who would be wounded at that time.Most importantly, he didn't want to experience torture or humiliation before his death.However, it was only possible if he could outmatch Jacob's reaction speed!Jacob had long closed the distance, and he knew this guy won't go down easily. So, the moment he saw him moving, the magnum revolver appeared in his hand again, and he pulled the trigger!'Bang…'Glean Gnome's hand was only a few centimeters away from the cylinder suddenly flashed back when the bullet landed right on his wrist, and the dagger also fell!"Ahh… Bastard, I'll kill you. You can't escape once they know you killed me… haahaha!" He screamed and cursed while hysterically laughing.He lost all his reason when he looked at his half-blown wrist, and the bullet even pierced deep into his rib cage. Furthermore, he knew he can't be saved anymore.However, Jacob would not let that happen. He took out his sword, and without any word, he directly stabbed into the bullet wound."Ahhhhhh…" the Glean Gnome screamed madly when the blade entered his body.Jacob's eyes were exempt from any emotions as he finally uncloaked the Glean Gnome's face.He had a long pointy nose and a small square face with pointy teeth and brown skin. His brown eyes were completely bloodshot as he looked at Jacob with hatred and abhorrence.He never hated someone so much in his life. He never thought he was going to be killed by someone from an inferior race in the uncommon region, which was supposed to be their playground and chance for his rise.Jacob suddenly pulled an icy smile. "You look like an asshole, I know. Well now, tell me where is your facility, you don't want your last moments to be worse than death, right?" as he said those worse, he slightly twisted the hilt."Uahhhhhh… g-go to... hell… ahahahhhhhh! " His laugh turned shrill when Jacob twisted the blade even more."Come on, it'll be over quickly. Why are you making it hard for yourself?" Jacob's voice was filled with indifference as he said those words. He just couldn't feel pity or any remorse for this guy as he watched him scream.Unknowingly, he started to see everyone else as livestock and as a butcher, he won't feel anything for the livestock."F-f… fuck… ahhhhhh…"Jacob pierce even deeper but he had to admit this guy was really tough, and he knew Jacob can't anything as he will eventually die within a few minutes. He had already lost so much blood.Jacob's eyes suddenly narrowed when he observed a faint glow under the cloak. It was already dark, so this faint glow won't go unnoticed.He removed the cloak, and he saw a small device that was showing a red dot and pointed toward a specific location.Jacob instantly remembered the tracking device and the tracker he got from the tiger bull."It seemed I don't need you at all. Let me guess, you wanted to blow yourself because of the tracking marker in your body and also this device which shows you the location of your other associates."I'll get the information about the rare region out of them. Let's hope they're as tough as you, or it would be quite boring." Jacob chuckled darkly as he liked the Glean Gnome's shocked expression, filled with despair."Bast…"Before he could curse, Jacob's hand suddenly moved vertically, and the Glean Gnome's entire body was separated in half by the sharp blade!"Hmph…" Jacob merely sneered and took his 'heart box' and filled it with blood, and then took the Glean Gnome's heart.But he didn't leave the corpse laying. He buried it close to the water source and clean the scene.Since there was a rare rank race here, and this guy might be one of their geniuses, he can't leave his traces behind, which might be led to him. He has no idea what kind of strange abilities these races might possess.That's why, until he got rid of them completely, it was best to remain vigilant. As for what they were doing in the humane kingdom so far away from the rare region, he was soon going to find out.From the Glean Gnome's corpse, Jacob also got the cylinder and mask, as well as the tracking device. There wasn't any currency or identity.However, what was most interesting was the black belt around the Glean Gnome's waist. He saw the plain black buckle was now cracked and after he completely pealed the surface; he saw a charred interior with a complex structure."That barrier was probably embedded in this buckle, and it was destroyed when I used the Titan Sniper. It's a pity I won't be able to study it. Well, I might get more of these in their hideout." Jacob's lips curled.He arranged the oxygen cylinder around his wrist like the Glean Gnome, and it was still half full since he didn't know where those smoke traps were. This cylinder will be his lifesaver.Who knows just how many traps those bastards are hiding around their hideout?He looked at the pointer in the device and start to move toward it very carefully. Furthermore, the Glean Gnome tracking device was now on him. He didn't store it inside his pendant since it would connect its connection. He didn't want to alert the enemy by doing it.If anyone was monitoring these trackers, they would only think that the Glean Gnome was still alive and coming back to their hideout.Just as Jacob was a mile away from the trap, he saw a blue dot appearing in the device a few meters away.His eyes contracted. 'Can this device also tell where the traps are hidden?!'Jacob was elated, he carefully walked right where this blue dot was, and when he carefully removed the soil, something hard appeared, and he carefully clear the soil.'A landmine?!' Jacob was astonished when he saw the blue landmine.'So, that's the secret behind their so-called smoke traps is, huh? This mine should be connected with that tree somehow.' Jacob dug around it and finally noticed a string heading in the same way where he came from.'Since that guy was so confident about this trap and its range is so large, it might come in handy.' Jacob quickly got to work.Deactivating a landmine was a piece of cake for him since there weren't any anti-touch sensors.After a few minutes, he finally deactivated it and stored it in his pendant without hesitation. He wanted to disassemble it and see what was the true source of that smoke. But now wasn't the time.He again started to follow the direction and, on his way, he acquired five more landmines, but they were white, not like the previous blue one.By following the pointer, Jacob didn't know in which part he was, but he was still in the lion forest, and he had to admit those guys really knew how to hide their tracks. Without this device, even those Glean Gnomes might not find the hideout.After walking for over an hour, the end of the line finally appeared. Jacob looked at where the point was and saw it was a small muddy puddle surrounded by trees!

Chapter 94 A Surprise!
﻿Jacob looked at the tracking device in his hand and frowned slightly because he could see the trees surrounding the small muddy puddle were blinking in blue dots and they were eight for them.'Sensors or bombs or monitoring devices?' Jacob didn't approach the location since it would be too risky if he got exposed.He still didn't know just how many Glean Gnomes were there or if they had any help from the rare region. He also had no idea what kind of facility they had.Even Decker was hiding deadly traps in his small hideout, much less these guys who seemed to be here for some time, and they had all kinds of traps in this forest.'Since this device is showing the locations and trap, I wonder if it had other functions.'Jacob looked at the tracking device which was 6X4 and there wasn't any loge and it looked like a completely back smartphone. However, it only had one button to turn it off or on.Jacob had already disassembled the tracking device he got from the Hob Trolls and it had a very simple radio wave mechanism, and this didn't seem any different. Besides, it can also show traps or something in those traps.As for their energy source, there were small solar panels installed on their back that can recharge them. As for the small gemstone which was also the tracker, it was still a mystery for him because there wasn't any opening in it nor did he dare to, afraid of breaking it.He didn't have the luxury to experiment with only one device in his possession.But he was fascinated when he found out that this gemstone tracker got activated once it felt the heat of the skin, just like the parasite gem and its controller.Although he didn't know how these gems were made, he was sure they were quite high-tech and probably a very expensive commodity, even in the rare region.The devices, on the other hand, were quite easy to make as long as they had the frequency of a tracker gem. Nevertheless, Jacob didn't want to dive deep into this because being curious about these things in the uncommon region was simply wasting his brain cells and time. So, he temporarily gave up on researching these gems after having a vague idea about their operative systems.However, this also proved he still had many things to learn, and just because he had some knowledge and breakthrough in his previous life, this doesn't mean he was the number one genius in this world.Arrogance and ignorance will only get him so far, and he learned his lesson on the day when he accepted Cursed Immortality.But today he also learned if he stayed in shallow waters for much longer, he got used to it and when he entered the sea, it will swallow him!He had to learn to survive in the sea and only then he'll learn the way of the sea!But it also doesn't mean he'll be going to announce his arrival to those monsters hidden deep within.Jacob looked at the tracking device and then at those trees. Although he didn't know for sure what traps were there, he wasn't in a hurry to find out.It was already deep at night, and he was already at his destination. Once that Glean Gnome didn't return to the base within a specific time, they might come out to look for him.From his arrogant tone, he sounded extremely confident, and Jacob counted on it.He'll slowly chip away their numbers before they made some mistakes.After deciding to this point, Jacob close the tracking device and put it in his pocket, since he didn't want to cut off the connection completely.On the contrary, he was going to use it to his own advantage.'Since they can track this device, I can control their movements and lead them into traps. I can't use the titan sniper unless it was necessary.'Albeit the titan sniper was powerful, its voice was loud despite Jacob's effort to suppress it as much as he could, but he needed some unique tools that the workshop in the gunsmith guild in the lionheart city didn't have to completely suppress that thunderous voice.Lastly, the bullets were quite precious, and it still didn't have a matching scope that can bring out the gun's true potential.Jacob left the area to start working on his plan to capture those Glean Gnomes alive, or anyone who lived in that lab.He dug a deep pit and then hide it before throwing the tracker he found in the Glean Gnome's body. While he hid in the crown of a tree not far away from his trap.Time passed, and the entire night ended as the dawn started to break. Jacob still didn't detect any movement.But he kept waiting patiently.However, when the entire day pass without any movement, he wondered if this device had led him to some hoax hideout and if he was just wasting his time.But he still didn't move and decided to wait for another two days, and if he still didn't detect any movement, he'll leave and return to the lionheart city before he began his travels toward the rare region.Although, this hideout of Glean Gnomes might give him some information about the rare region. He wasn't enough desperate to waste his time while he can extract another tier-6 heart essence.Besides, he won't get any more heart essence even if he hunted more Glean Gnomes. It simply wasn't worth so much time.Now, it depends on their luck if they didn't appear!Today was the third night since Jacob was lying in wait when he suddenly felt a mild tremor on the ground.Jacob was instantly alerted because it was just too sudden, and followed by this tremor, a ghastly roar reverberated in the area,"Roarrrrr…"Jacob's expression changed because this roar rang from the same direction as the hideout location.'This voice is even more intimidating than that bull. Just what were they doing here, exactly?' Jacob was curious, and he was about to go to take a look when…"I think they're here. Let's go before someone else come here. We can't miss this chance!"Jacob heard a familiar voice a couple of meters from his hiding position on the west side and he could also hear the rustling sound of many footsteps rushing toward the hideout direction.'It seemed I won't have to test the waters myself.' Jacob's lips suddenly curled into a wintry smile when he thought about who it was and crept behind that group.Soon, they reached the location of the small muddy puddle.However, Jacob was astonished when he saw the puddle wasn't there anymore and a ten-meter-wide hole has appeared in its place.Furthermore, when Jacob's eyes shifted toward an over six-meter-tall silhouette, his expression turned stern."Captain, it seemed you were right about the Goblin Facility being in the lion forest and if we managed to capture it, we'll be famous not to talk about rich!" A man's elated voice rang. Jacob finally glanced at the group. They were ten people wearing many gears and mercenary armor, with a variety of firearms and cold weapons."Don't jump to conclusion, that thing that crawled out from that hole is probably a B-rank and it might've killed all the goblins in the facility when it managed to escape."We don't need to kill this thing, just drive it away toward the closest town, while we'll collect the research records in that facility. That's what holds the true value!"Jacob was very familiar with this voice. It was none other than Rosalia who he rejected the invitation from before leaving the Rain Town.He didn't think she was inviting him to raid the Glean Gnomes Hideout, and it seemed she was under the false impression that this facility was established by the green goblins or she simply didn't want to reveal the truth despite knowing how dangerous this raid mission could be.'That's why she was recruiting mercenaries in the towns, so they could be her cannon folds. But I probably clean the traps for them, that's why they appeared here with no scratch.'Now she wanted those cannon folds to lure that thing away from the facility toward a town, so even if those cannon folds died, those people will take their places while she plunders the hideout. How ruthless.'Jacob couldn't help but slightly admired Rosalia's scheming and decision-making abilities.Suddenly, everyone heard a husky voice filled with indifference ring in the vicinity. "At least I don't have to worry about the food for my pet. Go feed to your heart content!"Just as this voice trailed off, two red, glowing eyes snapped opened and turned toward Rosalia's group.Even Jacob, who was still fifty meters away, felt his heart palpitated when he felt murderous air filling the surroundings when those red beastly eyes opened!'Powerful!' This was the only word that came to his mind!

Chapter 95 A Mutant
﻿"Someone can control this thing. We need to get rid of this anomaly. Prepare your weapons, we're using plane C!" Rosalia commanded with a hint of shock.She didn't know someone can control that beast, which extinguished her hope of distracting it. Now she had to find the person who was controlling that beast and get rid of him before things get out of hand."Roarrrrr…"This deafening roar made them look toward the beast again. Because of the night, they didn't see the true appearance of the beast and thought it was just some captured beast.However, as that so-called beast come closer to the range of their torches, they finally had a clear look and their heart trembled when they saw the 'beast'.It was a humanoid brown monster with slimy liquid gushing out from its body, its mouth was filled with sharp fangs and its red eyes were filled with killing intent."What the fuck is this thing?!" a burly man yelled in horror.Rosalia also found this unbelievable when she saw the appearance of that thing. This was their first time seeing such an abomination, and it looked nothing like some beast.Some of the mercenaries opened fire in fear, but to their horror, those bullets simply bounce off that thing!"Captain, this is not how we plan. Even the rifle bullets have no effect on it!" A woman shouted with an aghast expression.'She lied to me. This is not a goblin facility we can raid!' Rosalia's heart palpitated with fear and hatred in her eyes. She never thought she would get tricked into coming here, or it was also a possibility that her partner didn't know about this either.Nevertheless, it wasn't time to mull over it, because the monster's speed suddenly increased as it ran toward the burly man with its mouth wide open.She shouted, "Retreat, this mission is over, safe yourself!" She directly dashed toward the woods.Everyone looked at fleeing Rosalia with a hint of bewilderment and resentment. But they knew every mercenary was like this and once they sense real danger, they would also save their own skin first.So, Rosalia fleeing action wasn't out of their expectation. There wasn't any fighting chance against that monster, since they can't even faze it with bullets.They all fled in different directions, while the burly man had the aggro of that monster!"Bunch of backstabbers!" His voice was filled with hatred as if he had done nothing like this before or he won't do the same if he was in their shoes.Furthermore, the brown monster's speed was increasing at an alarming rate and despite being a C rank mercenary, he was losing ground quickly."Heh, running won't help…" The same husky voice rang in the vicinity, filled with disdain.Jacob also saw the monster and couldn't summon cursed immortality instantly."What is that thing?" He quickly asked while his eyes were affixed on the monster, as it seemed to grow stronger with every second.Furthermore, the hole was now unguarded since that monster was busy chasing those mercenaries.Immortika wrote teasingly, "It seemed your luck is not bad."Jacob frowned. "What do you mean? I don't have time to play riddle with you!""Hehehehe, that thing is actually a manmade mutant after they combine genes of two species so they could achieve evolution. However, do you think those bunch of pig brains can achieve something like this and break the limit on their bloodline so easily?"They're simply playing god and they're terrible at that as well. Nevertheless, since that mutant is a mixture of two species, it meant it's a new species entirely."Currently, its rank is Tier-7 and if he ate enough living beings, he can evolve into tier-8, but that's its limit since it was born after mixing the tier two genes into tier five genes."Hehehe… that's why I said it was your chance. If you can let it evolve into tier-8 and then kill it and acquire its heart, you'll probably 10% increase in the cursed mark."Most importantly, you failed to awake any ability on your 10% completion last time, but with that mutant heart, your chance of awakening an ability will also be higher since your heart is also mutant."Jacob's eyes suddenly lit up when he read the last details. He had already heard about the ability from Immortika, but he never managed to awaken it.Now, he was hearing it again, and it seemed his chances were quite high.He suddenly looked at the monster, who had already gobbled up that burly mercenary whole despite his struggle, and quickly dashed toward the other direction where another mercenary had escaped."That monster has already entered the rank of rarer specie, if I let it grow to tier-8, I'm afraid I would lose the ability to hunt it down altogether. What if I killed it now?" Jacob asked."That mutant is still an infant. If you kill it now, you'll only get the normal benefits of swallowing a tier-7 species. A mutant like this only benefits you if it matured completely."Hehe, why don't you let it eat all those humans who are at the peak of tier-3 and then fed it that fellow hiding in that hole, it's a tier-5 Hob Troll who had broken the limit of its bloodline two times," Immortika suggested.Jacob's interest was suddenly piqued. "Hob Troll? What do you mean, broke the limit two times?"He knew hob trolls were a tier three species like humans and this hob troll was a tier-5. Immortika also mentions how that mutant came into being. It was also because someone tried to break the limit."Didn't I already explain that there are some species that can evolve in tiers despite the lower tiers they were born with? This is called the limit break and the more limit a species breaks, the stronger it is from the other natural specie of the same rank."Simply put, a B rank human is someone who had broken the limit of their bloodline, and A rank is the same case. The species with intelligence can break their limits and evolve into higher-tier species as long as they knew which is the right path for them."This is a higher concept you'll come in contact with once you meet the species above tier-12. You'll know just how insignificant you truly are. Hahahahaha…"Jacob felt slight fear, but there was a hint of expectation in his eyes when he thought just how deep this entire concept was and he wasn't even qualified to be a frog in the well yet.However, just as Immortika said, this wasn't the time to know about these things and he should be grateful that the usually annoying book revealed this much to him without wasting his time in talking circles.'Well, let's see how strong a hob troll who had broken this so call bloodline limit is.' Jacob's lips curled into a wintry smile. He had already killed hob trolls without using his strength before.Furthermore, this hob troll seemed to be in control of that mutant. If he could gain that control, he can easily kill that mutant after letting it evolve into tier-8."Is there more species in that hole?" He asked."Only one, it seemed that hob troll had already fed everyone inside to that mutant to help it acquire this much strength. Hehehe… I wonder who will win between you two."Jacob's eyes narrowed, "Do you mean that hob troll is as strong as me?"He knew just how strong he was, and there was hardly anyone who could give him a fight in the uncommon region."Hehehe… I can't answer this question!""I have already gotten my answer with your creepy laugh." Jacob sneered and close the book.'If things come to shove, I'll just use the titan sniper,' Jacob sneered.Before he take any further action, he take out something from his pendant, it was a faceless dark mask made with titan iron. He had saved it for such occasions. He put on the mask, and it fit his face perfectly.Then he suddenly unfolded his collar and it turned into a long hood, he covered his head with the hood on his jacket completely hiding his silver hair. Now only his amber eyes were visible.He slowly crept toward the dark hole.If that mutant didn't have any allure to him, he would never take such a risk, and if he wanted to hunt that thing after it mature, he had to get rid of this hidden threat first.Jacob looked down the hole, and it was twenty meters deep and there was a dim light."It seemed you managed to escape my pet's detection. Interesting." Jacob suddenly turned around and finally notice the voice source. It was coming from a tree. He understood, those blue dots he saw in that device were monitoring devices, and that guy was still in the hideout, monitoring everyone like he was watching a show.Jacob suddenly pull a stiff smile under his mask as he sneered, "How about you come out of this small hole of yours and we have a chat.""It's meaningless, you're dead whether you meet me or not." The voice was filled with indifference and disdain as if Jacob wasn't worth his attention.Jacob suddenly put a hand in his inner pocket and pull out a blue landmine. He waved the landmine on the tree and coolly said, "I wonder if I threw this in this hole, will you crawl out or not!"

Chapter 96 Bluffing
﻿Jacob suddenly put a hand in his inner pocket and pull out a blue landmine, he waved the landmine on the tree and coolly said, "I wonder if throw this in this hole, will you crawl out or not!""It seemed you have some skills to even acquired that intermediate smoke-mine without blowing yourself up. But are you sure you wanted to meet me?" The voice still sounded indifferent.Jacob, however, didn't buy that calm act and sneered, "If you wanted to buy time for your pet to come here, I promise I'll throw it inside before I leave. What do you think will happen then?"Truth be told, Jacob didn't want to waste this smoke mine, since it was probably the Glean Gnomes' trump card to get rid of a powerful opponent like him.That's why he was threatening, and he also wanted to see just how much this mine can scare this hob troll who was as strong as him."Since you wish for death, I'll grant your wish." The husky voice was icy cold, but there was a hint of anger in his voice this time.Jacob's lip curled. He didn't want to go inside the hideout where this hob troll had an absolute advantage, since he knew where the traps were set and how to activate them.Fighting outside was the best option, and he now had some idea just how scary this mine was, so he quickly put it away and took out two white smoke mines, and without any hesitation, he threw them inside with a wintry smile.'If you think I'll let you walk out without any consequences, then you are a moron,' Jacob sneered before he quickly dashed toward the tree.He never said he will fight fairly, besides if that mutant came back he might not handle two of them together, and then he had to kill the mutant as well that be a great waste.Furthermore, the ladder seemed to be destroyed by the mutant when it crawled upward. He wanted to see how that hob troll will climb up with that annoying smoke.Jacob quickly pulled out his titan sniper, and after connecting it, he aimed it toward the hole. The moment that hob troll appeared, he will not hesitate to shoot him.However, smoke suddenly started rising, covering the entire hole.Jacob frowned, but he didn't move from his position while staring at the smoke. He was also alert for any movement of that mutant.When a minute passed, Jacob suddenly noticed someone flying out the hole, and when he had a closer look, his expression changed, 'A Stick Grenade?!'Without any delay, he quickly took cover. He never thought this opponent was this resourceful, and this also take away his chance of killing that guy in one shot.With a booming sound, the smoke and dust cover the area.Jacob quickly attached the sniper to his back before he drew one short sword in one hand while a black shotgun appeared in another hand. It was the shotgun he had made himself, and it was far more powerful than those low-quality shotguns he acquired.Jacob suddenly heard quick footsteps coming his way.'He knew I'm here!' Without any hesitation, he shot in that direction!'Boom…'"You're not just talking, huh? But if you think these bullets can touch me, and this is where your confidence came from, then you're already dead!" The hob troll sneered.Jacob heard something flying right toward him.'This bastard.' He knew this was another stick grenade and quickly dashed toward another tree."Boom…"The tree was blown into debris."Since you wanted to play. Let's play!" Jacob's voice was icy cold, and without any hesitation, he dashed toward the hob troll while putting the shotgun away, and he drew his second short sword."You're not afraid of death, aren't you?" The hob troll clearly heard Jacob coming, and he seemed to want just that.Jacob saw a tall figure wrapped in a dark cloak at this moment. But his focus turned on the long two-meter-long black spear in this figure's hand, especially the dark spear blade. It was five feet long and extremely sharp.'Titan Iron?' Jacob instantly identified the blade, since he had worked with the titan iron, and his blade was the same.However, that spear was made with extremely high craftsmanship while his swords were made by Isaac, who was only a blacksmith in a small town.The cloaked hob troll also seemed to spot the two-short sword in Jacob's hands."Who are you?" His voice was stern with a hint of shock. He knew the titan iron wasn't something just anyone could gain."Your death," Jacob smirked before he slashed his left sword toward the hob troll's hand."Hmph, big words." The hob troll's voice was mixed with rage. He swung his long spear vertically without giving Jacob's short sword any chance of approaching him.However, when both blades clashed, sparks appeared, and when the hob troll thought Jacob would be sent flying, but on the contrary, he felt a tremendous force behind that strike.'A-A… A rank?! How is that possible?! He's not human!' The hob troll was shocked this time because he was a hidden A rank expert and didn't achieve it by himself as well.That's why he knew better than another just how powerful an A-rank expert was and how difficult to enter this rank was for races in the uncommon region.Before, he thought this masked man was from humans, but he knew humans didn't have any A rank expert, nor had they had such support to help them reach this rank.That's why he quickly assumed Jacob from the rare region and he was probably hired by the Glean Gnomes to protect their people in secret. His absolute confidence in winning this fight also crumbled when this realization struck him.Jacob was also slightly shocked when he felt his opponent wasn't weaker than him at all.It was his first time clashing with someone who could take his full force attack and remain standing.They both move back a few feet after their first clash.The hob troll coldly asked, "Who are you, and why are you getting in my way? Do you know the consequence of hindering the business of Killer Skull Society?"Before the hob troll wanted to kill Jacob, but now that he has a taste of Jacob's strength, he knew winning against Jacob would exhaust his most trump cards, which he didn't want.Furthermore, the mutant was still hunting those mercenaries, and Jacob didn't give him any chance to summon it back when he threw those smoke mines inside.That's why he stated the name of the organization behind him because in his mind Jacob was from the rare region and in the rare region very few powers provoke the Killer Skull Society because everyone knows the members of Killer Skull Society were all suicidal lunatics.Not even an A-rank mercenary would clash with Killer Skull Society alone or he had to look over his shoulder all the time.A sudden realization dawned on Jacob, he couldn't help but sneer, "So, you are one of the clowns of that clown society. I was just wondering where I had seen this kind of dressing before." "You dare to spout nonsense about my society? Do you dare to reveal your background?!" The hob troll was furious when he heard Jacob's belittling tone.But he was secretly more vigilant about Jacob's background now.Jacob sneered, "I'm the Protector of the Zodiac Taurus Bank in the uncommon region, and I don't want your clown society hindering our business, so give me the control of that thing and scram."Jacob also didn't want to get in the fight with this hob troll now. First, he wasn't confident in stopping him, and second, he still didn't know all of his hidden trump cards.So, it wasn't worth fighting him as long as he can trick him into submission and make him give up the mutant.That was why he simply bluffed about being the Protector of the Zodiac Taurus Bank. Although he had no proof, his strength was enough proof and his opponent would also think this way."Protector of Zodiac Taurus Bank?" The hob troll was shocked.The bigwigs of the three hegemonies weren't something even the Killer Skull Society provoked.However, the hob troll was completely unwilling because they had exhausted vast resources to make that mutant and even tricked a race of the rare region.That mutant was a crucial part of their plan.How could he hand it over so easily?"If your excellency is willing to back down, I'll compensate you with 10 Million Gold Coins and won't cause much trouble in the humane kingdom." The hob troll tone wasn't arrogant anymore, as he didn't want to fight Jacob to death.Jacob couldn't help but smile coldly and shook his head, "I want that thing. You can do whatever you want as long as you stay away from my business. Or I can issue an order to every mercenary branch in the uncommon region to hunt every single member of your clown society!"

Chapter 97 The Might Of Titan Sniper
﻿The hob troll's voice turned extremely icy. "Are you really want to do this over a failed product?"He really couldn't understand why Jacob was after that mutant since it had no value except it was a killing machine that didn't feel pain or remorse while killing.If Jacob weren't an A rank, he might risk killing Jacob and completing the mission before vanishing from the uncommon region.Even if the Zodiac Taurus Bank sent someone to seek revenge, he and the members of the Killer Skull Society would be long gone in hiding.The Killer Skull Society was extremely secretive, and no one knows how it operates or where its hideouts were. That's why no one could get rid of it, despite being hated by almost everyone.However, Jacob's appearance had caught him off guard, since they didn't know someone like him even exist in the uncommon region despite their information network.If Jacob really can move the mercenary of the entire uncommon region, even the ones in the Earthen Kingdom, which was their base of operation, it would hinder whatever they were doing in the uncommon region.Which was far more important than a mutant.Now, he had only two choices, do as Jacob said and report this to the higher-ups, or he can risk everything which would put his life in danger and if Jacob had some trump cards, he might even die or lose a limb or two.Jacob sneered, "Why don't you try?" He could sense the opponent was almost in his hand."Roarrr…"Suddenly, the mutant's roar rang from a few hundred meters in the distance.'That thing is coming back!' Jacob's expression turned somewhat dark.The Hob Troll suddenly dashed toward Jacob while he thrust his spear toward his chest."As long as I can keep you here, who will know what happened?" The Hob Troll's voice was filled with killing intent.He finally made his choice; this mutant was just too important for their real purpose in the uncommon region. Now that it was coming back, if he could use its strength, Jacob would be dead and before anyone knows what happened to Jacob, he would be long gone!Jacob knew things were going south, and he only had a minute or two before that mutant will reach here. He had to kill this guy and get hold of the control of that mutant.He used the sword in his left hand like a shield and slashed the other on the hob troll's wrist.The hob troll's reaction wasn't slow, either. He slid his hand down and Jacob's sword met with the spear shaft, creating sparks.Jacob, on the other hand, was forced back because of the spear's impact on his chest.'He's delaying!' Jacob quickly saw through that hob troll's scheme.With that spear length, he could easily keep Jacob away from himself as long as he didn't make any mistakes.Their reflexes were equally matched, which also made it impossible for them to kill each other quickly. While the hob troll also had a psychological advantage in the form of the mutant.He knew Jacob would be desperate because of the mutant, and he just had to wait before he found an opening in Jacob's defense. As long as he wound Jacob gravely, he would use his trump card to make sure Jacob won't leave this place alive.However, he underestimated Jacob when he thought Jacob would use just swords to play his game.Jacob unexpectedly threw his sword at him like an arrow, before he detached the sniper from his back and take aim.The hob troll didn't expect Jacob would abandon his weapon for that long gun attached to his back. He wasn't afraid of bullets because in his view guns were not effective against A rank expert and even if those bullets touched them, they would only leave small wounds.The skin of A-rank mercenary was as tough as rock, so there were very few guns that could actually hurt them, and they were almost impossible to acquire since those stingy Gunsmiths won't sell them easily.So, he only focused on blocking the incoming sword.Even if that bullet hit him, it would only leave a scratch since he was also wearing armor and that cloak was also made with a beast hide and he also had an extra hidden layer of protection.Jacob's lips curled upward, and he pulled the trigger."Boommmmm…"The titan bullet, despite being shot after the sword, reached its target first.The hob troll's heart palpitated when he heard that deafening gunshot. He was caught off guard, and he didn't even see the shadow of that bullet as it directly landed just below his neck.That impact was far more powerful than the impact he received from Jacob's strike and he was sent flying like a rag doll.Furthermore, the bullet was so fast that the shield barrier activated after the bullet successfully pierced through his cloak and armor and struck between his lungs.However, because of those two 'shield' protections, he was still alive, or that bullet could've completely poked a huge hole in his chest. But this didn't mean he was fine; his windpipe was also pressed by that bullet now, and his breath become ragged while the piercing pain assaulted him.He finally understood Jacob's throwing his sword was just a decoy, and his real trump card was this bullet, and he was now completely horrified of that gun despite the surrounding barrier.This wound was not something he could ignore and continue to fight.Just as he was still in shock, 'Click…' the sound of reloading rang in his ears.Despite the surrounding barrier, he didn't feel safe anymore and wasn't confident like before.'I have to escape and report this to higher up!' He quickly abandoned any thought of struggle, and with extreme difficulty, he suddenly slapped his leg. Jacob was about to shoot another bullet when dark blue smoke suddenly rose from the ground at an alarming rate."Hmph, paltry tricks!" Jacob completely ignored that smoke, since it still wasn't fast enough to cover that wounded hob troll. He pulled the trigger!The hob troll was frightening now. He even pulled the spear between his head and neck. He knew as long as he can avoid damage to these parts, he can escape, and Jacob would probably aim at this area.His gamble paid off, Jacob wanted to end it and took a headshot.Although the bullet breaks the barrier, the titan iron spearhead only bends but does not pierce or broke by the bullet impact.But it was enough to make a deep wound on the hob troll's head!'Fuck…' Jacob cursed when he saw that blade safe that hob troll. He again reloaded, but this time the smoke already reached his face, and the hob troll had vanished.But he still took the shot. He was too close to killing that hob troll."Boomm…"The bullet literally created a hole in the smoke with its speed, and when Jacob saw the bullet land on the ground, there wasn't any tract of that hob troll except his blood.He knew that bastard had escaped!"Shit!" Jacob was exasperated.This smoke was just too thick. and when noticed the burning sensation on his skin, his expression darkened even more.'Is this the blue landmine?!' He was alarmed when he thought about it. and his skin suddenly started charred!He quickly pulled the hood over his eyes and dashed toward the hole not far away. Likewise, he knew this smoke was too deadly even for him, and that the underground hideout was his chance to escape it.Furthermore, he didn't want to try and outrun this smoke since he had no idea just how much range it had. and that hob troll might be in that hideout as well.That guy was gravely wounded by him and it won't be easily run in this blue acidic smoke.He wanted to finish that guy off since this might also kill the approaching mutant as well. It took away his chance to acquire a tier-8 mutant heart, and the benefits came with it.When he jumped inside the hole, the white smoke was still there but because of Tiger Bull's hide, it didn't affect Jacob much. and he also covered his hands and face. So, he was fine for now.Jacob tried to look around, he saw a pathway that led to the other side, which was lit in dim light.He slowly walked with silent feet, while his sniper was aimed in front and the sword in his other hand.At the end of the hallway, Jacob saw something very familiar, there was a glass cell like in the Decker's lab but it was completely broken.'Did they make that mutant here?' Jacob guessed as he noticed the blue liquid on the floor, mixed with blood and gore, with some body parts of humans.It was a horrendous sight.There was some scattered medical equipment and a broken stretcher.But Jacob's attention was drawn to the opening of the west corner of this place, which was glowing in faint light!

Chapter 98 Hunting The Mutant
﻿Jacob slowly moved toward that opening, when he was in front of that opening, he saw a huge monitor which was showing the entire lion forest with a glowing red dot.There was a map on the wall.'A monitoring room, is that the mutant?' Jacob's eyes narrowed when he looked at the red dot, which was now moving away from this area at an incredible speed.After making sure that hob troll wasn't hiding anywhere, he relaxed a bit and started to search through the monitor room. He also pocketed that unfamiliar map. Jacob just looked behind the wide monitor screen when his expression changed because there was a timer that continued counting down, and there were only fifteen seconds left until it reached zero!"That hateful prick!" Jacob couldn't help but cursed out loud, and without waiting to see what that timer was about, he took a last glance at the monitor and ran toward the exit at full speed.The dark blue smoke was already starting to enter the hideout, but Jacob didn't care about that. He quickly jumped around the wall like a monkey and exited the hideout into the thick blue smoke.He quickly hid his skin and ran in the east direction without stopping.Thereupon, a booming sound rang in the vicinity, and a tremor passed through the ground.Jacob's eyes were deadly cold. 'Don't let me catch you!'He knew that hob troll was behind the activation of that timer so he could destroy everything in that hideout if things goes awry, and he succeeded.Jacob knew there was something that hob troll didn't want anyone to see, and the mutant control might be in that place as well. Now everything was gone, while that mutant might die in this smoke.He also lost one of his short swords he threw at the hob troll and wasted titan bullets.However, Jacob suddenly noticed the resistance of that thick smoke was getting lighter. He couldn't help but peek slightly, and the blue smoke was getting lighter and lighter with every second.But what was different about this was, he wasn't getting out of the range of the smoke but it was now moving in a west direction at an extremely alarming rate like some vacuum was sucking it.'Now what?' Jacob was astonished because that direction was the exact direction where the mutant fled in.Jacob frowned slightly. It was his chance to get out of here, but he was curious about why this smoke was going in that direction.'Here goes nothing. If this was that hob troll, I'll get rid of that prick for good, and acquire that mutant heart while at it,' He thought and followed that smoke from a safe distance while his titan sniper was in his hand.After following the smoke for over eight hundred meters, Jacob finally saw the source, and he was shocked.He saw a gigantic shadow in the center of the blue smoke, and all the smoke was vanishing into this shadow. But the most shocking thing was that the shadow was growing larger as the blue smoke got absorbed by it.'That mutant is absorbing this smoke?!' Jacob had seen the mutant, and that shadow looked exactly like it, and it was already six meters tall now.'Fuck, I can't summon Immortika anymore. Is it evolving somehow with this smoke's help?' Jacob could only guess now since he had no idea how this evolution worked.But he could feel that the mutant was growing stronger at an alarming rate.'This might be my chance!' Jacob's heart raced when he thought about how this disaster turned into an opportunity for him.He quickly hid within the crown of a tree that was now filled with withered leaves and waited for that mutant to absorb the smoke completely.On the south of the lion forest, a figure surrounded by a red transparent barrier was running while drops of blood kept falling from his cloak.He halted when he felt the blue smoke was gone.Without delay, he skewered his fingers into the bloody hole in his chest and groaned as he gritted his teeth. Soon he slid his fingers out, and a 16 mm black bullet head could be seen between his fingers.He growled in hatred while clenching the bullet head. "I'll remember this!"He then takes out a small metal flask and gulped a green liquid down completely.'How did I exit the area of the intermediate smoke mine so quickly?'The hob troll was confused, but when he thought about Jacob and the gun that could even break past the shield barrier, he didn't want to stay here to find out the reason behind it.He then glanced around before he began to move again, his speed was much faster than before.'I never thought the mission would fail in the humane kingdom without it even begun. I have to report it to the higher-ups. It seemed someone is paying attention to the uncommon region, and the letter disappearance might also have something to do with it.'It's good that I have already connected the self-destruction trigger with this intermediate mine. Now no one will get anything out of that place.'We had to lie low for the time being. As for that Protector, I look forward to our next meeting.' His dark green eyes were filled with killing intent as he vanished into the dark forest.On the other side,Jacob had no idea the hob troll was completely clueless about what was happening with the mutant right now.The smoke was already gone, and the seven-meter-tall mutant appeared tens of meters away from him.Its color was now purple while its humanoid body was more muscular and its long ugly face had characteristics of a Glean Gnome, except for its emotionless glowing red eyes, and the dreadful aura it was giving off."Howlllllll…."It suddenly let loose a reverberating howl, which made even Jacob feel pressure.'It has evolved!' Jacob was sure of it as his face lit up.With a cold smile, he aimed directly toward its head and pulled the trigger!He didn't want to fight this thing and save some bullets, it simply wasn't worth it.'Boom…'The titan bullet directly landed on its huge slimy head, and the impact made the huge mutant lose its balance, and it fell between trees.However, it wasn't dead. The bullet only penetrated its thick skin. With a deafening mad cry, it quickly ran on his limb between trees.Jacob's expression turned serious when he saw this. 'It seemed it wasn't just a mindless idiot anymore. It can tell the titan bullet can threaten its life so he's running. But you're not getting away that easily.'Jacob's lips curled before he chased the fleeing mutant while he changed the empty magazine with his spare one while storing the empty one away.He aimed while running and pulled the trigger.Another sonic boom rang, and the bullet landed on the mutant's shoulder, which made it cry in pain and rage.It twisted around and threw a punch toward the direction where that bullet had come from. But Jacob kept a fifty-meter distance from it, and the mutant did not know how far he was, so the punch only blasted a tree.Although it was intelligent to tell the danger and fled for its life, it wasn't that intelligent to know how a gun works.Jacob sneered and again pulled the trigger while aiming right where the bleeding hole in its head was, now it was in his view.'Boom…''Bullseye!' Jacob smirked when the bullet landed on its mark.The mutant let loose a ghastly howl, this time as it clutched his head with its claws. The bullet had pierced through the skull and his brain, and if it was someone else, they would've been dead by now.Jacob knew it was only a matter of time before that mutant will die. So, he didn't waste more bullets and kept watching as the mutant shrill screams become powerless.After ten minutes of struggle, the mutant hands finally turned lump, and it started to fall on its head forward.'Boom…'Another bullet pierced the same head wound again, which also send the mutant flying back!It was an insurance shot by Jacob just to make sure that thing died completely.After the mutant fell to the ground with a massive thud, Jacob still waited for ten minutes before he finally came out of his cover.He crept toward the huge body of the mutant, which lay lump between the destroyed trees.He had to admit that this mutant was really like a cockroach.Jacob kicked the mutant a few times and after he was completely sure that it was dead, he attached his sniper on his back again and took out his sword.He walked toward its chest and cut open its slimy chest.When he saw the two feet, large blue heart, he was astonished.Nevertheless, he took out the heart box, and the heart barely fit in it. He then had to use another box to fill it with blood. As for its meat, he would not eat it after watching it absorb that blue smoke.Without caring about what will happen next, he left toward the Lionheart City. It's time for him to leave the uncommon region!

Chapter 99 Leaving
﻿Ten hours after Jacob left the Lion Forest,A small regiment of soldiers appeared in the area where an enormous crater was located, and some soldiers were completely blocking the vicinity, closing it for civilians.A tall middle-aged man in leather clothes with a sword scabbard on his back was standing in front of the mutant body with another middle-aged man in a lavish outfit with long hair.Two beauties were standing beside this long-haired man. One of them wore a tight hunter outfit while the other was wearing white loose robes and a veil to cover her face, but her intelligent eyes were looking at the mutant with great interest.The long hair middle-aged man suddenly spoke with indignation, "You discovered this facility and didn't even bother to tell me about you? Are you rebelling, Rose!"The tall heroic beauty was none other than Rosalia, or Rose, who managed to escape with her life last night because the mutant mysteriously decided to return. She didn't dare to stay here and directly found her father, the overseer of the City Lord, Ville Lionheart, and told him everything.Ville was naturally shocked when he heard about that monster that couldn't be hurt with bullets and can eat C-rank mercenaries like carrots.Although he was furious at Rose for keeping it a secret from him, he had no time to scold her because he knew his arrogant and proud daughter won't seek him unless she can't handle anything herself. And if she can't handle something, this means it was really serious.So, he quickly contacted the Vice Leader Kite of the Star Mercenary Agency to come with him and investigate.Kite quickly agreed when he heard there was a facility in this place, which means huge profit if they get anything valuable.However, when they reached this place, not only the facility was destroyed by someone, but the monster was also slain!Truth be told, when Kite saw the mutant, even he felt his heart jump and thanked the person who killed it, or this thing might really flatter the entire fief of the lionheart family, his agency included.Rose pursed her lips, and she said, "I told you I was wrong. We have a more important matter to deal with. Can we talk about it after we found out who killed it and destroyed the facility?"Rose had first-handedly experienced the might of this mutant and she never felt so much despair in her life as she felt last night.Ville's expression turned livid. "You dare to talk back?! You are grounded for a year!"He was really furious not because the facility was destroyed or Rose hide the truth, but because Rose nearly get herself killed because of some fame and wealth.He loved his daughter far more than anything, and Rose was the apple of his eyes as the eldest daughter and most talented of his children. But he had spoiled her so much, she now didn't even listen to him.That's why I was now regretting his way of raising her.Rose merely pouted but didn't retort anymore. She knew her dad meant well and care about her and it was her fault, to begin with, so she remained silent this time.Ville finally looked at the veiled woman, who had a gorgeous figure even more seductive than Rose. He sighed and asked bitterly, "Guild Master, please forgive my manner. Did you discover what this thing is?"This vale woman was none other than the Guild Master of Apothecary Guild, Paula.Normally, Paula never bothered herself with anyone, as she was obsessed with her research. But today she approached Ville and requested to tag alone when she found out about the incident last night from her sources.Ville was more than happy to have her on board since she was an expert when it came to biological things like this.Paula said with uncertainty, "First, it would be better if we don't touch it with our hands. Do you see the conditions of the trees and group beneath this monster? It is probably some poisonous substance."Second, whoever killed it. They killed it with an extremely powerful projectile weapon, like a gun, and then take its heart and left."Lastly, I want your men to send this carcass to the guild lab. I can only answer your other question after I examined it more thoroughly."Kite's eyes narrowed when he heard the second point. 'A weapon that could kill this thing? Just who was it? I never heard gunsmith guild inventing such weapons or the agency will do anything to get their hands on it.'I have to report it to the capital, if those gunsmiths were hiding such weapon we have to force them in handing it over. Even the King might get involved to get such a weapon, and those Gunsmiths won't be able to hide it once that happened.'Despite he was shaken by this surreal event, his heart raced and a greedy glint flash past his eyes when he thought of getting such a weapon.Ville and Rose had the same thought as Kite.Suddenly, a soldier approached them."My lord, we found this stab in a tree bark in the rubble."They looked at the dark, short sword, which was extremely sharp.Kite couldn't help but take it from the soldier and then slashed it on a tree.Everyone was astonished when the tree was cut like it was jelly."T-this, could it be the Titan Iron?!" Ville had seen titan iron once, and he heard just how deadly a weapon made with it can be.Furthermore, this sword was probably purely made with titan iron, which was even more shocking."Just who were these people?" Kite couldn't help but exclaim out loud.He turned around and said, "I want this sword. I hope the City Lord won't have any problem with it. In return, I owe you three C-rank missions."He was also a sword user, and this sword was just too sharp, and he was planning to have it recast. He will be as strong as the Agency Leader with the new weapon.Ville saw through Kite's intentions, while Rose frowned because even she wanted that sword of titan iron."Alright, I have no issue. This sword will only shine in the vice leader's hand, anyway." Ville agreed, in the end, three free C rank missions were quite a good deal for him."But…" Rose wanted to fight for the sword."You have no say in it." Ville glared at her and shut her down.Rose resentfully looked at Ville before storming away.Kite was quite content and chuckled, "She's just a child. Don't worry, she'll come around."Ville sighed bitterly, "I hope so."---While the upper echelon was busy in the lion forest and curious about who was the killer of the gigantic monster, the man himself was busy in a close smithy room in the gunsmith guild.Jacob didn't sleep or rest after he returned and directly come to the gunsmith guild to make more titan bullets and also service his titan sniper.Lastly, he was making new titan swords. Since he lost one, they weren't as sharp as the hob troll's spear. He decided to recast the old one and make a new one with it.This time, he made one side of the short swords into a full chisel and forged the swords into crescent blades. He used an ancient method to reforge these blades, which he learned in his old world.He also put metal bearings in the center of two hits, so he could rotate them on his fingers to confuse his opponent.Now, whoever was stabbed by these blades will know the true meaning of pain, and he was quite confident that Titan Spear will be chipped if it clashed with these two blades.After spending twenty hours in the guild, he left silently as he appeared before taking one last glance at the building.Then he returned to this house and the first thing he did was to start the distillation process with the gnome heart and left to take a bath and pack his things.His only belonging was the titan iron bricks expect them, all the things he needed were in his pendant, which was already packed. He also had to store his blood boxes in the big black bag with the bricks because he needed to store the bullets. The space was just too small, the whole titan sniper can't fit if he didn't separate it into two small components.After he was done packing, he collected the gnome heart essence in injection and store it away before he put the mutant heart for distillation.He wasn't planning to inject these heart essences here and do it in the wildness where he could hunt the rare beasts.Jacob also studied the large map he got from the hideout, and it was surprisingly the map of entire rainy mountain ranges in the uncommon region, which was just the thing he needed the most.When the mutant crystal red heart essence was ready. He put it in a flask, and stored it away, and packed the distillation equipment in another bag.Under the shade of night, Jacob left the lionheart city without anyone noticing and started this trek toward the Rare Races Region!

Chapter 100 Dark City (1)
﻿Jacob entered the Rainy Mountain Ranges in ten days since he chose the long route because the Lion Forest was lively when he passed the area.Although he knew why they were gathering there, he didn't care what they found or what they think about this whole incident.Since he was leaving for good, he had nothing to do with whatever they found. Even if they knew it was him and somehow found out about his identity, can they come looking for him in the rare region?The answer was obviously no.Even that hob troll didn't dare to cross the Rainy Mountain Ranges without a safe route and map. This place was just too large, and once you entered deep enough, there are tons of rare beasts roaming there freely in packs or colonies.That's why no one dared to cross this place recklessly, and those who tried never came back to tell the tale.Even rare species like Glean Gnome required a safe passage and assistance to cross this place in one piece. No, all the rare races were physically strong, and they all had their unique aspects.Besides, very few rare species were willing to enter the uncommon region after risking their lives because there wasn't any worthy of their attention.Jacob found the marked passage on the map from the hideout, and, to his surprise, he seldom encountered any animals. He reckoned it was a safe passage. If he didn't have this map, it would take him far more effort to move.However, after crossing mountains and forests day after day, it took him seven months to reach the end of this passage marked on the map.Jacob still didn't encounter any rare species, and he didn't go to look for them either. He now looked slim, just like when he exited the Decker's lab, but his eyes were filled with vigorous spirit.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ He was even stronger than his bulky self seven months ago and move faster between these woods.Nevertheless, he still hasn't used the heart essences in his pendant because he was waiting for the right time.Today, Jacob's footsteps came to a halt because in front of him was a vast, active river that was two kilometers wide.Jacob looked at the lush forest and tall mountain on the other side of this river. 'So this is the border river which separates the two regions. As long as I cross this river, I'll step into the rare region. But this water current is too strong for me to swim on the other side with these bags.'Jacob frowned slightly. Although this river was marked on the map, it didn't tell where this river start or where it end. Neither did he know if there was another, safer way to cross this river.Those gnomes weren't strong enough to cross this raging river on their own. So, Jacob didn't dare to take such a risk and try to see if he could find some kind of bridge or abandon boats.However, even after walking for a few miles, he saw nothing, and the pressure of the river flow didn't decrease either.'Is there something I'm missing?' Jacob again took out the map and look carefully again.'What is this black part? I think it was just a mountain, but I'm only a few miles away from this place and there are no mountains.' Jacob frowned as his eyes shimmered with uncertainty.But he just couldn't help but take his eyes off this strange, black part.Since he didn't find any way to cross this river, he decided to check this area. It might be some kind of beast nest.As long as he can make his body compatible with 20% of his cursed mark progress, he might cross this river without sacrificing anything.This also means he needs to hunt for at least a rare beast that could alleviate his hunger faster. If he tried to do it with the uncommon animals, it might take him years.Jacob also bury his bags a few meters away from the river and marked the area with a special mark that only he can identify. He also marked the terrain on the map.After he was done, he moved toward the black mark at full speed.However, when he reached the place, he was astonished because he saw a valley that was closed with gigantic doors.'Is this some kind of secret hub?' Jacob was curious.He remembered something at this moment from Decker's journal. He had already finished and remembered who book in these seven months and then torched it since it take too much storage.Not only did he get Decker's knowledge and research as an apothecary, but he also learned some useful information about the rare region.'That fucker mentioned he bought the heart of a rat hound from some Dark City. His lab was also on this side of the river, so how could he cross it on a daily basis with his weak ass? This might be the place where he got all his equipment and ration. Those genomes were the same!'Realization dawned on him when he thought about it more carefully. Then it all started to make sense.'Why didn't humans know about this place? Or they simply didn't have the right?' Jacob couldn't help but wonder.Nevertheless, since he was already here, he won't go back without finding out what this place was and he might find something interesting if this place was like a black market.However, this place was also dangerous, since criminals like Decker can roam in this place freely, and then there were still those two giants who had him flee from Decker's hideout.If they were still here, he had to be even more careful.After deciding, Jacob sprang into action. He wore his mask and hood before he walked toward the huge close doors.When he was ten meters away, an imposing voice rang."Only Rare or above species are allowed in Dark City. If you have any identity, show it. The details will be classified. But if you're a lowly ant, scram!"Jacob's eyes turned cold when he heard this voice coming from those doors.'So, there was such a condition involved, huh? At least they didn't tell me to reveal my face.'At least now, he knew those races from the uncommon region didn't have the right to enter this place. Which made him even more curious.Jacob put his hand inside his jacket and took out a white ID card, which was none other than Decker!He never thought it would come in handy at such a time. He didn't have any ID cards from the rare region. But he can't show the mercenary agency or gunsmith guild cards because there were 'The Humane Kingdom' written in the citizen section.It means those IDs were more like a disaster than help.Suddenly, a red ray shone directly on the ID card, and the ordinary white ID card suddenly shimmered in blue light, which made Jacob's eye squint.Then the red light vanished, and the voice sounded again, "It's not fake. You may enter the Dark City. Remember the rules: no fighting, no thefts, and no provoking others. If you break any rules, the Dark City will be your graveyard."Just as the voice trailed off, a small door slid upward into the giant door.Jacob put the ID card away and moved toward the opening.However, just when he crossed the gate, he was met with another barricade. Four burly armored guards were wearing masked standing straight on the other side, armed with guns and spears.Jacob's eyes contracted when he saw the cold blue spears in their hands. He knew they were probably created with a metal like a titan iron or even stronger.As for their guns, he was even more astonished because they were all automatic AO-63 assault rifles.There was a small-masked woman in a tight dress sitting behind a glass counter. She said in her eerie voice without caring about Jacob's reaction, "10 Golden Coin for Ten Day pass. 25 Gold Coin for a month pass. 200 Gold Coins for a year pass. Which one do you want?"Jacob finally turned his attention to this small woman who had dark green skin, and he knew she wasn't a human. Even those guards have dark brown skin.But everyone's faces were hidden under masks."What kind of place is this?" Jacob couldn't help but ask.The woman answered nonchalantly,"The Dark City belongs to a neutral organization that didn't belong to any race or religion. We don't care if you are a saint or a devil. As long as you don't break our rules, we won't take action against you."We have dark cities all over the plains, and as long as you are qualified to enter, you can enjoy a safe environment and trade anything you wish according to the Dark City level."No one will ask for your identity as long as you didn't want to show it, and no one will cause trouble here, even if they are from three hegemonies. If you want more information, we have a Dark City Guild Book. You can buy it for ten silver."Now, don't waste my time and tell me which pass you want, or I'll kick you out in ten seconds!"
