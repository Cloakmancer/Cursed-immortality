Chapter 211 Rewards Of Rare Plains Trial (2)
﻿In reply, the static voice stated, "The Rare Plain Shop is only available for one-time use only for the Champion/s of a trial. In Rare Plain Shop, everything will be available as long as it exists in the Rare Plains!"The next moment thereafter, a virtual projection appeared in front of Jacob.In the top-left corner were his Star ID name and his current balance, which was 150,003 ZC combined with the 3 ZC he previously had.Below was a list, and Jacob's eyes constricted because the very first thing on the list was under the category of Level-1 Rare Authority, and there were only three items.'1. Rare Storage Ring'Size: 10 Cubic Meters'Description: A special ring with 10 Cubic Meters of Space embedded within and stored any non-living object in the embedded space.'Price: 10,000 ZC'2. Life Zone Scroll (Rare Plains)'Description: Create a 20X20 Life Zone anywhere in the Rare Plains, and no Dark Being will be able to enter.'Limitation: Only Useable in Rare Plains.'Duration: 10 Years'Price: 50,000 ZC'3. Life Limit Breaker (1-level)'Description: Break the Power level limit on the Rare Plain by One level for every Life Being. While active, any living being with the same level can enter the rare plains.'Duration: 500 Years'Price: 150,000 ZC'(AN: The 2nd and 3rd items will have reverse descriptions for the Champion of Dark Beings.)Seeing the storage ring description, lighting struck in his head, 'Don't tell me the ring I picked up was also this Rare Storage Ring?!'The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was the case because Wight Minister had taken his sword out of thin air. Before, he thought it was just a type of magic, but now that he discovered the Storage Ring's existence, he no longer thought that way.When he combined the sudden emergence of the emerald crystals at the end, he knew the ring he got was most likely the storage ring.A tingle of regret flashed past his eyes when he thought about the bone-hilt sword of Wight Minister, which he forgot to pick up in a hurry. But that sword was likely buried under that rubble, so even if he had remembered, he wouldn't take a chance with a mere sword.Jacob then took out the black ring with red patterns from his pendant. He was no longer afraid of hiding this storage ability since his pendant could also be taken as a storage pendant.He was about to ask whether this ring was a storage ring. When he remembered something crucial, he didn't even ask who he was speaking with all this time!Wouldn't the other party think he knew who it was beforehand?He quickly corrected his mistake with an embarrassing smile, "Umm, forgive my rudeness, but how should I address you?"The static voice replied without any emotions, "You may call me Star Administrator Artificial Intelligence of Rare Plains, SAAI in short!"'So, it is an AI.' Jacob was relieved since this also meant this wasn't the Zodiac Will.He then pointed toward the black ring and asked, "SAAI, what is this object?"SAAI replied emotionlessly, "1 ZC for Appraisal.'Jacob cocked an eyebrow since he didn't expect it to work, but the price of 1 billion gold coins was not a small sum either.Still, 1 ZC was not a big deal, so he nodded, "Alright, appraise it."The 1 ZC from his current balance vanished before a white ray suddenly shone over the black ring in Jacob's hand, startling him for a moment. It started to scan the ring before it vanished after a quick scan.SAAI's emotionless voice rang again, "A Rare Storage Ring."Jacob's lips curled up when he heard the answer, and he was ecstatic, "How should I open it?" He asked quickly since this ring had to have a wealth of that terrifying Dark Being!"Magic Energy is needed to open a Rare Storage Ring," SAAI revealed.Jacob's face instantly fell the moment he heard that since he had no Magic Energy to speak of, all the happiness of gaining the Wight Minister's wealth vanished in smoke.He then suddenly thought of something as he asked with cold eyes, "What if I destroy it? Will the items inside also be destroyed?""Yes. Any item below Type-1 will be destroyed if a Rare Storage Ring explodes."It was a simple answer which made Jacob grimace. Nevertheless, he would have Magic Power eventually, so he stowed it away.Then he thought of something and took out three items, a gray tatter cover book, a parchment made of beast skin, and a gray metallic cylinder.These were things he had found in the dark ruins, and he was planning to examine them when he learned the rune language. But now that he could get the answer without wasting time, he was more than happy to use that option. Especially the gray metallic cylinder."I want to appraise these three items." Jacob declared his intention while placing them on the white floor.SAAI didn't immediately reply this time but first scanned the objects in front of Jacob, which made him frown slightly, but he didn't speak.After the white scanning light was gone, SAAI's emotionless voice rang again, "The book and parchment will cost you 500 ZC each, and the cylinder will cost 10,000 ZC. Do you want to continue with the appraisal?"Jacob's eyes widened slightly when he heard the ridiculous price, especially the cylinder.'Just what the hell is this Cylinder which will cost me 10,000 ZC just to appraise? These two things are also quite expensive since a storage ring only costs me 1 ZC. It seemed the appraisal price depended on the rarity. Well, I'll ask that damn book once I leave here. It will surely know what this Cylinder is.'However, before he could say anything, SAAI spoke again, "You also have the option to sell items for ZC."Jacob's expression changed ever so slightly, and he asked, "How much will I get for these three items?""20,000 ZC for the book and parchment and 1 Million ZC for the Cylinder." SAAI emotionlessly replied.'1 Million for this Cylinder?!' Now Jacob was sure that this thing was really precious, and those two items were as precious as a storage ring.He would be a fool to let go of such items without knowing if they were helpful for him or not, so he quickly stowed them away.Jacob thought for a moment before he questioned, "How much does the Rune Language cost?"'It is a far better option to buy the rune language instead of wasting 1,000 ZC on appraisal. I'm planning to learn these damn languages anyway.'He sighed in aggravation when he thought about how his lack of language haunted him in Dark Ruins, so he wasn't planning on experiencing it anymore.As for the other two items, he didn't even think of buying them since they had no use for him. The Life Zone Scroll could only protect him from dark beings, not both, and it only works in rare plains, so it was a waste of ZC.Lastly, the Life Limit Breaker was even more worthless in his eyes since it had no use for him at all.Instead of SAAI, the list in front of Jacob suddenly changed, which made Jacob astonished because a language section appeared, and there were seven languages on the list."1. Rune Language: Type-0"Price: 10 ZC"2. Rune Language: Type-1 (Type-0 Included)"Price: 1,000 ZC"3. Magic Rune Encyclopedia: Type-0"Price: 25,000 ZC"4. Magic Rune Encyclopedia: Type-1 (Type-0 Included)"Price: 50,000 ZC"5. Philosopher's Language: Type-0"Price: 100 ZC"6. Philosopher Language: Type-1 (Type-0 Included)"Prince: 10,000 ZC "7. Language of Dead"Description: Language spoken by Dark Beings"Price: 100 ZC"Jacob was flabbergasted when he saw the prices of Rune and Philosopher's Languages which were simply off the charts for someone like him who had only 150,000 ZC.The feeling of being rich also vanished at this moment, and he understood just how poor he was.He didn't buy anything, nor dared to look for anything anymore because he knew he needed almost everything in that shop, so he decided to look for what he required the most.Only then will he think about buying another else if he left with ZC, that is.Jacob took a deep breath and said, "I want to buy Magic Cores."This was the real purpose of him coming here and clearing the dark ruins, the reaming magic cores for the last level of Cursed Heart Emergence!Jacob had already collected 3-star magic cores of all four elements from zombie hunting, and he also had a 9-star fire core which was simply a fluke. He was only missing three 9-star cores and all the 4-star magic cores.At this moment, the virtual projection changed, and the list of magic cores appeared in front of Jacob!

Chapter 212 Magic Cores Acquired!
﻿At this moment, the virtual projection changed, and the list of magic cores appeared in front of Jacob.There were all kinds of element cores ranging from 1-star to 9-star, and the rarer the element, the more they cost.At the top of the list were Light and Dark Magic Cores, which started from 500 ZC for a 1-star magic core and went all the way to the 9-star magic core, costing 50,000 ZC!Seeing all those prices, his eyes shimmered before he took out multiple magic cores he had collected while hunting, some of which were of the basic elements; they were extras."I want to sell all these magic cores," Jacob stated.Thereafter, SAAI started to scan the magic cores one after another.After a minute, SAAI's emotionless voice rang, "23,500 ZC for all the magic cores. Will you accept the trade?"Jacob found this price fair since there were 22 magic cores, all of which were between 1-star and 3-star, and only six were of rare elements like poison. So, he didn't hesitate and sold them, increasing his balance from 150,002 ZC to 173,502 ZC.Afterward, a black hole appeared below the magic cores and gobbled them before vanishing in front of Jacob's astonished eyes.Jacob inhaled sharply as he thought, 'Just what kind of technology this place had?'Keeping his thought, he started to buy the magic cores without hesitation.Thereupon, SAAI's voice rang after Jacob was done with his selection,"Three 9-Star Magic Cores of Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost; 30,000 ZC."Four 8-Star Magic Cores of Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost: 36,000 ZC."Four 7-Star Magic Cores of Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost: 32,000 ZC."Four 6-Star Magic Cores of Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost: 28,000 ZC."Four 5-Star Magic Cores of Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost: 24,000 ZC."Four 4-Star Magic Cores of Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind Elements, total cost: 20,000 ZC."After deducting the 2% discount, the Final Cost is; 166,600 ZC"Will you continue?"Jacob's expression was somewhat dark as he heard the final price because he was still planning to buy the languages and needed a new star watch.'Should I exclude four and 5-star magic cores and collect them myself? No, it would take unknown time to track all four element magic cores myself, and after the protection was lifted, it would be mayhem out there.'My strength is not enough. It would be over if I encountered someone like that dark being and more than one. Surprise attacks won't work every single time, especially if there are multiple enemies….' Jacob thought grimly before he inhaled deeply and nodded while saying, "I will continue."166,600 ZC instantly vanished from his balance states, leaving him with only 6,902 ZC.Thereafter, another black hole appeared in front of Jacob before colorful and glimmering cores started to pour out one after another.With shimmering eyes, Jacob collects all the 23 magic cores with a hint of excitement in his eyes. A feeling of relief washed over him when he saw all the magic cores in his pendant. He had taken another step closer to Immortality.Jacob also felt extremely calm as all his greed for those things in the store also quelled, and peace returned to his mind.'Nothing is compared to Immortality. I can get as many of these toys as long as I have everlasting life and even more…' Jacob thought with a peaceful expression.The next moment, he took off his star watch and Livia's, his almost destroyed titan swords, and the silver sword. He even took off ragged armor as well as the extra ones in his storage, and he wore his usual dark attire.He wasn't done; he took out half of Fire Wyvern's scaly hide, two gallons of Fire Wiener blood, and lastly, the Titan Rifle, which was completely tranquil, and there was no recoil to speak off despite Jacob being ready to receive it.This made Jacob somewhat happy. He almost emptied all the pendant space as he only kept what he deemed important and took out anything extra or something he could make again, like the titan rifle and swords."Tell me which of these things can be sold and how much will I get?" He emotionlessly said while looking at the pile of things in front.He knew this was his only chance to get whatever he needed from this place, or he had to complete another trial to get such a chance again. So, he stopped hesitating and decided to sell these things which were expendable.Especially the titan rifle, which he had high hope that he would get a high price for it. He had spent over 600 ZC previously, including bullets, to make it, and he could do it again.Furthermore, he didn't forget about his free weapon, so he didn't need those swords for now, and they were not enough for him anyway.SAAI scan every item one by one before stating, "Intermediate-Type-0 Star Watches price: 200 ZC"Broken Swords made with Basic-Type-1 materials, price: 25"Broken set of armor, two complete sets of male and female armor set, price: 43 ZC"Infant Fire Wyvern Hide (Incomplete), price: 21,000 ZC"Two gallons of Infant Fire Wiener blood, price: 100,200 ZC"Basic-Type-2 projectile weapon and components, price: 1 Million "Basic-Type-2 bullets, prices: 5,000 per bullet, total bullets 13, total price: 65 000 ZC."Finale Price: 1,186,468 ZC"Will you accept this trade?"'Now we're talking!' Jacob's lips curled up.He expected nothing less from his creation. In contrast, the revelation about the Wyvern being only an infant made him astonished and bitter."I accept." He said without hesitation.He now knows that the gun business was as profitable as he remembered it to be, and he knew what he needed to do after getting out of there as well.All the things vanished before Jacob, but his eyes were fixed on the new balance, which was 1,193,370 ZC!Without hesitation, he first commanded to change the list into star watches, and he bought the first one on the list, which was an Advance-Type-1 Star Watch with a price tag of 100,000!He knew these watches had many valuable functions, and in zodiac plains, if one didn't have a star watch, then they were as good as beasts.Furthermore, he needed a high-level star watch to gain access to the alliance shop's magic-related features, so he knew it was worth the price.A black Star Watch with like a wristband appeared as it looked extremely ordinary, like a typical rubble wristband. But when Jacob wore it an active it, it suddenly covered his arm like a liquid substance, and it was as thin as paper and looked just like black skin.Jacob was astonished when try moving his arm. He was even more surprised as he felt no resistance at all. It was like he was really wearing a thin layer of skin over his arm.Afterward, it got active; all the backup data in his account and his old star watch were downloaded within a few seconds as it shone over his arm.Jacob found many functions. He could even activate it while wearing clothes over it through the 'projection screen function' just like the projection list in front of him.Jacob decided to get familiar with it after he left here since there were some extremely unbelievable functions on it.He then opened the language list again and bought the Type-1 Rune Language, Type-1 Magic Rune Encyclopedia, Type-1 Philosopher Language and even the Language of Dead since it would come in handy if he ever decided to infiltrate the undead army again.This purchase cost him 61,100 ZC, and he received virtual copies of these languages in his star watch, which were bonded to his star ID. He can't sell them or send them to anyone else, or it would be akin to a felony.As for physically spreading it, there was no warning about it. Even if there was any, Jacob wasn't planning to share it with anyone.Then Jacob opened the weapon list, which was divided into Mech Weapons, and Magic Weapons which made his eyes shine. He didn't even look in the mech weapon section as he was only interested in magic weapons in the type-1 category now.Since his titan rifle was a basic-type-2 weapon, it should fall into the mech weapon category. However, he knew there should be intermediate and advanced ranks above it.This means type-2 weapons had firepower like titan sniper and were even more terrifying; this will also make those weapons unusable for Jacob.He didn't know how they measure a weapon's rank here, but he was pretty sure that the weapons he had never dared to publicize in his old world were common, like vegetables here.So, he wasn't afraid of standing out because of his creations anymore. He even wanted to learn more about this world's weapon technology, especially this magic weapon technology!

Chapter 213 News Spread
﻿When the magic weapon list appeared, Jacob was astonished as he saw all kinds of cold weapons with magic states.'Magic Weapon: Gray King Sword (Advance-Type-1)'Magic Qualities: 9-Star Mana Channeling of All Basic and Rare Elements.'Cost: 500,000 ZC'Magic Weapon: Spider Edge Knife (Advance-Type-1)'Magic Qualities: 9-Star Mana Channeling of All Basic and Rare Elements.'Cost: 300,000 ZC'Magic Weapon: All Element Staff (Advance-Type-1)'Magic Qualities: 9-Star Mana Channeling of All Basic and Rare Elements.'Cost: 700,000 ZCpαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ 'Projectile Magic Weapon: Fire Spitting Gun (Advance-Type-1)'Magic Qualities: Condense Fire Element Magic Bullets up to 9-Star.'Cost: 900,000 ZC'Artificial Fire Magic Bullets for Fire Spitting Gun: 1-Star to 9-Star Quality'1-Star Fire Magic Bullet Cost: 100 ZC per bullet'2-Star Fire Magic Bullet Cost: 500 ZC per bullet'…'…'9-Star Fire Magic Bullet Cost: 10,000 ZC per bullet'Jacob was flabbergasted when he saw a gun among the magic weapons, and when he saw the details, he was even more astonished.'I have no clue that there was this type of gun out there which could condense magic bullets. Furthermore, this advance-type-1 gun had only a specific element that it could channel, unlike those cold weapons, which can channel every rare element.'So, to speak, magic weapons are also made with specific elements as well as they are all rounded. But for projectile weapons like guns, it seemed all-rounded element magic quality couldn't be achieved in type-1 rank.'I need to learn more about these things, especially magic, and get familiar with the technology. This shop is my best shot at achieving this without getting myself affiliated with anyone….'Jacob's eyes shone as he started looking for a suitable weapon for himself. He didn't have the magic power to condense magic bullets nor the capital to buy artificial bullets, so he didn't go for any projectile weapon.The cold weapons were his best shot since they could also be used without magic power, and when he had the magic power, he could fully bring out their potential. He had already seen and experienced just how deadly a magic weapon being used with magic power is in his fight with Wight Minister.There were even magic resistance armors in this shop which also drew his attention, but he was confident in making something like that with the Wyvern hide he kept for himself.In the end, Jacob stopped at a point as his eyes shimmered while looking at the item on the list.'Magic Weapon: Doom Assassin Short Swords (Pair) (Advance-Type-1)'Magic Qualities: 9-Star Mana Channeling of All Basic and Rare Elements. Mild Stealth Effect if used with Dark Element.'Cost: 1,500,000 ZC'Sheaths Cost: 20,000 ZC'Jacob looked at the pair of short swords with dark gray blades and black hilts with a crystal skull at their bottoms.Without hesitation, he said, "I want to use my free weapon chance on Doom Assassin Short Swords!""You have active One Free Type-1 Advance Weapon privilege!" SAAI's emotionlessly declared.Thereafter, a pair of exquisite short swords were delivered.Jacob took the sword, and he was astonished because they were not light but heavy, probably over 1-ton. The dark gray blades were one meter long, and two inches wide as a strange pattern was engraved on the blades giving the feeling of icy sharpness.'Once I'm done modifying the hilt, they'll be perfect for using my Deceptive Swords Style. No wonder that guy could send me flying, and his strikes were so heavy. His sword should also be quite heavy and on the same rank as this pair.'A hint of regret flashed past Jacob's eyes when he understood just how precious that sword would've been. He could've sold it for a steep price if he had just picked it up!Nevertheless, this feeling was only fleeting as he stowed away the pair of new swords.Jacob then closed the weapon list without hesitation since he didn't need to spend his money on the magic weapons which he couldn't use, and he could make mech weapons. He would like to spend his money on the things he was in grave need of.The first thing he bought was a Type-1 Universal Magic Manual which had every basic and rare element detail about magic and magic spells, costing him 250,000 ZC!But Jacob didn't feel the pinch since he knew such a manual might not be available outside or even cost more.Then Jacob also bought a manual related to Magic Weapon Crafting for 100,000 ZC and two encyclopedias called Universal Magical Materials (Type-1) and Universal Beings [Living & Dead] (Type-1), so he won't be ignorant about what he was dealing with, and unknowingly charges right into his death like in the dark ruins!All these things were virtual, so his pendant space was still empty.So, after he was done with the knowledge, he started to search for materials for his next big project and new titan sniper. The titan iron in this shop was of the highest quality. One couldn't be found in the rare plains, and it was much cheaper than from the outside, not to mention an immense amount.There were other materials he wasn't familiar with, but they were even more expensive than advance-type-1 titan iron, like ice crystal steal, which cost 100 ZC for 1 gram, or bloodstone ore which cost 500 ZC for 1 gram. In comparison, the titan iron was 20 ZC for 1 gram only!Jacob thought for a moment before he bought 20 KG of titan iron and a small quantity of ice crystal steal.Lastly, he bought something he knew he wouldn't find anywhere, or others might not even sell it to him if they knew what kind of things they were…In the end, Jacob was only left with 590 ZC, but he had this satisfied look in his eyes as he said, "I'm done!"SAAI's emotionless voice rang, "Faceless Ancient has decided to leave the champion space on the date XXX and time XXX!"The next moment a dark hole appeared, which was the size of a door, and Jacob knew it was his cue, so he didn't dwindle and entered the passage as he couldn't be more familiar with it already.After he left, the dark hole closed.SAAI's static voice rang again, "Information of the Type-1 Plain Sole Champion has been released to the Life Faction Mainframe!"---Far away from the Rare Plain,Two giant black flames suddenly ignited inside a mysterious space filled with crimson mist. They gave feelings of maliciousness and terror, and a dark projection appeared suddenly thereafter.A ghostly being been kneeling as it said in its spooky voice, "The Rare Plains trial had been clear, my Liege, and somehow the Life Faction had claimed the victory by clearing the trial in less than a year!"The black fire flickered brightly as the crimson mist around started to churn.A corporeal voice with a mixture of male and female sounded, "Appoint a new overseer and get rid of the old one. Sent 7,000 Extraordinary Zombies, 1,000 Half-Lich, 1,000 Half-Wight, 500 Lich, and 500 Wight!"The ghostly being was shocked as it hesitantly said, "My Liege, won't it be meaningless now that those ants can freely enter there in mass? The next trial is about to descend, and we could use those 10,000 soldiers to create an advantage. Therefore, we should just abandon those useless fools!"As the black fire slowly started to die with the crimson mist, the voice said, "It would only make those pests stronger if we weren't there to keep them in check, and the same goes the other way around. This force will be enough to occupy them, and those pests won't dare to shift their focus because the trial is about to descend."The ghostly being remained silent for a moment before respectfully saying, "I shall do as you bid, My Liege!"---In another palace, inside a large bright room filled with gentle light, an otherworldly beauty was sitting around a table as she looked at the three-small projection in front of her with a peaceful expression."I assumed you three had received the news already?" The woman impassively said in her melodious voice."Yes, I was just contacted by the overseer, and it is out of everyone's expectation." A man in blue robes in one of the projections sighed."Indeed, who would've thought those idiots would be able to clear a trial in the span of over seven short months? If I didn't know them better, I would've thought they were playing us for fools." A burly man in red armor chuckled."Heh, it is quite clear whoever was behind it; those four idiots have no idea about it since the champion didn't use the life zone protection nor the limit breaker. So, we can assume he had no belonging to the rare plains." A gentle-looking male sneered coldly.The woman impassively said, "From my resources, it appeared that person had killed an Extraordinary-Tier-6 Wight to claim the final shackle. That person might be of some help to our trial here if it could clear the rare plains trial in less than a year."That's why I want to use our three-organization authority to buy its information from the SAAI!"

Chapter 214 Preparation Of Ritual
﻿In the middle of a tropical forest, a black hole suddenly manifested before it started to grow bigger and only stabilized when it was the size of a person.Thereby, a black-clad person wearing a hood walked out before the black hole vanished.Jacob couldn't help but take a deep breath as he somewhat enjoyed the fresh scent of nature. He didn't know where he was, but it sure wasn't the gloomy Dark Woodlands.He then tapped two times over his wrist before a projection materialized. It was his new star watch with a projection feature. But it was only one of its minor functions.Jacob had already made himself familiar with this star watch while he was still in the dark space.It can not only send messages but also receive calls and video calls; there was even something like a projection call in this thing. Not only that, but this watch also had a radar and mapping function, and a powerful one at that.This star watch's most astonishing function was its magic detection ability. As long as Jacob activated it, then it didn't matter if someone was living or dead. As long as they were in a 10-mile radius and had magic, they will appear as color dots within a virtual map.The limit of this feature was 9-star!Jacob had never thought the Star Watch could do this, and just this feature alone makes it indispensable for Jacob.Jacob activated the magic detection feature, and a virtual square map projection appeared, but it was empty, and a loaded icon appeared with a one-minute timer.'It scanning the surrounding area?' Jacob was astonished as he patiently waited.A minute passed before a green 3D map appeared, and Jacob could easily see terranes and zoom anywhere he wanted.There was nothing with magic in a 10-mile radius around him, so after fiddling with the map, he closed it since this feature was more useful in places like dark ruins.Then Jacob activated another map, which was actually the entire map of the Rare Plains which he had bought for 10 ZC from SAAI. Furthermore, this map was not an ordinary map, but a GPS Map connected to the star network.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ This means as long as he had a star watch on, he could easily determine his position and use it for navigation or set up routes on this map.Strangely, the GPS was not available in the star watch. Even Jacob's advance-type-1 Star Watch didn't have one.Upon asking, SAAI revealed the GPS Map was only available to someone like Jacob with Type-1 Star Privilege, and it was none shareable!Jacob quickly determined where he was on the map, and he frowned because somehow, he had appeared on the outskirts of the Magic Beast Forest, which was in Rare Wilderness and was also the central region of the rare plains.From here, the Freedom Plains and Wild Nation were one year of travel away!'Well, it's not like I need something from that place anyway. It might be a good thing since I was planning to travel far away from that place. Since the barrier is lifted, those two factions are bound to fight tooth and nail with each other.'Especially the dark beings who seemed to have an advantage over the rare plains before. However, now that the living being from the other plains can enter infinity and dark beings' number has become limited, things might turn worse for Dark Beings.'They will definitely be curious about who cleared the trial, and those bigwigs would also know about the benefits that came with clearing the trial. So, I need to keep a low profile until there is no threat remaining for me in rare plains…' Jacob's eyes shimmered coldly.Without wasting any more time, Jacob headed north to find some secluded place. The magic beast forest was insanely large, as large as both freedom plains and wild nation combined or even larger.Jacob didn't want to pick a fight with magic beasts in this place since he was in their territory, not until he needed to.After hours of carefully searching, Jacob finally found a location that was actually a small waterfall. However, with his current strength, the water pressure was nothing to him, and he cut open a cave right behind the waterfall with his new swords.He knew what he was about to do; he needed absolute secrecy and couldn't be careless. So, he made a large enough cave to create the ritual array formation and blocked the entrance again with stones.After he was done, Jacob didn't spring into action immediately but rested as he ate more wyvern meat. He wanted to be in optimal condition before he started the ritual.He slept for an unknown time before he woke up as he felt refreshed and energetic and all his fatigue from the dark ruins was behind him.Jacob's eyes turned sharp as he said, "Cursed Immortality!"It had been months since he summoned Cursed Immortality, and he never thought he would be able to survive without its guidance. But he did, and now he knew too much relaying will only do him more harm than good. Still, this didn't mean he won't use his assets just because of his ego.Cursed Immortality manifested, and a string of familiar laughter appeared, "…hahaha… you sure take your sweet time to summon me. I started to feel rather lonely!"Jacob pursed his lips, "Cut the nonsense and tell me why can't I summon you in the dark ruins? Are you afraid to be detected, or places like dark ruins can completely block you off?"Jacob was quite interested in this topic since it was related to Zodiac Will."Aren't you had enough fun while in dark ruins? Why don't you ask that AI? She might be able to answer you!"Jacob's lips curled up, "So you weren't blocked, but afraid. Got it. Now on to main business, tell me how much space I need to set up the ritual array formation!"

Chapter 215 Cursed Heart Emergence (1)
﻿Jacob's lips curled up, "So you weren't blocked, but afraid. Got it. Now on to main business, tell me how much space I need to set up the ritual array formation!"Immortika clearly didn't mind Jacob's jeering words, nor did it refute them, as it replied like usual, "Heh, afraid or not, you'll know in the future, and trust me, I'll be there when you figure it out! "Anyhow, as you said, on the main business. Since you have already collected all 36 element cores, all you need to do is to correctly arrange those cores exactly as the diagram in the scripture. This room should be enough."You can also draw an outline before setting them up, and then all you need to do is to sit in the core of the array formation. It will automatically trigger the moment your cursed mark is detected."The cursed mark is actually the key to activating this ritual formation. Without it, it's nothing but a drawing."A fair warning, though, there are four phases of the final level, Activation, Spread, Incorporate, and finally, Cursed Heart Condensing. You won't feel pain in the first and second phases. But when the incorporate phase starts, you will feel an unimaginable pain far worse than you felt when you complete the second level."You have to endure the pain while remaining conscious because the moment you lose your consciousness, the ritual will stop, and all the element cores will turn into dust after creating a terrifying explosion."Afterward, you have to collect the cores all over again if you managed to survive that it. As for the last phase, it will all depend on yourself whether you can cross it…hahahah!"Jacob felt a chill run down his spine when reading the part about the pain and explosion and the subtle fourth phase. He had this feeling before that he won't be getting out of it without pain and could only sigh and succumb to his fate."Thanks for the heads-up." Jacob sneered coldly before he turned the page.______[First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Heart Emergence (First Stage)]-Cursed Heart Emergence: Three Levels---First Level: Formation of Immortal Mark Inside the Modify Heart (Complete)---Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark (Complete)---Third Level: Cursed Mark into Cursed Heart[Description (1): Collect four Primary Elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind) Element Cores (Magic Core) from 1-Star to 9-Star.]-Fire: 9/9-Water: 9/9-Earth: 9/9-Wind: 9/9[Description (2): After collecting all 36 Element Core, create the following Ritual Array Formation.][Decryption (3): Sat in the middle of this Ritual Array Formation.]---Completion of this stage will cause 'Agelessness of Heart'______Jacob opened the Ritual Array Formation diagram, which was in the shape of a large pentagram, and within this pentagram were triangular points. All he had to do was to arrange the cores as described according to the diagram.There were even magic core elements and levels described on each point, so there wasn't any room for error.Jacob quickly sprang into action as he first drew the outline of the diagram on the cave floor and then carefully started to place the element orbs, one after another.The dark cave was lit in colorful lights at this moment as a thick element aura filled the air.With shimmering eyes, Jacob looked at the empty center within the colorful cores, and he knew the moment he sat there, the ritual would start."This is it, right?" Jacob questioned sternly."Yes, there is no error. Now hurry up before those low-level element cores run out of element power, and oh… don't die. I don't want to be in this cave!" Immortika wrote."Hmph!" Jacob sneered coldly before his clothes started to vanish from his body. He was now completely naked, and only the infinity pendant remained around his neck.Jacob then approached the center of the ritual array formation and sat down.The very next moment thereafter, Jacob felt a throb in his heart, and the magic cores suddenly started to glow brightly.Colorful lines started to condense from the magic cores, and one by one, those magic cores connected with the magic cores one after another. When the formation was completed, the entire cave was glowing.However, Jacob's expression was rigid because the moment the formation was active, he felt like he was stuck in his spot as he couldn't move despite trying.The circle where Jacob was sitting started to light in all kinds of light at this moment before those multiple lights started to eclipse each other until nothing but the black color was left!Jacob felt palpitation in his heart as he clearly felt a dark, coldness start to seep into his body and slowly cover every inch of his immobilized body. His calm heart suddenly started to race, and he had no control over it whatsoever!Thereafter, Jacob clearly feels the coldness in his body start to gather within his heart as the formation shines brightly. Soon, Jacob's entire body felt icy. He even imagined himself being frozen slowly.But he didn't lose focus since he knew this was just the beginning.Within Jacob's body, a dark infinity symbol was shining in a dark sheen as it was slowly getting inkier. Most importantly, it was spreading, covering Jacob's crimson heart in its inky black color from the inside out.The more the cured mark spread, the colder Jacob felt.He had never thought when Immortika said the first and second phases were not painful, it meant they were even worse than pain. Because if this coldness kept increasing, he might lose his mind before he could endure any pain.But the strange thing was there was no sign of freezing, and Jacob could also see this, so he told himself that it was merely an illusion and endured.However, when an hour passed, Jacob felt like he was sitting at the bottom of an icy lake, and he couldn't even move. His breathing was heavy, and he couldn't feel his body or heart at this moment.But everything changed when the third phase started!

Chapter 216 Cursed Heart Emergence (2)
﻿Jacob's skin was as pale as a corpse, he had lost all the feeling in his body as he was barely conscious, and his vision was blurry.He never thought he would succumb to the freaking cold of all things, and he had this feeling that this wasn't even really cold. It was the strange energy seeping from the ritual array formation.Right at this moment, when Jacob was almost on his limit, a warm current suddenly spread from his heart.If he could look at his heart right now, he would be shocked because his heart had turned inky black. A strange crimson sheen started to emerge over his heart, and with every beat, this crimson sheen was covering his blood vessels.Jacob was completely indulged in the warmth spreading in his body, and his pale skin regained a rosy luster.However, Jacob abruptly opened his eyes when he felt the temperature rising. His eyes dilated when he saw himself engulfed in a crimson sheen.Before he could figure out what was happening, his eyes suddenly went wide, so wide they were almost on the verge of breaking out of their sockets.At this moment, Jacob's black heart slowly started to twist, and Jacob could feel every moment of it as he wanted to scream, but his body was utterly immobilized except for his eyes.The ritual array formation suddenly started to turn crimson from colorful and strange glyphs surfaced within the formation. It was the start of the third phase!But Jacob didn't even notice the huge change in the formation because his eyes were completely bloodshot. He could feel his heart kept twisting.The strangest thing was there was no blood or anything, but just pain, a pure unimaginable pain.'I can't take it… I can't take it… NO…. No, I need to remain conscious, or it will be over… I will not be going to die again… NEVER…!'Jacob started a mental war with himself, a part of him wanted to give up because of the pain, and a part of him wanted to fight.Jacob didn't know how much time had passed, but for him, it was forever, but the pain was only increasing, not lessening. In reality, only ten seconds had passed since his heart started to twist.At this moment, his heart didn't look heart at all as it was completely twisted and still wasn't done. Furthermore, the pretzel of the heart didn't affect any other function of his body as everything was working like nothing was happening.Even his blood flow wasn't disrupted.As his heart continued to twist, Jacob was on the verge of instantly, but he didn't lose consciousness as he had already decided to remain conscious at the expense of his sanity. If it was what he had to pay for Immortality, he will pay it!As more and more crimson energy poured into his heart, it continued to twist further and faster without breaking or damaging.The heart continued to twist and compress until nothing was left of it but a twisted one-meter-long thread, completely detached from his blood vessels. The only thing keeping Jacob alive was the crimson energy that was keeping his nervous system running.Jacob didn't even feel anything anymore as his eyes were completely blank despite being wide open as he was staring at the void.The black thread, which was also Jacob's former heart, suddenly started to bend and took the shape of '8,' which was the shape of the infinity symbol.The moment the infinity symbol was complete, a dark mist was released from it before it started to mend the symbol, before nothing but a smooth infinity symbol was left without any flaws.The infinity symbol was as large and wide as his heart, and it remained in his heart's place just like any normal heart.The very next moment, all those detached blood vessels started to magically connect to the black infinity symbol under crimson energy's guidance, only after another.The final phase had started!But Jacob was still staring at the void with a blank look on his face, despite the pain already being over.Suddenly, the crimson formation started to change color again and slowly turned black, and the glyphs also began to change.This time, those glyphs didn't provide any energy, but they slowly started to move toward Jacob like ants and crept over his body.There were 36 black glyphs that were moving over Jacob's body and slowly making their way toward his chest, toward his heart.As the glyphs were leaving their place, the formation also started to dim down from point to point, leaving nothing but the dust of magic cores behind.At this moment, clarity returned to Jacob's eyes; he was in a daze because he wasn't sitting in a dark cave, but he found himself sitting around a large table filled with all kinds of delicious foods.Three boys were sitting on his left side while a gorgeous woman was on his right side."Why are you not eating? Is there something wrong?" The beautiful woman asked in a gentle tone filled with love and concern.Jacob snapped out of his daze as he turned his cold eyes toward the woman and shock surfaced as he blurted, "Who are you?""What are you talking about? I'm your wife!" The woman replied with concern, "Do you need me to call the Doctor? You're not behaving like yourself?"Jacob couldn't help but look at the woman with uncertainty and called with doubt, "Hope?""Did your brain finally give up after you used it for all that research? You even forget about your dear wife!" Hope pursed her lips."Hehe, Dad is acting silly." A little boy around the age of three or four laughed frivolously.Hope couldn't help but giggle before he lovingly chided the boy, "Little Zainy, don't be disrespectful, or your grumpy Dad will ignore you again!"Jacob also glanced at the little boy as he remembered it was his youngest son, Zain. But he was no longer the mature man as he had last seen him.Beside Zain was a teenager with a firm look in his eyes, just like Jacob. He was William, the oddest son. Beside him was another boy from the age of 13 to 14; he had the cold mature looks of Jacob. He was Ryan, his second son.However, despite seeing all of them, Jacob didn't want to believe there were here for some reason. He even remembered all of his memories of the zodiac plains and what he was doing before he woke up here.That was the major cause of his doubt, and the more he looked at his old family, a strange anger welled up in his heart."You are not Hope, and you three are not my sons. Just who are you, and what kind of game are you playing?!" Jacob instantly stood up as he was feeling uneasy. This feeling was coming from his heart.Hope suddenly lost her smile as shock surfaced on his charming face before she quickly approached Jacob with deep anxiety, "Why are you behaving this way?! I'm going to call the Doctor. There is something wrong with you. Let me take you to the bedroom so you can rest until the Doctor arrives."However, Jacob felt even more uneasiness when Hope approached him and quickly dodged her hands; it was like he was facing his natural enemy."Immortika, what kind of trick are you planning?!" He roared in indignation as he looked at Hope's teary eyes and his kids' concerned and appalled expressions.But he didn't feel any sympathy but loathing. He thought he was losing his mind since he knew even if he turned into a monster, he would never feel loathing for Hope, no matter what.Yet, here he was, trying to avoid her like she was some kind of disease, and it was all because of the scary feeling in his chest."Dad, why are you making Mom cry?" Zain innocently uttered with teary eyes."Why are you acting such a jerk!" William also chimed in with an angry look as he held his mother's hand."I'm going to call Doctor Greyjoy, Mom; please don't cry." Ryan gently said before he shot a cold glance at Jacob."Hahahah…" Jacob suddenly laughed out loud at this moment. His eyes were filled with coldness as he regained his indifferent demeanor."I don't know what kind of trick you are planning, but you have done a lousy job while making those four copies. Now I'm sure this is some kind of illusion."That prick book said the fourth phase depended on me, I thought it was talking about pain, but now that I'm seeing this illusion, it seemed what it meant was this shity test!" Jacob grimly stated as he looked at his family, which only gave him a feeling of hostility."Since this is an illusion, all I have to do is to wake up!" Jacob's eyes went ruthless before he flashed toward the glass window."NOOOOO… stop!"

Chapter 217 First Phase: Second Stage
﻿Within the dark cave,At this moment, 36 tiny dark glyphs covered in crimson sheen were gathered on Jacob's left breast, and surprisingly those glyphs were arranged in the exact pattern as the ritual array formation.All of a sudden, those glyphs started to be absorbed within his chest, and one after another, they started to brand the infinity symbol, vanishing thereafter.When the last 36th glyph got branded, the crimson sheen on Jacob also vanished, and thereby, the new infinity heart started to beat, and with every beat, it discharged a red glow.Thereupon, clarity started to return in Jacob's blank eyes.Assorted emotions shimmed within those amber eyes before anger took over. However, he was startled when he found he could move his body, and the cave was completely dark.Before he could investigate the situation, he felt his entire body sour; a sudden feeling of emptiness and exhaustion washed over him, and his eyes turned extremely heavy. He wobbled a bit before he fell backward, and without realizing it, he was sound asleep.Immortika's impetuous eerie voice suddenly rang, "Heh, this ought to do it…"---After an unknown time, Jacob's eyelids trembled before they were opened, revealing his confused eyes. But the confusion was only fleeting before they regained clarity.'Rubmleee…'He was caught off guard by powerful rumbling in his stomach before he felt extreme hunger wash over him, which was as terrifying as he remembered it to be.He quickly picked himself up but was shocked when his hand literally pushed into the stone floor like it was made out of wet clay.'My strength has increased!' Jacob's eyes shimmered as he was using exact same force he was used to before.He then controlled his strength again before he was able to pick himself up, and without wasting time, he started eating the Wyvern meat.But he was soon astonished when he found the meat no longer gave the feeling of burning his internal organs, nor could he feel the fiery energy within anymore.There was nothing but gentle energy flowing throughout his body within his body at this moment, and the speed of digestion was far faster than before. It was as fast as when he consumed a rare tier of meat.'Don't tell me I need a terrifying amount of energy again to make my body compatible with my heart again, just like in the injection process.' Jacob grimaced as he thought about it while eating.The more he ate, the more he knew it was likely to be the case. Because the hunger was slowly getting subdued, but it wasn't anywhere near quenched despite him eating over five pounds of Wyvern meat which was enough to keep him functioning for weeks before.Still, Jacob didn't stop, as he could visibly feel it getting stronger with every passing second. He also noticed that his eyesight was getting better and better as he could now vaguely see in the dark cave, and his hearing and other senses were also increasing.The strangest thing he noticed was his heart because, for some reason, his heartbeat had changed, and it was simply too vague, and his control over his heart rate somehow reached a terrifying level.Because after he tried, he could completely stop his heartbeat with a thought, but for some strange reason, his blood flow wasn't disrupted, and he didn't feel any danger despite his heart getting stopped.He could even breathe normally, which was completely abnormal. It was like his heart was a completely different organ of his body which was now completely under his control.The scariest thing that had changed was the fluid acceleration because Jacob could now enter in 7X acceleration and exit it within a second.'Just what of change had happened to my heart? My entire body seemed to work perfectly despite me stopping it for a whole minute!' Jacob had an appalled yet excited expression.However, he didn't dare to test the limit of this heart-stopping ability since he might really die without being able to start his heart again.Afterward, he continued to eat until there was nothing left of Wyvern. But Jacob still felt slightly dissatisfied. But the feeling was now very faint, and he reckoned that 95% of his body was now perfectly matched his newly strengthened heart.Yet it was still shocking that even after eating a tier-6 extraordinary Wyvern, his body was still not perfected.Nevertheless, Jacob was feeling boundless strength coursing through his veins.'I'm clearly in the rank of extraordinary physiques now. But why the hell I still can't feel magic? Won't Immortika say no one can enter extraordinary rank without a 3-star magic core?' Jacob thought with uncertainty."Cursed Immortality!" He tried summoning the book since he didn't know how much time had passed since he fell unconscious.But he was hoping for the book to appear since he wanted to confront it about that strange 'dream' since he knew it was too real to be a dream.Furthermore, he had to commit suicide before he was awakened from that dream which was evident that it was some kind of illusion, not a dream.Not only that, but he had the feeling that nothing would happen to him even if he jumped from a fifty-story building, or he would never dare to try committing suicide.But for some reason, he trusted that feeling even to put his life on the line, and in the end, it played well in his favor.Still, he wanted to know what was that and why it happened right in the middle of the ritual.Lastly, the first stage of the first phase had been completed, so he wanted to see the requirement for the next stage.At this moment, Cursed Immortality appeared afloat in front of Jacob, and his eyes shone with anticipation as he opened the first page.______[Cursed Immortality: Cursed Immortal Physique (Nine Phases)][Current Phase: First Phase]----First Phase: Body Transformation-Stages of Body Transformation: Three-First Stage: Cursed Heart Emergence (Compete)-Second Stage: Cursed Blood Condensing (Current)-Third Stage: Compete Second Stage----Inheritor: Jacob Steve-Current Phase: First (Body Transformation)-First Stage Progress: Complete-Second Stage Progress: 0%----Lifespan: 250 Years (All Youthful)______Jacob's squinted his eyes when he saw the new stage, 'First heart and now blood? Well, it won't be too painful as the heart, at least I hope so.'But when his eyes fell on his lifespan, happiness filled his heart, '250 and all youthful? Is this the effect of completing the first stage?'Whichever the case was, Jacob was thrilled to see his lifespan increasing, which was all he wanted. He felt all his suffering was worth it.Jacob then quickly flipped the page to see the Cursed Blood Condensing Stage's requirements.______[First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Blood Condensing (Second Stage)]-Cursed Blood Condensing Progress: 00.00%[Description: Convert your blood into Cursed Blood until it reaches 100% completion by Absorbing the Heart Blood of Legendary Beings or their decedents.]---Completion of this stage will result in 500 Years of Lifespanpαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ ______'Legendary Beings' heart blood or their decedents? I should've seen this coming…' Jacob pulled a bitter smile when he saw the requirement.Although this stage didn't have any levels since something called a legendary being was involved, Jacob knew this stage was going to be even harder than the first one.He then flipped the page before his expression turned frosty as he said, "Before the explanation at this stage, I want to know what that dream was, and don't even try to pretend you have no idea about it!""Oh, is there something wrong? I clearly have no idea what you are talking about." Immortika wrote.Jacob frowned, "I fell into an illusion where I see my old family, but somehow 'my heart' told him they were not real and I should just die to escape that place before it was too late."I know you knew something since you said the fourth phase will depend on me. So, stop pretending and out with it!"Jacob won't believe for a second Immortika didn't know what it was. He knew this book was like an omniscient existence, hiding terrifying secrets.However, Immortika still denied it, "That might be some sort of dreaming effect you experience because of the pain. Still, I'm shocked you have the guts to commit suicide…hahaha…"Jacob gnashed his teeth since he knew it was impossible to make this book talk, so he could only drop the subject. But a seed of doubt had been planted within his heart, which won't go away no matter what.He then inhaled deeply before he asked, "Then what's the deal with my heart, and why can it be stopped while my body works just fine, and what's the limit? Lastly, how strong am I?""Before that, I have good news for you. Just like before, after you complete the first stage, my summoning time has been increased from 1 hour to 3 hours."Lastly, the infinity pendant's ten cubic meter space has been increased to 25 cubic meters!"

Chapter 218 Legendary Rank
﻿Jacob wasn't surprised at all since he had already noticed the change in the infinity pendant when he accessed it for the meat.As for the increased time in Immortika, it was also quite good since it could easily track down hidden enemies around him accurately. He didn't trust the Star Watch scanner completely."Heh, I started to miss your expression a little." Immortika wrote about seeing Jacob remain indifferent.Jacob merely sneered, "If you have time for this nonsense, why don't you answer my questions? Then, I might actually be surprised.""Oh, you will be going to surprise. Let's start with the Cursed Heart. Your current heart is no longer the heart you're familiar with. Its shape, structure, functions, and purpose had been completely changed after you completed the first stage."Firstly, your heart cannot age any longer, which means it would never weaken no matter what, and as a result, you will naturally experience some changes in your body."Your heart, in particular, is no longer just for pumping blood or keeping you alive. It is a new organ that has all the functions of your heart, as well as some that transcend it."Like you just experienced that you can stop your heartbeat but still can breathe as well as your blood flow also won't get affected by it. This is also one of the perks of a cursed heart."Most importantly, a Cursed Heart is the foundation of the Cursed Immortal Physique, and without it, you won't be able to move forward in the scripture. You could say it was one of the biggest hurdles on your way to immortality!" Immortika wrote.Jacob's eyes shimmered with a hint of ecstasy when he read to this point.Immortika continued, "As for its limit, it is had virtually none, but this didn't mean your other body part would be able to handle it. That's why your lifespan is only 250 years right now. It is the actual limit of your body. So aging is no longer your concern."As for your strength, when your hunger is completely gone, you should be as strong a peak of Extraordinary-Tier-6 life form, and your body will be able to handle 15X acceleration."Speaking of which, your fluid acceleration should no longer be a threat to you as long as you won't exceed your body limit because your heart rate is now completely under your control. You just need some practice to get familiar with it."Jacob's lips curled before he asked, "Then why didn't I have any magic right now? You said yourself that no one can enter the extraordinary tier without a 3-star magic core.""Heh, do you really believe you're like others?" Immortika didn't reply but questioned instead.Jacob pursed his lips, "Fine, you win." He knew asking was useless since he already had guessed this much. He wasn't like others because of Cursed Immortality."I told you, I'm not a magic book. You're on your own in that field!" Immortika wrote."Fine, now about the second stage?" Jacob questioned with a solemn look."Cursed Blood Condensing is a relatively straightforward stage from the first stage. All you need to do is either squeeze the blood out of a heart or just eat it raw. Both things result in the same conclusion."Your new heart will do the rest as it will automatically be activated once you consume the heart blood of some legendary being or anything closely related to one until all the blood in your body is converted!"Jacob frowned, "What are legendary beings?"Although he was happy about the simplicity of this stage, he knew the true terror lies within the legendary beings he required the heart blood of!"Hahaha, you might've already guessed it. Legendary is the Sixth Rank of the Power System in Zodiac Plains. Common, Rare, Extraordinary, Epic, Unique, and then Legendary."Above Extraordinary is Epic Rank with 9 Tiers, then above Epic is Unique, with 9 Tiers. Lastly, Legendary Rank, it didn't just have Tiers but different states as well."First State, Fable Legendary State, which had twelve tiers."Second State, Legendary Noble State with nine tiers."Third State, Legendary Lord, with six tiers."Fourth and last State, Legendary King State, with three tiers."I will only warn you here, you better not even dare to think about going after a Legendary Rank expert, even a Fable Legendary of First Tier, because even if you used the strongest weapon in your mind, you will only get obviated!"Even a First-Tier Unique Rank can easily kill you without lifting a finger. Such an example will be the Infant Fire Wyvern you managed to kill."A Fire Wyvern had four growth stages, Infant, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It was born extraordinary, became epic in childhood, reached unique in adolescence, and Fable Legendary in adulthood!"Jacob felt palpation just when he read about the Wyvern and felt like he had a closed shave with death, and if that Wyvern was in its childhood stage, then he was most likely dead already!"Ignorance is bliss…." He mumbled hoarsely."Hehehe, exactly. If that Wyvern were awake, you would die without even getting a chance to play any trick despite it still being in the infant stage."Still, you managed to hunt a creature with a Legendary bloodline and potential, which also explained the decedent part. All you need is to search for creatures with a legendary potential and bloodline like that Infant Fire Wyvern!"Jacob's eyes suddenly went wide when he thought of something. He quickly asked, "Then does this also mean….""Yes, the Wyvern heart in your pendant will be sufficient to convert your blood significantly. Since it had over 90% chance of becoming a Fable Legendary, you might annex one of Fire Wyvern's innate abilities like its fire magic talent!""What?! Are you serious?" Jacob was baffled as he lost his calm demeanor. This was simply too unbelievable for him.He never thought the Wyvern heart he was storing for another purpose would have a use for him."Hehe, why would I joke with you about this thing? A Legendary creature like Wyverns had a complete Fable Legendary Bloodline, which gave them over 90% chances of reaching the Legendary Rank and granted them terrifying innate abilities."This will also grant them natural superiority over those who are born from a unique species and had no destiny with the Legendary Rank whatsoever. Even those with a diluted bloodline of legendary rank species couldn't compare to a complete Legendary Bloodline."In your case, as long as you consumed the hearts of someone with a complete legendary bloodline while being in the second stage of the body transformation, you will have a small chance to annex an ability through their heart blood."But then again, such creatures will be protected by their kin like treasures, not just lying around in some graveyard for you to assassinate. So, I suggest you don't have your hopes up or try going after them in your greed."Besides, you can't continuously consume the same type of heart blood. The effect will be a 90% decrease with each consumption until you don't receive anything."Jacob felt a bucket of bold water pour on his head as all his excitement died down, and he regained his cold demeanor again.Nevertheless, he was still thrilled since he already had a chance to acquire something that only someone with a complete Fable Legendary bloodline would have. Not to mention he can instantly convert some of his blood into cursed blood.However, he didn't dare to act recklessly since he was still feeling lingering hunger, and if his hunger increased after he consumed the Wyvern's heart, then he might fall into danger.So, he was planning on hunting some magic beasts first to complete his body compatibility with his current heart, and only then can he consume the Wyvern heart.Jacob couldn't help but look at the cursed immortality and question, "Then this also means that such a bloodline will only exist in those Unique Species, right?"pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ "Why, of course, not just any specie can become a Unique Species. A good bloodline played a very important part in it. An epic race will need luck to become a Unique Rank, while for a Unique to Legendary Race, even luck can't help them. You have to do your research. I can only help you with this much!""What about their magic capacity?" Jacob squinted his eyes. This was the biggest threat in Jacob's eyes."Hehe, since this stage didn't involve magic, then I can't tell you anything about it. You're on your own. I have already answered your questions related to the second stage as well as revealed benefits. So, don't be greedy!" Immortika mockingly wrote.Jacob frowned, but he didn't dwell on the matter since he knew this was where the book had drawn its line. Now he was on his own again.Jacob then closed the book and stood up from his position. He had bought many things from the dark ruins, and it was time to study them.But first, he needed to quench his hunger fully!

Chapter 219 Still Not Avail…
﻿A blast suddenly occurred, but its sound was completely masked by the waterfall ahead.A cave passage appeared, and a black-clad person with a mask and hood walked out and stopped at the edge. Jacob looked at the falling water ahead, which was dark; that could only mean there was no light outside, nighttime.However, Jacob wasn't bothered by it since his vision was almost at the level of night vision, and he assumed that once his hunger was gone, he would not have to worry about darkness either.'This place was really excellent for hiding. A pity I need to abandon it so soon.' Jacob sighed ruefully before he jumped ahead with full force, leaving a cracked cave entrance behind.Thereby, Jacob's figure directly shot past the small waterfall, and he appeared right above a river stream, and because of the force, he was still moving forward. It was like he was flying.'I'm definitely stronger…' Jacob's lips curled up behind the mask as he enjoyed the feeling of floating.But it didn't last long as after fifty meters, he started to fall and directly entered the river below. This river was actually one of the river branches of the Great Star River.If he continued to travel beside this river, he would end up in the Great Star River. But Jacob is not planning on leaving the Rare Plains yet. At least not until he figured out about the Magic.Since he already knew about the Epic, Unique, and terrifying Legendary Ranks, he didn't want to overestimate himself and get killed by moving forward without having any knowledge about Magic.It was pretty easy to guess that Magic was an essential part of the higher species and was also needed if someone wanted to evolve further.So, Jacob was planning to live in the central region of the Rare Plains, far away from the Freedom Plains and Wild Nation, since those two regions would be at each other's throats right now.As for living in the wilderness, he didn't need to because, with the GPS map of the rare plains, Jacob also got all the location information in the Rare Plains, which was hilariously large.But the most crucial location he got on the map was the location Dark City in the central region!Jacob was quite surprised when he saw the Dark City in this place. He never thought it was located so far away from the Freedom Plains. If he had searched for it on his own, he might've never been able to locate it.Nevertheless, he was planning on going to the Dark City since that place was much more reliable than other organizations, and he could also freely trade materials there.While he was heading there, Jacob was planning to hunt as well as evaluate his rank in the Zodiac Warrior Alliance. Of course, he didn't forget about his permanent membership.Especially after his encounter with SAAI, he knew these three hegemonies were the best 'markets' for him after a champion shop. Furthermore, he needed to make ZC and a huge amount of it so that he won't fall into a pensive state like in the champion shop.Jacob then left the river and entered the forest ahead. He opened his Star Watch virtual projection and determined his location and then his destination, which was the Dark City.It was four months away from his current position, and it was deep into the magic beast forest, probably in the core area.'What a bunch of lunatics to build this city right in the middle of magic beasts' nests.' He thought wryly.Afterward, he opened the Zodiac Warrior Alliance Mission Application to see if the missions were still the same or had changed.'Welcome to Zodiac Warrior Alliance Mission Application!'Now corresponding missions according to your rank can be chosen from the star watch application, and a warrior rank can be improved directly through the star watch!''Zodiac Warrior Alliance ID: Faceless Ancient'Current Rank: 1-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight (Reserve Zodiac Warrior)'Next Rank: 2-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight'Mission' Jacob clicked on the mission section without hesitation.'Mission'Promotion Mission Available: 3'(NOTE: Complete any one of these missions to promote!)'1.

But he felt pity that he couldn't hunt down Dark Beings here, or he could amass a high number of ZC.Nevertheless, he knew better than to be greedy. Dark Beings were nothing but trouble, and he was content with magic beasts and raising his ranks.Furthermore, he wanted to see if he would be picked by the alliance to take into a higher plain if he cleared all the Nightmare Warrior Knight Ranks, according to Nixon.Then Jacob remembered something, opened the Alliance Market, and tried opening the Combat Techniques again.Last time he was shunned because his star watch didn't have a mana detection function, but this star watch was far above any star watch present in the Rare Plains.Now the question was if he had mana or not. Still, he was quite anticipatory.However, he frowned darkly when,"You have no Mana. Therefore, this section cannot be opened!"

Chapter 220 First Promotion
﻿Jacob didn't know how to feel as he looked at the notification with a rather dark expression.'What the point of me using so many ZC on this watch if I can't even use its true functions properly!' He frowned with a regretful look.He then closed the alliance market and opened the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual. This thing was even more expensive than his Star Watch, as it cost him 250,000 ZC!According to its introduction, this manual had every basic and rare element detail about magic and magic spells. Lastly and most importantly, the reason why he bought this expensive manual was it had full guidance on Primary Stages, Sensing, Using, and Storing!However, Jacob was almost cured when he opened the manual and saw the words; they were all in rune language, and he couldn't understand a thing."I should've known!" He sneered with an angry look in his eyes as he closed the manual and opened the languages he had bought from the champion shop.This time, he was determined to learn every freaking language before he opened those other books to save himself trouble later.As for his surrounding, despite his focus on his star watch, he was completely alert, and his senses were at a terrifying level. Especially his hearing, he could even hear tiny insects crawling from hundreds of meters away, much less if someone wanted to ambush him.On the contrary, he wanted some beast to ambush him by showing his carelessness and opening. This way, he could save himself the trouble of finding them as well as he would quickly absorb his gains.That's how he started to learn the Rune Language first, which was quite complex, but he was shocked when he discovered his learning capabilities had increased to a terrifying degree.He almost had a photographic memory as he could easily remember everything, even if he just glanced momentarily at the text.Jacob was elated since he knew it should be one of the benefits of his cursed heart, so he learned with even more enthusiasm and a terrifying speed.There was a total of 33 alphabetic in type-0 rune language and over 300,000 words combination. But Jacob remembered them and their meanings quite fast as he walked slowly within the thick forest.However, after walking for 10 hours, he didn't get ambushed by anything, and it was already morning. Still, Jacob was full of energy and was still learning the type-0 rune language, which was almost done.Jacob was quite astonished after he was done with the type-0 rune language. He also discovered that the once foreign words he had seen in the dark ruins were now comprehensible.Especially the riddle in the second secret room.'Dignity is nothing before Love! So, that's what it meant by those words, huh? What a strange way to put it. Still, I don't know what to do without knowing the answer to those riddles beforehand.' He smiled wryly.Still, he was astonished since he could easily understand those words after learning just the type-0 rune language.Previously, he thought that he would only understand the language in the dark ruins after he learned the type-1 part, but he seemed to have misgiving about the Type-0 and Type-1 ranks.'Could it be the type-0 rank represent anything under the ranks of Common and Rare while the Type-1 is Extraordinary or even Epic…' Jacob mused with shimmering eyes.Without wasting more time on mulling, he opened the type-1 part of the rune language. He knew the answer to his question lay within the materials he already had.Because if this was true, then those type-1 materials were not rare but extraordinary!Jacob was under the impression that type-1 rank was for rare and only type-2 rank should be for extraordinary, which should be normal since there was a type-0 that easily could be synonym with the common rank.But if his new conjecture was true, then Type-0 could be equivalent to Common, Rare Ranks, or even Extraordinary. But the chance of Extraordinary being included in the Type-0 Rank was almost null because it would be too unbelievable since then Type-1 be the Epic rank.This was the Rare Plains, so just the Extraordinary Rank existence was abnormal here, much less the Epic Rank.In type-1 rune language, there are 66 new words and over 3 million words combination, which is a lot for anyone who wants to learn a new language and does not have a good memory or comprehensive ability.But for Jacob, it was only slightly challenging but not difficult as he annexed the information like a bottomless abyss.Unknowingly, Jacob had been walking for four days, and he was already deep in the outer region of the magic beast forest.At this moment, Jacob was still walking while completely focused on the projection over his wrist, and he was still avoiding any trees in his way without looking.There was a small map projection at the corner of this projection which had an outline of a selected route, and Jacob had been following this route while continuing his study of type-1 rune language.However, his focus was broken for a moment before he continued, but his lips moved up slightly under his mask.He suddenly closed the file in front and opened the alliance app and directly selected the second rank-promotion mission, and selected 'Star Recording!'The projection on his wrist instantly vanished, and he knew the recording had been started.This star watch had this 3D recording function, and he knew he didn't need to point it at anything, and it could record anything within a 10-meter radius around him.The videography technology of this Star Watch was quite advanced, and the photograph technology was the same.Jacob even mussed that if he had tried to record with his other star watch, that function might not work as well in this application since that watch didn't have the 3D recording function, which could show the entire fight without any loophole.'What delightful timing, I was just feeling hunger!' Jacob smiled as one of his newly acquired Doom Assassin Short Swords appeared in his right hand.The moment the dark gray sword appeared in Jacob's hand, a silhouette appeared over Jacob's head, and it was over three meters wide!Without even looking, Jacob slashed his sword vertically as its terrifying wind whistle sounded and the wind was raised in the vicinity.The next moment, the huge silhouette split into two and landed into two pieces right in front of Jacob.His attack was so fast and powerful that even Jacob was surprised when he saw the evenly cleaved beast lying in its blood ahead. Even its bones were cut clean!It was a purple color Ape with a yellow patch of fur over its chest and head!"A Rare-Tier-9 Purple Ape?" Jacob identified the beast but then frowned because a purple app didn't have anything remotely yellow on its skin.Still, he decided to stop the recording and try sending it back and see what happened. Because he was sure that this ape was at least tier-9 rare rank since it was able to sneak on him within a few seconds after he detected its movement five hundred meters away!Jacob was going to start gutting the beast since he thought it would take a while before he received some kind of reply from the alliance. But he was baffled when his star watch vibrated after ten seconds he sent the video."Your Promotion Video Recording has been verified!"You have killed an Extraordinary-Tier-2 Purple Vile Ape!"Reward:"1. Rank Promotion to 2-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight"2. 100 ZC,"3. One 2-Star Rare Fighter Skill"Available Missions has updated!"'How efficient.' He clicked his tongue and had to admit that the alliance was really worthy of its title as the strongest hegemony among the three.Jacob then checked his new missions, which were changed according to his rank.'Zodiac Warrior Alliance ID: Faceless Ancient'Current Rank: 2-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight (Reserve Zodiac Warrior)'Next Rank: 3-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight'Mission'Jacob clicked on the mission section without hesitation.'Mission'Promotion Mission Available: 3'(NOTE: Complete any one of these missions to promote!)'1.
