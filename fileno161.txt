Chapter 161 Golden Swords Country (2)
﻿The Golden Swords Country had a foundation over thousand years old and was divided into five provinces named East Golden Sword Province, West Golden Sword Province, North Golden Sword Province, South Golden Sword Province, and the Center Golden Sword Province.The Golden Swords Country was under the control of Golden Swords Military Dictatorship and each province was governed by a Governor-General, and different districts of these provinces have many ranking army officers overseeing them.In fact, calling the Golden Swords Country, a military country, won't be an understatement.The Golden Swords Country was mostly famous for its naval forces in the Star Ocean, and no one dared to mess with them in the waters.The White Ocean Navy Base was one of the three biggest naval bases of East Golden Sword Province and closest to the Star Ocean. It was the entrance toward the Golden Swords Country from the Star Ocean.If someone wanted to go further into the plains, then there was the Great Star River, which was twenty-time larger than the common river of the common plains, and it spread all over the plains.But unlike the Common River, the Great Star River was still mysterious and wasn't fully explored.Anyhow, a medium size battleship entered one of the bays of White Ocean Base while dragging a small black ship behind it.Many Seaman Recruits were standing straight on an empty dock to receive this battleship.There were also two figures standing at the end of the dock wearing completely different uniforms than those Seaman Recruits and looking at the incoming battleship."Here they come, Senior Chief Officer." A being with a gray, malevolent wolf's head snarled. His height was 1.9-meter-tall and furry humanoid body. He was a Wolf-Head Orc."Do you think I'm blind, Chief Officer?" The Senior Chief Officer sneered coldly. He was a middle-aged Bigot Barbarian.There were many intelligent and unique species on the Rare Freedom Plains, but the species with the most populations were Orcs, Barbarians, Trolls, Goblins, Gnomes, and such. These races produced the fastest, while they weren't the most powerful ones because their bloodlines were mixed and thin, so their offspring seldom reached the potential of their parents.While there were those races who seldom mate with those outside their races and kept their bloodline pure like Giants, Elves, Dwarfs, Kobolds, and such. But they have the smallest population since it was hard to produce offspring for them because of their strong bloodlines.Nevertheless, these races were still terrifying despite their short numbers, and no one dared to mess with them since they were also overprotective of their own."But seriously, did they really find a stray Rare-Tiere-7 Fighter out there?" The orc asked curiously."At least that's what the report says, and he's going to join our ranks as well." The barbarian coolly answered."Do you think he'll be appointed in our department since we found him?" The orc questioned again."Do you take me for an answering machine? Ask the Deputy Admiral yourself." The barbarian answered with exasperation.Thereupon the ship finally docked, but no one noticed a dark blur jumping on the other side and vanishing in the shade of night.Soon, Milan, followed by Jacob, disembarked the ship before the others.Milan had an amiable smile on his face as he was saying something to Jacob."So, this is the White Ocean Base I told you about. What do you think?"Jacob looked around and saw many battleships, even larger size battleships, were docked there, so he had to admit Milan wasn't joking when he said it would be foolish to pick a fight with them in the water.Although those ships were much more advanced, he was more apprehensive about the people driving them."No bad, but I don't want to work in here. I had enough of ocean adventure for a while." Jacob plainly uttered without hiding his true intention.Milan chuckled, "Heh, and here I thought we'll be seeing each other more. It's a pity then."Jacob merely glanced at the old man, saying nothing. He could feel this old guy wasn't simple and amiable as he seemed, and he didn't dare to let his guard down around him.In a sense, Jacob felt they were the same kind of people because they knew how to hide their intentions pretty well.Nevertheless, Jacob didn't feel any hostility from Milan so he wasn't too much worried and just wanted to be done with this registration and get out of this base as soon as possible.He also saw the huge metal gate in the moonlight which was closed, and he could guess it was probably the way to the Great Star River.When they stepped on the stone dock, the orc and barbarian approached them which made Jacob somewhat startled when he saw the wolf head orc. He still wasn't used to seeing people with animal heads walking around.They both respectfully perform an army salute, "Deputy Admiral!""At ease, at ease." Milan amiably replied, "Chief Officer, this is our guest, Sir. Jack prepared the best food and a room for him."He then looked at Jacob and said, "You were on a long journey, my friend. I'm sure you're sick of eating seafood, especially those horn fishes which taste terrible. Rest for a night here and enjoy our hospitality. We'll talk about the official business tomorrow. If I haven't had to report this, I would've loved to join you."Jacob also didn't want Milan around him, so he nodded. "I understand.""Please follow me, Sir. Jack." The orc politely uttered as he was looking curiously at Jacob's mask which he was still wearing.Soon, he led Jacob away, and Milan headed toward another military jeep with the barbarian Senior Chief Officer.Jacob wasn't too shocked seeing those vehicles since he had already read about them, and he knew rare freedom plains were already advanced into the engine age. He was even glad to see a familiar means of transport since he wasn't used to those horse carriages."Where to, Sir?" Senior Chief Officer asked while taking the wheel.Milan coolly replied, "To the main office. I'm sure there's a meeting waiting for me there."Senior Chief Officer solemnly nodded and drive toward the Main Office of the base.---The main office was in the center of the white ocean base, and it was a tall twenty-story building. Even though it was night but the building was brightly lit with military lights like the day.Inside the top floor's meeting room, three people sat around a table in military uniforms as well as giving off a suffocating aura.At this moment, the closed door suddenly pushed open, and a 6.4 feet tall figure entered wearing a navy uniform. His face was extremely handsome, with glossy white skin and long golden hair.His eyes were also golden but icy, and only his pointy ears were out of place, or he looked completely like a human. This was one of the strongest species present in the rare freedom plains, the Golden Elf!Those three figures quickly stood up seeing this elf and performed a military salute. "Admiral Xavier!"Xavier merely nodded and took the chief seat. "Sit down, gentlemen."The three figures slowly took their seats.Xavier spoke again before they could. "Let me give you a summary of today's events before you ask meaningless questions."First, the Earth Slayer is most likely dead, and this person Faceless Ancient killed him and took the black ship for himself. So, we didn't get the chance to capture a high-ranking skull this time."Second, this Faceless Ancient is clean. I saw him operate his star watch, and he didn't have any badges of three hegemonies so we can make use of him with no worry."Third, his species is probably new in Rare Freedom Plains, and I haven't found any traces of Magic on him, or he would've sensed me. So, he might be a pure fighter type as well, but it is still yet to be seen until we put him through some tests to make sure he had magic potential as well."Now, expect this information. You can ask any question." Xavier coolly stated."Since the identity isn't a problem, then all that is left is to appoint him into a department." One of the three stated in a rough voice."I want to hear the admiral's thoughts on how we should use this new asset?" A sweet voice rang in question.Xavier plainly replied, "Let him go through the Nightmare Knight Legion entrance test. They will do everything for us and measure his true potential. As long as he is appointed as a 1-Star Nightmare Fighter Knight, we'll send him to the military base on the border of the wild nation to kill those pests."But if he had the magic potential and assign as a Rank-1 Nightmare Magic Knight by the Nightmare Knight Legion, we'll send him to the Central Province to nurture him properly.""Indeed, an excellent suggestion. We need magic users, not meat shields. West Golden Sword Province agrees with this proposal!""North Golden Sword Province also agrees.""South Golden Sword Province agrees as well."Xavier nodded. "This meeting is settled, then!"

Chapter 162 Golden Swords Country (3)
﻿The night passed peacefully, and the next morning, Jacob's eyes opened in a spacious bedroom.Although he looked asleep, he was on high alert, and the moment he sensed something, he could instantly react. He had formed a habit of sleeping like his in the ocean. He could even sleep in a meditative state now.He still wore his mask and hood since no one asked him to take them off, but he knew he had to show his face eventually, and his appearance was quite catchy.So, he decided to make it less catchy. He went into the bathroom and then took off his mask, clothes, and armor, revealing his face, long shining silver hair, and body.The next moment, a sharp knife appeared in his hand, and the next moment, he started shaving his head until he was completely bald.But he wasn't done. He then started making scars over his head and face like battle scars. Although they looks fresh, he knew with his current recovery ability of his body, they would soon start to fill and look like old wounds.Until they're completely filled, he would be long gone from here, and everyone would think he was just a scar-filled warrior, just like the picture he painted in front of Milan.After he was done with the makeover, his entire body was dyed red in his own blood, but he remained expressionless. He then took a bath, washing all the bloodstains, and just as he thought the bleeding was already stopped.Now, he looked in the mirror and saw his own hideous scarred face and head. He looked nothing like before. But he was still not done as a small vial appeared in his hand which was filled with a dark inky substance.He opened it and painted his eyebrows black with it, and now no one would suspect that he had silver hair. He was planning this for a while, and this was the easiest way to fool any authorities. Even if he fled this place, he could easily restore his appearance, and no one would guess who he was as long as they didn't check his star watch profile.'Knock…'A knock rang on the door at this moment.Jacob donned his armor and clothes, as well as his mask and hood. He looked just like yesterday without revealing his face.Then he opened the door and saw the wolf-head orc standing outside in his uniform. He politely said, "Sir Jack, Deputy Admiral, invites you for breakfast.""Alright, led the way." Jacob nodded and followed the orc toward the exit of the building.They soon embarked on the military jeep and drive toward another large group of buildings.The White Ocean Base was quite large, and there were many buildings and barricades around to stop intruders from invading and no army personnel from wandering.Soon they entered a military compound where many army guards were patrolling.The Orc Chief Officer led Jacob to a large building that was filled with Golden Swords Navy Officers.Jacob looked around the building, and it was just like a typical army building with many corridors and rooms.When they reached a closed door, the Orc Chief Officer knocked before Milan's voice sounded, "Come In."When they entered the room, it looked like a dining room, and a table full of different dishes with stemming oozing from them was there. Around this table sat Milan and another creature.He had dark gray skin and a brawny build with a menacing face with a deep old scar on his bald head. Jacob instantly identified this creature as the Mountain Troll which was quite famous in the rare freedom plains.Furthermore, this Mountain Troll was probably more powerful than Milan as Jacob could feel slightly threatened by him, which he never felt from Milan."Chief Officer, thank you for bringing our guest. You may leave now." Milan amiably smiled toward Jacob, "Come, my friend, I put together this feast for you since I wasn't able to join you last night."Jacob nodded in acknowledgment and took a seat around the table. But he wasn't in the mood to eat because he could feel a faint hostility from that troll who was glaring at him for some reason.Milan also sensed the tense atmosphere and quickly introduced the troll, "My friend Jack, this gentleman is from West Golden Sword Province, District Secretary Douglas. He'll be your handler for your appointment in Golden Swords Country."Secretary Douglas, this is Friend Jack I told you about. He's an Ascetic Expert far from here and will be joining our big family. Please go easy on him, for my sake."Jacob nodded in plain greeting. "Secretary."Douglas also nodded in acknowledgment. "Mr. Jack, pleased to meet you."Milan smiled in satisfaction when he saw the introduction go well, "Alright, let's have breakfast before we talk about official business."Douglas merely grunted in agreement.While Jacob's lips curled slightly under his mask, 'So, they wanted to see my face while putting up this façade of friendly breakfast? If I don't show my face, they might think I'm hiding something and become suspicious about my intentions.'No one knows if that was what they truly were aiming for, but Jacob came prepared for this. Even last night, he didn't dine with others to not reveal his face.If Milan had asked to see his face when they met, Jacob would've had no choice but to reveal it since he was caught off guard at that time.Furthermore, he was already in the other party's home ground now, and even if they asked directly to show his face, he wouldn't be able to reject it unless he wanted to turn hostile.Only upon coming here did Jacob understand he might only just scratch the surface of the rare freedom plains' four powers, and tier-8 fighters like him might not be as rare as he thought them.Nevertheless, as long as they didn't have an extraordinary act, he didn't mind playing along with them for now.Jacob took off his black mask just as though Milan and Douglas's eyes flashed with light as they glanced at him simultaneously.But when they saw Jacob's scare-filled face, they were astonished and wondered just what kind of experience he had gone through."What? Never seen a warrior's face before?" Jacob sneered coldly before he started eating without caring about the other two."Heh, you're more like us barbarians with those glorious markings on your flesh." Milan laughed happily as he also cared little about appearances.Douglas also nodded, as he also cared little about appearances.Since they both confirmed that Jacob wasn't some wanted man and didn't belong to any known species, they were more at ease since this could make Jacob's vagabond background even more solid.Douglas suddenly spoke, "Mr. Jack, if you don't mind me asking, what are your species? If you don't want to reveal it, please pretend I didn't ask. I'm just curious since your skin color and trails were like elves, but your hair and ears are different from theirs."Jacob expected this kind of question so he was prepared in advance and said, "I also didn't know what my kind is since I was born and grown in a small village far away from here in the wilderness. But we all called ourselves Faceless Ancient, so it's all there is to it."Jacob knew there weren't any humans present in rare plains, so he just pretended to be ignorant about his race and used that annoying name as a sham to trick them.His name had already been revealed, and he knew it wouldn't be long before society would know he was here. But when he thought about how the Golden Swords Country hated them, he didn't mind letting them take care of those skulls for him.They won't let them attack one of their personnel within their territory, or they would turn into a laughingstock of the rare freedom plains if the news got out."I see." Douglas nodded in understanding, but it wasn't clear if he believed Jacob's story or not.Afterward, no one asked questions and they all have a peaceful breakfast before Milan led everyone to his office, which was right beside the dining room.After they all sat down, Douglas finally spoke business. "Mr. Jack, since you don't want to be in the navy, we won't force you, and that's why they sent me here as well. But first, I want to make one thing clear to save us the future misunderstanding.""Please speak freely." Jacob nodded.Douglas said, "Since you were not born in Golden Sword Country and didn't have any family, or species living or registered in our country we have to register you as a new species and will give you Level-2 Citizenship which we only give to a family member who had lived in our country for at least fifty years."But according to the new species citizenship law, you have to serve the Golden Swords Country for Fifty Years as well!"

Chapter 163 Agreeing To Demands
﻿"But according to the new species citizenship law, you have to serve the Golden Swords Country for Fifty Years as well!"Jacob's eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, "Can you explain this 'Serve' in detail?"Jacob had long expected this coming because he knew they wouldn't just give him freeway in their ranks without restraining him. Jacob would be more suspicious about their true intentions if they could let him join and then leave as he pleased.Although Milan had also told him about this level-2 citizenship But that old fox didn't reveal the details and let Jacob enter their base first, where he had no choice but to agree to their conditions.Furthermore, things were moving quite fast, as if they had already decided how to handle him, and this also revealed another cunning aspect of Golden Swords Country's upper echelon.Douglas plainly replied, "When I say 'Serve,' it meant your service in the army before you could retire or continue with your rank. But fifty years' service is a must for you."If it was an entirely new tribe of new species who wanted to join the ranks of our country and benefit from us, then they had to serve in the army for a hundred years before they would allocate a territory in our country."Furthermore, this service is not slavery if you have this concern, and we won't work you to death. You just have to complete army assignments sporadically. You will be given corresponding rewards and many more benefits that the army provides its excellent members."Jacob went silent for a moment before he asked, "You have another option for me, right?"Douglas's eyes widened ever so slightly when Jacob quickly saw through him. He was indeed right since this was just a hard choice before Jacob would give an easy option.This would raise his chances of choosing that easy choice tremendously that the country had already selected for Jacob and wanted to manipulate him into it!Milan smiled wryly on the side. He had already experienced Jacob's sharp intuition, and he warned Douglas not to play with words so much, or he might get seen through.Jacob wasn't a wild stray as they made him just because he never came to the rare region. Just his strength alone was enough proof of his survival capabilities.Douglas nodded, "Indeed, Mr. Jack had guessed right there is another chose which won't require you to serve for fifty years in the army or face any danger, and you'll earn full backing of the country and resources.""What do I have to do?" Jacob asked curiously."You just need to go through the Nightmare Knight Legion entrance test, and if your result is satisfactory, we'll gladly offer you this choice and even more," Douglas stated impassively."So, you're saying this second choice depends on this test result? But what if I didn't get the results you expect me to get?" Jacob questioned. He knew what kind of place the Nightmare Knight Legion was, and this was the only power between three hegemonies which whom he had yet to come in contact. So, he could guess this test might reveal something about this true potential or something related to his species, which he didn't want at all, not without knowing what they were planning or what this test actually did.Douglas had expected this question as he said, "In that case, you have to serve for fifty years before you're allowed to retire with a level-2 citizenship."Let me explain about our citizenship first before you decide."When level-2 citizens have offspring in our country, they are considered level-1 citizens, and they are required to serve in the army for ten years to raise their citizen level the same as their parents."However, to rise from level-2 to level-3 citizen required excellent merit and a level-3 citizen offspring born as a level-2 citizen, which means they didn't need to do any services in the army and live a life free from worry."As for level-4 citizenship, it's the most difficult to acquire, and only a few people have it, and they're all leaders of our country."If you managed to get those expected results, then you'll be given a level-2 citizenship directly and even have a chance to acquire level-3 citizenship," Douglas explained patiently.Jacob wasn't moved in the least bit by this level bullshit since he wasn't planning to spend his life here. So, getting this citizenship or not matters little to him."What about if I don't want citizenship in your country at all? I mean, let's be clear, I didn't commit any crime against you, neither I have any grudge against you, and I'm a free man."So, you can't force me to join your ranks, and that's why you gave me these excellent choices, and I'm flattered. But I'm more adventurous, and fifty years of my life is far too long for me."Since you guys give me a passage and show your hospitality, I'm in your debt, but it won't be called for fifty years of my life now, are they?" Jacob sharply questioned.Although he was willing to lower his head, it might get cleaved if he lowered it too much. Furthermore, since they're talking about law, he wanted to see how much regulation they could bend when it came to their benefits.Douglas's eyes narrowed when he heard Jacob's unexpected response because in rare freedom plains, anywhere someone goes, they had to abide by these rules unless they didn't want to live in safety of rare freedom plains."Mr. Jack, I agree with what you just said, and we won't own you just because we give you a lift. However, I would like you to reconsider this choice because they would have the same conditions even if you join some other power."Unless you want to live in the Rare Wilderness Plains, which are filled with unknown dangers and those vile evil creatures who were enemies of all living beings like us."This unexpected comment left Jacob baffled because he did not know what they were talking about.Douglas sensed Jacob's confusion as he plainly said, "It's only natural that you didn't know about those evil creatures since they exist on the rare plains, and we've all been fighting them for centuries."However, I can't reveal this top-secret information before you join our ranks, and if you still want to leave, then you're free to go, but you can't enter our cities without our citizenship."Jacob fell into silence when he heard this because he could feel Douglas wasn't lying about this danger or whatever he was talking about. But he was definitely lying about his inability to enter their cities.After all, there were still three hegemonies, and he didn't believe that those high-ranking members were their citizens as well, but the question was, would they let him come in contact with them?Furthermore, he was now absolutely sure that they didn't want to let him come in contact with three hegemonies, and he wasn't sure if he could leave here in one piece if he really tried to escape.So, Jacob chose the most straightforward option and saw what happened. "It seemed I was being ignorant and too arrogant. So, alright, I'll choose the fifty years' service."Douglas was again baffled by Jacob's choice since going through the second choice won't put Jacob at a disadvantage, but if he succeeded, then he would gain an advantage.Milan, who was silent for all this time, finally spoke. "Jack, don't choose too soon because if you really choose this option, then you're not allowed to join any branch of three hegemonies until your fifty years' service is over.""Why is that?" Jacob's voice turned somewhat cold, as if he was angry. This was utterly cutting him off from their knowledge."It's also in the contract that no citizen below level 2 could join three hegemonies. So you can see these laws in the other three nations as well, not just us. But if you agree to the second option, we'll let you join the nightmare knight legion, and you can also gain access to their resources." Douglas revealed.'What the fuck is with these twisted laws?' Jacob was exasperated by all these strange laws and why those three hegemonies were putting up with all this in the first place since they were all high and mighty.They were simply letting these four nations control them as they pleased while taking advantage of them. This made Jacob even more curious about what was going on here.'I don't know how they will hold these contracts, and if they're valid in other nations as well, then I can't just desert them. I need a clear graph of the situation, and the Nightmare Knight Legion might give me some leeway.'Jacob sighed and agreed in resignation. "Alright, you have convinced me. I'll take this test!"

Chapter 164 On The Road To…
﻿After Jacob agreed to take this entrance test, the meeting ended.Afterward, Jacob and Douglas bid Milan farewell since Douglas was about to lead Jacob toward the largest city of east golden sword province, where he would be taking the entrance test of Nightmare Knight Legion in two days.But this was just a temporary stop for Jacob because whether he passed or failed, he'll be instated in another province far away from the navy.However, Jacob didn't know that the East Golden Sword Navy was the safest army unit of the Golden Sword Country, and only a few even got the chance to enter the navy, which he rejected without knowing.While in a moving military jeep, Jacob questioned Douglas sitting beside him, "Since I agree to join your ranks, can you tell me what those evil creatures you were talking about?"When Douglas revealed this strange secret, Jacob was curious and wanted to know what could make the four nations fight for centuries.Douglas glanced at the soldier driving the jeep and coolly said, "Let's wait until you finish your test Mr. Jack; there's no hurry. I don't want you to lose your focus."Jacob's eyebrow spasmed slightly, but he didn't raise this topic anymore.So, he changed the subject to anything he was curious about, "Then can you tell me about the Nightmare Knight Legion test and what ranks they had and what kind of rank I needed to pass this test of yours?"Although Jacob knew the Nightmare Knight Legion existed in the common plains, he still hadn't had the chance to come in contact with them and what kind of ranks they had.Furthermore, those mercenary ranks of common plains also didn't apply in rare plains, so he was curious about how they measure power level here and if they have different grades for those with Magic.Although Jacob hadn't met anyone with magic power yet in rare plains, he knew they weren't strange to this concept but hiding this information from those who didn't need to learn about it.This time Douglas didn't dodge the question and asked curiously, "I seemed the place, Sir. Jack came from didn't have nightmare knight legion?""You could say that, but I do hear about their fame and name." Jacob nodded.There wasn't any information about the three hegemonies on the star network as well, so admitting it would only make it more transparent that he was just a bumpkin and let others underestimate him even more.Douglas's eyes shimmered in realization as he said, "That also explains why Mr. Jack didn't have any identity badges of the three hegemonies."Well, it doesn't matter, Mr. Jack. There's no need to worry about anything. Although Nightmare Knight Legion is the most difficult to join, it shouldn't be a problem with your current power."As for their ranks, there is the lowest rank, the Reserve Nightmare Knight, and after it is Rank-1 Nightmare Knight to Rank-9 Nightmare Knight. But all these ranks are for common-tier species."For Rare Tier Fighter Species like us, the ranks changed into Star ranks. To achieve 1-Star Nightmare Fighter Knight, one needs at least a physical strength of 500 tons, and the age should be below 100 years."The threshold to cross the 1-Star Nightmare Fighter Knight is having a strength level in Kiloton (1 KT= 1000 Tons). But it's too hard to achieve. We only know that there are up to 9-Star Nightmare Fighter Knight Ranks."The most powerful Nightmare Fighter Knight record in our Rare Freedom Plains is 4-Star, and that person is the current spokesperson of the entire Nightmare Knight Legion in all four nations, and he's belonged to the Iron Giant Tribe of Iron Sierras." Douglas's voice showed a hint of reverence as he revealed the open secret to Jacob. Jacob was astounded when he heard this because he didn't dare to imagine just what kind of physical strength this 4-Star Nightmare Knight would have, and all his confidence of having the physical strength of over 800 tons vanished into smoke.He felt his decision to remain submissive was an absolutely right one.He also discovered something from Douglas's speech as he questioned while pretending to be ignorant, "You said these ranks are for Fighter Species like us? I have read an article on the Star Information Sea that said there are two specific categories, Fighter and Wiser, and there's no information about Wiser Species. So what is this all about?"Douglas wasn't surprised by this question since he knew this kind of information was really on the Star Information Sea, and anyone could find them as long as they were curious about the ranks.Furthermore, the Nightmare Knights Legion entrance test will expose this exact element about Jacob to them, so he had to explain this no matter what. Besides, when Jacob joined their private star server, he was bound to come in contact with that information."Since Mr. Jack will soon join our ranks, I don't mind revealing this classified information."The Wiser Species has something to do with supernatural powers which we called Magic!"To be called a Wiser Species, it required sensing the presence of Magic which is, in fact, elements like fire, water, soil, wind, and such around us. Therefore, the higher tier a wiser species is, the more proficient they are in controlling Magic."We measure this magic power with something called Magic Measuring Device, but that device could only measure the presence of Magic that has already been awakened. It could not tell if someone had the potential to be wiser or not."However, the Nightmare Knight Legion had such a device, and now you might understand why we want to take the entrance test." Douglas meaningfully stated with an impassive expression.'I knew it!' Jacob's eyes flashed intensely, but he pretended to be surprised, "I never thought such powers existed in this world. I was too ignorant and arrogant."He took a deep breath before he said with a hint of anticipation, "So, as long as I have this magic potential, I'll get Level-2 citizenship directly?"Douglas wasn't surprised seeing Jacob's expression since anyone would be excited after learning about Magic. However, he also knew the more disappointed one would be when one found out they had no destiny with this fable concept.Nevertheless, it was still yet to be seen if Jacob's species had such potential, so some essential figures of the country were secretly paying attention to Jacob.Douglas replied impassively, "Indeed, a Wiser species is quite rare in rare freedom plains, and they're considered strategic resources, so they were also given the most lavish treatment as well. I hope now Mr. Jacob won't hold back on us. We all are doing this for everyone's sake."If Mr. Jacob also has the potential of Magic, then you'll be appointed as a Rank-1 Nightmare Magic Knight Instantly. Even the Nightmare Knight Legion treated a Magic Knight quite generously and trained them with everything they had."As for higher ranks and deeper knowledge of wiser species, you'll know if you become a magic knight, or this information would only be meaningless to you." He stated plainly."I understand." Jacob pretended to be pumped while, in reality, he was feeling confused.'Immortika said every rare species could awake an element or something like that, but this guy saying this device could reveal one magic potential, yet they're still rare.'Immortika won't lie about something like this. So, this device is clearly flawed. I wondered if it could detect my yet-to-be-awaken element?' Jacob mused gravely.Now that he had confirmed his doubts, he knew there was ample information he wanted out there, and all he had to do was to acquire it.It also made Jacob quite hopeful about collecting those magic cores.Now all was left to take this test, acquire those identity badges, and join those private star servers. As for what the end result will be, Jacob wasn't too worried about it.Even if the final result ends up with him not getting the Nightmare Magic Knight Rank, he would be glad since this would make all those unwanted attentions disappear, and no one will pay much attention to him anymore.Afterward, Jacob asked some common questions about the provinces and cities they were going to for this test, and Douglas answered as long as Jacob didn't stir up some sensitive topic.After twelve hours of driving and passing many plain fields and some small forest roads, they finally reached a place where Jacob saw more gas vehicles moving on a vast road that looked just like the modern civilization he remembered.Soon, they reached a check post where many troll soldiers were holding firearms.But seeing the military jeep, no one stopped in their tracks and let them pass when Douglas's flashed a badge on his star watch.After passing this check post, Jacob buildings, and some skyscrapers on the horizon, they reached the biggest city of East Golden Sword Province, Easter City!

Chapter 165 A Test?
﻿It was already starting to get dark when Jacob reached Easter City, which reminded him of a German City in the late 1900s.But the only difference was that it was already developed in technology as there were electric street lamps and road cars.It's just that Jacob wasn't used to seeing all those creatures and not humans driving and walking on these streets. He even felt somewhat sad for his own kind, but it was just a fleeting feeling.Suddenly Douglas remembered something as he revealed, "Oh, I almost forgot, Mr. Jack. Please give me your account number so I can send you your reward for bringing back the black ship and the bounty on Earth Slayer."As for the weapons in the black ship, we had already turned them into gold coins as well since you won't be needing those inferior goods."Jacob's eyes gleamed when he heard this. He also forgot about the promised reward Milan had told him about.'At least they knew how to keep others satisfied.' So Jacob thought before he told him his bank account number.Douglas then pressed on his star watch before transferring the amount to Jacob's account.When Jacob's star watch vibrated, he knew the transfer had been successful.He opened the star watch, and when he saw the message from the bank, his eyes widened ever so slightly.'Troll-Of-Just has transferred 1.5 billion gold coins into your personal bank account, no *****!'Another message soon followed,'Congratulation, your account balance had been crossed 1 Billion!'Your account no ****** is eligible for an upgrade to the B-Tier please visit our nearest branch to complete the process as soon as possible….'Jacob never expected the reward would be this huge for returning the black ship and killing a skull.However, if he knew the price of the black ship was 50 billion and it couldn't even be bought with the money, he won't think it was unreasonable at all.As for the Earth Slayer he killed, that guy had a bounty of 450 million, and the other hundred or so millions were for those weapons in the black ship.This was also a way to shock Jacob with just how generous the Golden Sword Country was, and it would only benefit him more if he stayed loyal.It might've worked on someone else, but it did not affect Jacob!"Thanks." Jacob still thanked the man and closed the star watch.Because of his purchase of the star information sea, he was running low on credit, so this amount just came in time.Douglas found Jacob's calm and unexcited reaction strange because anyone who becomes a billionaire out of the blue would have a much more intense reaction, especially if a person were like Jacob, a rustic.Yet, he reacted like a billion wasn't even a thing in Jacob's eyes, so Douglas thought that Jacob might not even know what a billion was, or he simply didn't care about money since he was from the wilderness and their money didn't matter.Afterward, they soon stopped in front of a grand building which named 'The Grand Holiday Inn.'"I guess Mr. Jack would be quite tired after our long journey. So we'll stay in this Inn, the best hotel in Easter City. I hope it will be up to your taste." Douglas chuckled as he exited the jeep.Jacob's eyes flashed mockingly before he exited the military jeep. He looked at the grand entrance where a goblin was standing as a bellboy and led them inside respectfully since Douglas was a Mountain Troll.Douglas booked two large rooms for themselves and handed a key to Jacob before saying, "Please head first, Mr. Jack. I'm going to meet a friend before I would join you for dinner."Jacob didn't care much and merely nodded before he was led by the goblin bellboy on the second floor where his room was stated.After Jacob reached the room, he asked the purple-skin goblin, "If the person with me came looking for me, tell him I'm retired for the night and don't want to be disturbed until morning.""Yes, my lord." The goblin quickly agreed respectfully.Jacob nodded and then tossed a gold coin toward the goblin. It was good that the currency was the same in the common and rare regions because of the Zodiac Taurus Bank, or it might pose a problem for Jacob to collect money from scratch again.His room was luxurious if he compared it to anything he had ever seen after coming into this world.But Jacob wasn't too concerned about the room. Instead, his eyes flashed in a peculiar glint as he thought, "Cursed Immortality!"The book appeared, hovering in front of him the next instant.Jacob coolly asked, "What is the strongest species around me right now?""What do you take me for? I'm your danger detector or something?" Immortika wrote in a perplexed tone as if it was annoyed for some reason."Just tell me if that Extraordinary Golden Elf is still around or not." Jacob was also annoyed.How could he not know about the Golden Elf haunting him like a pest?On that day, when Milan confronted him calmly and collectively, he instantly summoned Immortika and asked it to tell him what was the strongest species around him.When he discovered a hidden extraordinary-tier golden elf on the ship, he knew if he showed hostility, he would be dead!So, he pretended to play all along and as act if he didn't know anything.Although last night and in the morning when the meeting was held, the cooldown period of summoning was still not over, so he didn't know if there were someone there monitoring him.But he didn't dare to risk angering an extraordinary. He behaved as it was expected of him.When the cooldown period was finally over in the jeep, Jacob decided to save it until he reached the Easter City and then see if that golden elf was still following him or not."Only that Rare-Tier-8 Mountain Troll is hiding at the end of the corridor. What are you going to escape?" Immortika questioned with great interest.As long as Jacob's question was right, it would answer it, and gauging the tier of a species was something it had never rejected before, and this time wasn't any different.'That laying fucker.' Jacob's lips curled in a cold smile as he answered, "No, I'm not going to escape, and why should I?"They're still testing me, although I don't know what kind of range you had. I'm sure there would be an ambush waiting if I tried anything funny."I can even bet that this room is also being monitored right now, and it was all just a setup to see where's my loyalty lay and if I could be controlled or not."On the contrary, I'm going to be a loyal slave they all wanted me to be, and the moment I'm done with them, they look away… heh."Jacob sneered coldly before he moved toward his bedroom and did as he said he would and didn't try anything."Heheheh… interesting, interesting, this mind game of yours is to my liking. But what if they decided to send you on a suicide mission after not getting the result they want from that so-called magic test." Immortika questioned in excitement."I'll decide when the time comes. I just want to get into their information network for now, and the Nightmare Knight Legion will significantly help me."They clearly couldn't control the three hegemonies' actions, but for some reason, they could place those restrictions on their citizens to stop them from joining the three hegemonies without initiating their wrath."Something is going on here, and I need to find out what before I decide my next move. Unless…" Jacob's eyes turned sharp as he looked at the book meaningfully, "Unless you could help me spy on them or infiltrate their database so I could be on my way to collect those element cores." "Hahahah… it's still too soon for you to trick me into doing something like this, but nice try, though." Immortika instantly saw through Jacob's true intentions."Tsk, I was worth trying." Jacob snorted without being much shocked since he had expected this much and didn't pay much attention to the book anymore and lay down on the comfortable bed.Since those guys didn't intend to get rid of him as long as he behaved, he didn't have to worry about getting attacked for now.---Douglas, who had put an excuse to make Jacob show his true intentions, was still hiding inside the ceiling while coldly looking at the star watch in his hand.There was a live scene playing of Jacob lying on the bed!Suddenly a message popped up on the live feed,'Mightily_Sword: It seemed we were wrong about this little bumpkin's ambition. He's as obedient as a dog. Hehehe.'Douglas's eyes narrowed in uncertainty because he also thought that Jacob would escape the first chance he got, and this was just the chance he needed. He even gave him over a billion gold coins to make him reveal his fangs.Yet, here he was, sleeping, without even caring about being attacked, much less escaping!

Chapter 166 Nightmare Knight Legion (1)
﻿On his remaining day of stay, Jacob didn't tour the city, he only came out just for his meals, and even that was because Douglas invited him.Although this behavior raised some suspicion in Douglas's mind, but he couldn't just condemn the guy for his lack of interest. Nevertheless, Douglas never stopped monitoring, and people behind him were also on high alert.If Jacob had tried to escape or left a certain perimeter, it would've not ended well for him.The Easter City was highly guarded, and escaping it was night impossible with the City Magistrate present and on high alert.However, since Jacob didn't show any strange movement, nothing happened. Finally, the day arrived when he was again led in another black army jeet with a newcomer joining Jacob and Douglas.This person was another mountain troll named Nathanael, but he was slim, unlike Douglas. Yet, he gave Jacob a feeling of apprehension with that nasty smile on his face and the way he talked like he was a servant of people.However, Jacob could tell this person was dark from the inside, as if he was suppressing his true self, and Jacob knew too well about it."So, Mr. Jack, are you prepared?" Nathanael asked with a smile as he glanced at masked Jacob from the front seat mirror.According to Douglas, Nathanael was his friend in Easter City and also a Ranked Captain in the Golden Sword Army. He was here because he also had something to do in the Nightmare Knight Legion.Jacob impassively replied, "I'm always prepared.""Haha, that's the spirit, my foreign friend. We should always be prepared for the worse. That's the way of a warrior." Nathanael warmly stated."Indeed." Jacob plainly replied.Although he didn't know why this guy was with them, he didn't like him from the moment, he saw him and even wanted to kill him.Afterward, Nathanael didn't ask more questions since he could feel Jacob wasn't a chatterbox, and neither could he get something out of him. He was just too indifferent.Douglas was also having some misgivings about Jacob's actual personality now.They were headed toward one of the city's tallest skyscrapers in the center of Easter City.When they reached closer, it was a hundred-story black color building. It was structured like a broad sword, and a large golden emblem was in the center of this black building. It was a golden shield pierced by all sorts of cold weapons in black colors.It was the emblem of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, a shield that could remain intact after piercing by various weapons.But what astonished Jacob was the large black arena beside this building because it had huge crimson letters on top of it, 'Warrior Nightmare Arena' with the alliance emblem.When he saw Jacob looking at the black arena, Nathanael said, "It is one of the specialties of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, the Warrior Nightmare Arena, where anyone could fight and win unimaginable wealth."There is one arena in each province of our country located in the most prominent locations like the Easter City."Furthermore, the biggest attraction of the Warrior Nightmare Arena is the Death Match, where anyone can kill without being worried about the consequences!" He flashed a meaningful smile at Jacob at the end.Jacob merely glanced at Nathanael before he nodded without giving any reply.Everyone knew the Zodiac Warrior Alliance was a battle organization, and all their members were trained fighters. So, seeing the Warrior Nightmare Arena didn't give Jacob much shock.From ancient times, warriors liked to compete with each other to see who was the strongest and this arena just gave them a chance to find out while also winning wealth.Furthermore, conflicts between warriors were also quite normal, and sometimes death was the only solution.The Warrior Nightmare Arena was an excellent way to make it all legal so the others won't scheme against each other and drag others down.There was a large wall which was surrounding the whole Nightmare Knight Legion's territory, which one could only see when they were a few miles away.There were also large black gates with the shield emblem, made with a strange metal that could glow in the dark and glittered in the day.Right now, the gates were opened, and all kinds of people were going inside because today was the monthly entrance test of the Nightmare Knight Legion, and many wanted to become nightmare knights because they had too many perks!Unlike the Common Plains, there weren't any black knight academies in Rare Plains because there wasn't any need for them.Even though the population of common tier species was more significant than the rare tier species, they were far more powerful than those at the Common Plains because of the environmental difference.Although Jacob hadn't noticed it because of his powerful physique, but just the gravity in Rare Plains was five times heavier than the Common Plains!Furthermore, these four powers of the rare freedom plains were like the three kingdoms of the Uncommon Region.Anyhow, any means of transport wasn't allowed to enter inside, even the military. So, they had to park the jeep half a mile away in the underground parking lot.Afterward, they just walked like other people. Nathanael and Douglas weren't wearing any military uniform, so no one paid much attention to them.Jacob also observes the people around him; they all give off powerful feelings, and some are as strong as Douglas.According to Douglas, most of them were retaking the entrance test, making him wonder what could make a rare-tier-8 fighter fail a mere entrance test.However, what Douglas didn't reveal to Jacob was that the entrance test of the Nightmare Knight Legion wasn't just about physical strength; there were some other aspects involved.They just wanted to see if Jacob had magic potential or not and afterward pass the test on not all depends on Jacob.However, if he failed to pass the entrance test, he won't get another chance unless he became a level-2 citizen like these people around him.In fact, they hid more than half of the information from Jacob, which wasn't on the star information sea. So, Jacob had even less chance to come in contact with this information.But Jacob never believed in everything they said as well, he had asked Douglas if he was also a 1-Star Nightmare Knight, and his answer was simple, no.So, he had assumed that either Douglas wasn't interested or he didn't have the skills to pass the test both things had fifty/fifty chances.But now that he saw some fighters on the same level as Douglas, he knew it might be the latter case. As they entered the gate, they were blocked by a burly barbarian with a fierce face, an emblem of the alliance with one golden star attached to his chest armor. He also holds a black device in his hand.It was clear he was a 1-Star Nightmare Knight.He moved the black device in front of them and coldly said, "Registered your Star Network ID."Nathanael suddenly took out the same kind of emblem the Barbarian was wearing from his pocket and said with an amiable smile, "You look new, comrade, but only my little friend is here for the entrance test."The Barbarian was startled for a moment before he nodded, "You may go inside with one visitor.""All the best, we'll be rooting for you," said Nathanael encouragingly before he and Douglas left Jacob alone and walked toward the main building."Your Star Network ID." The Barbarian demanded coldly again.Jacob felt much better when he was alone, and just like others, he pressed his star watch on the device before that device scanned his star watch and his ID appeared on the device."Your exam type, Common or Rare?" He asked Jacob coldly.Since many people were here for just the Rank-1 to Rank-9 Nightmare Knight Exam, which was for common species, not for 1-Star Nightmare Knight Rank, which was specific for Rare Tier Species.However, others could still choose to either take a lower-rank test or jump to a higher rank. There wasn't any restriction by the alliance.But there was a significant difference; the Rare Entrance Test involved a Magic Talent Test!Jacob was astonished since no one told him about this choice, and he was only informed about taking the 1-Star Nightmare Knight Rank exam by Douglas.Despite his discontent, he still replied, "Rare."The Barbarian nodded and pressed on the rare type.The next moment, a black paper ticket with golden words was generated from the device, and the barbarian handed it to Jacob, "Alright, your participant number is 97. Head toward the Warrior Nightmare Arena. Your exam location is on Floor-2, Area, E-30. Just show them your participant ticket, and they'll guide you."Done saying he ignored Jacob and started registering other participants. There were tens of such people registering those who were here for entrance exams.It was done to make the registration process quicker and make the place less crowded.Furthermore, some of these people were here just to try their luck, so this first test was the fastest way to separate them from those with true potential!

Chapter 167 Nightmare Knight Legion (2)
﻿Jacob followed the other participants toward the Warrior Nightmare Arena.A fierce mountain troll was standing at the big entrance of the arena, holding a long blue spear, giving off an imposing aura."Those who were in the Common Type move left on the first floor, and those who are in the Rare Type move right toward the second floor!" He coldly stated.Jacob didn't react much and moved as he was told, and the large crowd turned into a small group when he moved toward the second floor. Because a Rare Type of exam wasn't a joke, and very few would take it every month, the passing rate was even more miserable!When everyone reached the second floor, it was pretty spacious, and there were nametags like the place where Jacob entered the second floor was Area, C-10, while his destination was Area, E-30."Keep moving until you find your allocated area. If someone were in the wrong area at the start, they would be deemed failed!" A cold voice resounded in the spacious hall, which was coming from a speaker!"Those with Arena below C move to the right pathway, and those above area C move to the left pathway." Another voice sounded at this moment.Afterward, Jacob didn't have to wander long and quickly found Area, E-30 after crossing Area D-20, which was actually just a spacious corridor, and some participants were gathering there.As Jacob approached that small group.An Orc who was standing in the Area, E-30, suddenly drew Jacob's attention. He was startled when he saw the appearance because it looked exactly like Pig Face except for its dark gray fur, and he was taller!Realization dawned upon him at this moment, and he finally understood Pig Face's background!'I still have that centipede in my pendant. Now that I'm in Rare Plains, I should find a way to use it and keep it under control.' Jacob suddenly thought of Eclipse Alipes Imhoff, aka Brain-Hunter.That Brain Hunter was clearly not something that could leave alone, so Jacob never tried to use it since he wasn't sure to control it, nor he knew how it was being controlled.So, he left it in the infinity pendant before finding a way to control it completely.Now that he saw that Pig Head Orc, he remembered again and started thinking about how to control it properly without being worried about it escaping his control.Nevertheless, Jacob decided to mull over it after he was done here.He found an empty corner and silently waited like others. No one was interested in talking with each other since they might turn into enemies in this test.---On the fifth floor of Nightmare Knight Legion's hundred-story building,At this moment, there were people coming entering this spacious room with a giant screen and rows of chairs in front of it.Douglas and Nathanael also appeared at this moment and picked a seat before sitting down without making a sound.Douglas spoke in a whispering voice, "What do you think about him (Jacob)?"Nathanael looked at the blank screen with an ambiguous smile, "He's indifferent but not a fool. This is all I can say for now."Let's watch his performance first. If he didn't have magic potential but became a 1-Star Nightmare Knight or not, then he'll be under me. It had already been decided. But I'll be out of here in disappointment if he had magic potential." He revealed smilingly.Douglas's reaction was calm as if he had already known, "But isn't it too early to send him into your unit? He still has to go past basic training before sending toward the wild nation, or we'll be just losing an asset because of our own vacuity!"Nathanael didn't retort and subtly replied, "If he became a 1-Star Nightmare Knight, then there's no need for the basic training. Trust me, this kind of person learns from the experience much more quickly. He's a wild breed. He had no place in the here but the battlefield."Douglas sneered at this moment, "You just want a new toy for yourself, and I'm quite surprised that they let you even have that guy despite knowing your previous conduct!"Nathanael didn't seem angry. Instead, his smile widened, which was no longer amiable but appalling!Douglas sensed a cold chill in his spine and shut his mouth, no longer speaking anymore.At this moment, the screen suddenly lit up as a cold voice sounded in the room."Dear observers, the Nightmare Knight Legion Entrance Test is about to begin, and to make it fair; we'll live broadcast it to our legion's members and their guests present!"---In the Area, E-30,The same voice sounded,Including Jacob, there were a total of 53 participants present in the Area, E-30."Dear participants, the test is about to start, and whoever will be appeared after this will be deemed failed even with a participant ticket without any exception!"The present participants, please enter the Arena-E where the Test of Potential will be conducted by the Test Inspector!"After this announcement, a door that led inside the arena-E suddenly opened, drawing everyone's attention.Without any fuss, they all entered one by one.When Jacob crossed the door, he appeared under a large doom, and there was a 100 square-meter transparent glass square in the center, which was clearly a fighting ring. Then there were empty spectator stands twenty meters away from this ring."Alright, everyone gathers around in two queues, on the right those who had taken this test before and the left newcomers!" A strong voice drew everyone's attention.A three-meter-tall Barbarian in silver armor and a broad sword sheathed on his back was standing on the left side on a small platform. He was also a 1-Star Nightmare Knight.Those participants followed his instruction and formed two queues while keeping a meter distance from each other.To Jacob's surprise, he was the only one in the left queue, which meant everyone was retaking this exam except him!Everyone stared at him like an anomaly at this moment.Even the Barbarian was looking at him with great interest.He spoke again, "My name is Jayceon, and I'll be your Inspector in this entrance exam. Since we have a newcomer, which is quite a rare sight around here, I'll have to explain the first test rules." Jayceon chuckled as he glanced at the masked Jacob, who looked emotionless.Some participants also grin as they look down on Jacob because he is a newcomer with no idea what he is getting into.Jayceon didn't delay and spoke, "The Test of Potential is as simple as it could get, as everyone could see this crystal ball behind me...""You're in the way. We can't see it!" Someone snickered in the crowd."Oh." Jayceon quickly reacted and instantly sidestepped, revealing a one-meter-long pillar. On this pillar was a white crystal ball that was four feet in diameter. Jayceon continued with his explanation, "Ahem, so as everyone can see, this is a Magic Detection Crystal, and if anyone had magic potential, it would glow, and that person may directly pass this exam and become a Nightmare Magic Knight."Since the lot of you are repeating this test, then this means you have no magic potential, so we should've moved to the second test. However," His eyes landed on Jacob and smiled, "However, since we have a newcomer, the test of potential had to proceed."Alright, newbie, give me your participant ticket, place your hands on this crystal, and then pray that it lit up."However, no one laughed because they all knew how it felt when that damn crystal lay dormant and crushed their dreams of coming in contact with fabled Magic.They all thought this newbie would suffer the same thing because magic knights were just too rare, and those races with such potential were all in the central provinces.Jacob's eyes also shimmered with anticipation because Magic was something he wanted the most after Immortality. After all, it simply meant unimaginable power and possibilities.So, he moved toward the platform, handed his ticket to Jayceon, and then moved toward the white crystal.Even those in spectator rooms were closely watching since Jacob's figure was showing on the screens right now.Under everyone's sharp eyes, Jacob took a deep breath before placing his hands on the crystal.Everyone intensely stared at the white crystal, with complete silence. Even Jayceon's playful expression had changed into a solemn one.However, when a full minute passed, and there was still no light, everyone sighed because this meant this newbie also didn't have any affinity with Magic, and he was now probably so depressed that he won't be able to move for a long time.Yet, Jacob simply removed his hands and chuckled, "As expected."He then looked at Jayceon and asked, "What now?"Jayceon felt like something was wrong with this guy's head, or he simply didn't know what kind of opportunity he had missed, and he would be mediocre his whole life.However, right at this moment, everyone's eyes suddenly went wide as they looked behind Jacob!

Chapter 168 Nightmare Knight Legion (3)
﻿Jacob's eyes narrowed when he saw everyone'd startled expression, including Jayceon, and he twisted around toward the magic detection crystal. What he saw made even him shocked!Surprisingly, the white crystal was begun to crack, and they were spreading on the crystal-like spider web.Thereby, the crystal suddenly burst like glass thrown to the wall, falling on the floor in pieces.Jayceon eyes were narrowed into slides because he had no idea what happened himself since the magic detection crystal was never broken in the history of the potential test.The spectators were also bewildered because the crystal didn't glow but broke and they were as confused as anyone watching right now.Jayceon finally looked at Jacob and sternly said, "What is your kind? Lose that mask right now!"Jacob felt a bad feeling from Jayceon at this moment, completely different from his jolly -self earlier. But he also wanted to know what this phenomenon meant, so he summoned Cursed Immortally instantly.As well as he replied to Jayceon since he didn't want any misunderstanding in the middle of the legion's headquarters!"I'm only here to take the test because I was told. I'm new in these lands and have no idea what all this means." Jacob stated while he took off his mask, revealing his still scared face, which looked hideous.While he asked Immortika in his mind coldly, "What just happened?"Although Jacob wanted to find Magic within, he wasn't optimistic about it since this crystal might not work on him, like so many other species.However, this situation where this anomaly appeared was the last thing he wanted when he was right in the middle of the wolf's den!Now he could only cooperate as much as he could and hope that whatever it was not put him into some dangerous situation.Jayceon eyes narrowed when he heard Jacob's explanation, and on his face, he could clearly tell Jacob wasn't lying and even cooperating without raising any fuss.Immortika also replied to Jacob's question, which was actually wasn't much of a reply and more of a sarcasm."Hahahah… it's not my fault that flawed glass shattered, right?"Jacob cursed inwardly when he saw this note, and he knew this was really going to be a pain in the rear."How many strong species than me or on my level are around me?" He changed the question."Enough to keep you company unless you died of exhaustion, hahahaha…."Jacob grimaced when he read that, so he gave up on the plan of escaping if things went awry.At this moment, the same cold voice rang from the speaker again, "Participant Number 97, please head toward the meeting area!"Jayceon's lips curled when he heard this, and he handed Jacob his participant ticket and pointed toward the metal door on the left side."Go. I think you might get the opportunity of life." He told meaningfully.However, Jacob would never believe it. Yet, he still moved since he didn't have a choice, but in his heart, he had already decided to vanish at the first chance he got.Even if this incident doesn't raise any red flags, it was enough reason for Jacob not to be able to relax completely.Under everyone's eyes, he entered the bright passage behind the door.He also wore his mask and kept Immortika open.Soon, he reached a cross pathway.At this moment, he heard light steps from one of the pathways, and soon he saw a tall, slim figure approaching. She was another barbarian, wearing sink-tight white body armor, raveling her curves and big chest. She was like a wild beauty with sharp blue eyes filled with a fiery glint.She coldly looked at Jacob and said, "Follow me." She then turned around and walked away without caring about Jacob.Jacob also wasn't in the mood for a chat and followed silently.To Jacob's surprise, they cross another corridor before they exit the arena from a door, and in front of them is a bridge connected with the main building."Where are we going?" He finally asked as they walked on the bright, which was connected with the second floor."To meet the Nightmare Knight Commander!" She coldly replied without hiding it.'This is really not a simple matter.' Jacob was gloomy because he knew the Knight Commander was actually like the Guild Master or Branch Manager of the Nightmare Knight Legion.However, Nightmare Knight Commanders were only appointed in branches like Easter City, which had a Nightmare Warrior Arena with it, and other branches were controlled by Nightmare Knight Vice-Commanders.It was because any Nightmare Knight Commander had at least a 2-Star Strength!So being called by the Nightmare Knight Commander of the Easter City was really a big deal, and Jacob didn't even know how this meeting would bode for him.Soon, they entered the main building, and Jacob was greeted by the sight of a closed door and a birdcage elevator.She moved toward the elevator without any hesitation and looked at Jacob before saying in disdain, "This is an Elevator, don't freak out. Just stand your ground, and it'll be fine."Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he heard it, 'She's thinking I don't know what an elevator is? This piece of old junk is not something that could make me shocked.'He sneered inwardly but didn't reveal his thoughts and obediently stood beside her.Jacob could guess even these elevators were luxury in rare plains, so anyone who had seen them first would be shocked and marvel at them.The barbarian woman locked the gate and then put a metal key into the keyhole in the button panel, and after twisting it around, she pressed the bronze button with the number 100 on it, and it brightened up as the lift started to rose.However, when he looked at Jacob to see his marvelous expression, she was disappointed as he remained static without showing any hint of surprise.'Hmph, pretending to be cool.' She thought disdainfully before stopping paying attention."It seemed things were moving quite 'smoothly,' huh? Hahaha…"Jacob read that line in the book with exasperation. He knew this damn book was just enjoying his misery while knowing precisely what was happening."You're sure you don't want to give me any hint, or I might die today, or even worse, they might turn me into a test subject. At that time, you might not be able to enjoy yourself anymore." Jacob tried to trick the book for some hint about this situation.However, he was destined to be disappointed."Whatever, I couldn't help you no matter what, even without any restriction. I'm just a book, not a weapon. Violence is not my forte. So you're on your own.""Don't make me laugh by saying, 'Violence is not your forte.' You're probably made for violence!" Jacob coldly refuted in his mind."OH? You found out, but how? Hahahaha…"Jacob ignored the hateful book. If not for because he needed it to detect strong species around, he would've already made it disappear.The elevator was relatively slow, and it took over five minutes to reach the 100th floor.When they both stepped outside, there was a spacious, long hall with ten doors on each side, while only a single pair of doors was currently opened at the end of this hall.There were also two more birdcage elevators in the center of this hall.The barbarian woman led Jacob toward those open doors, and he followed.When they entered the room, Jacob's eyes narrowed because he saw two familiar faces sitting on chairs around a rectangular table. They were Douglas and Nathanael!Finally, a muscular person was sitting in front of these two, his skin was filled with small diamond shape blue scales, and there were two small purple mounds below his snake-like cold eyes.Immortika revealed the detail about this person at this moment, "He is an Extraordinary-Tier-1 Purple Poison Snake Man, one of the demi-humans. Quite a rare breed between a Snake Men Race. He also had Intermediate level 4-Star Poison Element Core! Tsk, tsk, useless to you, I guess, still deadly, though!"Jacob's heart turned cold as he didn't dare to mess around with such a person, so he remained quiet and decided to see why he was summoned here.The barbarian woman respectfully speaks to the Snake Man at this moment, "This is the person you requested for Commander!"This Snake Man was none other than the Nightmare Knight Commander, Nixon!Nixon coldly looked at Jacob with his snake eyes, and suddenly his pale lips curled upward, "Thank you, Ally, please give us the room. Mr. Jack, please have a seat."Ally didn't question and left before closing the doors.Jacob suddenly noticed Douglas and Nathanael's expressions at this moment, and they were somewhat cold and… ugly!Nixon spoke in a friendly tone, "Let me officially introduce myself, my name is Nixon, and I'm the current Knight Commander of Easter City's branch. Mr. Jack, I already know about you from Secretary Douglas."As for why you were called here after that strange incident in the arena, I'll explain everything but first…." He looked at Jacob meaningfully and questioned smilingly, "Do you want to join Nightmare Knight Legion… permanently!"

Chapter 169 A Blanker?
﻿"…Do you want to join Nightmare Knight Legion… permanently!"Jacob was startled by this sudden unexpected question from Nixon.Douglas suddenly slammed his hand on the table at this moment as he coldly uttered, "Commander Nixon, you're going too far!"Nathanael also had an ugly expression since Nixon was poaching their men right in front of them. He clearly was talking them for wind and didn't give the Golden Swords Country face!Nixon was a Demi-human, and Demi-Human didn't live in Golden Swords Country, but in the Ice Nation, so he wasn't the person of Golden Swords Country.The top positions of the three hegemonies were all occupied by the personnel of the different nations so that they won't be biased toward their homeland and make decisions in favor of the three hegemonies.It was done deliberately, and it worked like a charm!That was why these four powers couldn't control or force those high-level members of the three hegemonies to do anything which implicated the three hegemonies.This was the same case for Nixon. The Nightmare Knight Legion appointed him in the Golden Swords Country from the Ice Nation, and he did not belong to them, nor was he afraid of offending them.Because offending him would mean offending the entire Nightmare Knight Legion of Rare Freedom Plains and Golden Swords Country would never take this suicidal path or any other power, as a matter of fact.Although the three hegemonies allowed the four powers of Rare Freedom Plains to make all those laws and let them control their members, it didn't mean they were their thralls!This was the same case when it came to poaching members from the four powers into their own ranks as long as they were talented enough.But it seldom happened, and they never forced those people to join them. It was entirely the other party's choice.Those who were loyal to their nations would never accept these kinds of offers to break free from their roots, and only those ungrateful ones jumped the ships.But so, what? Those four powers could only watch helplessly and kept their resentment to themselves and hated that person. They couldn't afford to fight with them or harm that person openly.However, whoever got these offers were all highly talented individuals. And if they decided to choose this path of separating themselves, they were all sore to the sky, and those powers behind them couldn't do anything about it.Nixon was such a person and had no loyalty toward his own nation or any power. He was loyal to the Nightmare Knight Legion only and always made decisions for their benefit.That's also what is happening right now!Nathanael and Douglas knew about it when they saw Jacob breaking the crystal, so they rushed here to see whether or not Nixon was trying to poach Jacob from them.But they never expected he had already summoned Jacob before they even reached here, and they were just trying to make him understand that Jacob was an important asset of their country and hope he could give their country a face this time.However, when they heard footsteps, they knew this guy wasn't going to sway by their bribes, and it became even more apparent when he invited Jacob right in front of them.So, Douglass naturally couldn't take it sitting, and he also wanted to show Jacob that they weren't weaker and timed in front of three hegemonies.Nixon coldly smiled as he looked at Douglas with a frosty expression, "Do you want to interfere when I'm inviting someone? Do you forget where you are and who the fuck your true owner is?! I dare you to utter another word right here and right now and prove that you are not our servants!"Jacob was astounded by this guy's overbearing attitude and the ghastly pressure he had just released, which made even him flinch. He suddenly felt like he was in the presence of a cold predator without any chance of escaping!One could only imagine those two who this strange pressure was locked on to would be feeling right now.Douglas and Nathanael couldn't even breathe as their expression turned pale, sweat beaded on their foreheads as he looked at those snake eyes staring at them like they were prey.Nathanael quickly spoke in a hoarse voice, "C-commander, please… forgive us. We went too far."Douglas couldn't even breathe, much less speak, but anyone could tell from his pale face that he was suffocating and wanted to make it stop."Hmph, good dog! Now fuck off and wait outside. You don't deserve to be in the presence of your master!" Nixon menacingly sneered without hiding his contempt anymore while retracting that pressure.Those two felt like they had just escaped death and quickly stood up and left, but both gave Jacob a sharp, meaningful look before they exited the room.Jacob acted as if he didn't see them, as he was mulling over what he had just heard and saw, 'This might not be a bad thing after all.' He thought.Nixon finally looked at Jacob, which made the latter flinch and smile amiably, "Please forgive my conduct just now, but they don't know their places, and sometimes it became important to teach others their places. Please sit."Jacob looked meaningfully at Nixon before nodding and walking toward the empty sits, he didn't feel any hostility from him, and it was pretty clear this guy favored him for some reason."Let's continue where we were interrupted," Nixon stated with a meaningful smile."First, can you tell me what joining you permanently means and why I was selected?" Jacob questioned with uncertainty.Nixon plainly shook his head, "I can't tell you unless you join. It's a core secret only permanent members should know. Albeit we won't force you, and it's your choice entirely."All I can tell you is that if you didn't choose, you would still be given a 1-Star Nightmare Knight Rank its perks. But you will also be taken into the core of the Golden Swords Country after this."Although they will pour resources on you like mad, but they will also make sure to own you fully before letting you out, which they will hide behind their honey-courted words."While here, you will still be free but no longer the member of any four powers or the other two hegemonies. You could join the other two hegemonies' ranks but can't be their permanent member."You could see it like a permanent nationality of sorts."Jacob was intrigued by this sublet reply, and he got some idea about what this 'Permanent Member' was about."Will I be restricted by some other rules like those countries?" He asked."No, those fools just make those rules for their own benefits, you would be restriction-free but just bond by our laws which are quite lax as long as you won't betray us," Nixon replied.He had already gotten the information on Jacob from those two, and he knew this guy had about a 90% chance of agreeing to their offer since he had no belonging to any power. Jacob still didn't agree too quickly, "At least tell me why that crystal was broken, and I'll give my exact answer."Nixon suddenly smiled as he looked at Jacob in light, 'He's too cautious. We need someone like him in freedom plains!'So, he decided to reveal it as he had a good impression of Jacob since he didn't blind by the benefits in front of him."It was broken because you didn't have magic, but you're on the verge of awakening it. This kind of phenomenon appeared one in a million, and we called these people Blankers."A Blanker is someone who had a 99% chance of awakening magic potential, and the most fantastic thing about a Blanker is that they are like a blank paper that could be colored in any color."Simply put, exposure to rare elements could make a Blanker awake that element!"Realization dawned upon Jacob at this moment. This was simply too ridiculous."Is this true?" He quickly questioned Immortika, who was still hovering in front of him."Hahaha, they're simply taking you for something entirely different. The concept he just mentioned is relatively easy to create as long as you have the proper knowledge, and this way, you could change someone's yet to awake element into a different element, but there's a limit to it."It can also develop naturally, and those guys indeed have a chance to awake some rare element, but it's not a big deal as this guy is making it. All they are just lucky little ants, nothing worth mentioning."But I guess it is normal for these inferior beings to have no idea about it, and they took it as a miracle. Anyway, all you need to know is you are not this Blanker thing!"Although he got an answer this time, it left a bad taste in his mouth for some reason.Since it wasn't the case for him, then didn't this mean he was even more worthless than ants?Nevertheless, he had a more pressing matter to deal with. He looked at Nixon, since this guy was taking him for a Blanker, it was a good thing for Jacob!

Chapter 170 Permanent Member!
﻿Jacob nodded, "Alright, I'll join as a permanent member."This decision was quite obvious, especially after he saw the difference in status between the four power of freedman plains and the three hegemonies.Furthermore, he had already seen through the controlling nature of Golden Swords Contrary.He knew what Nixon said about if he went with them, he might not get out, and he believed they might even use something like a parasite gem to control a 'Blanker' like him.On the contrary, the Nightmare Knight Legion had the strongest Zodiac Warrior Alliance behind them and didn't need to beg or control a mere blanker.It was just an opportunity presented by them, and if someone didn't want to, they could simply reject it.Lastly, Jacob didn't have time to play around with Golden Swords Country. He wanted to start his hunt for those magic cores, and he knew the information network of the Nightmare Knight Legion would be a massive help to him.As for Nightmare Knight Legion's laws, they won't be as petty as the four powers. Nixon smiled winded when he heard Jacob's reply and said, "You won't regret this choice! Let me get rid of those fleas now, and they won't pester you anymore."Nixon smiled coldly before sending Ally a message through his Star Watch to get rid of those two outside for good.Since Jacob had decided to become a permanent member, he was no longer in the jurisdiction of four powers anymore.Although it will make the Golden Swords Country indignant, so what? Could they come here and demand an explanation? Absolutely not!Since the three hegemonies let them put all those laws, they also expected them to back down when they broke those laws every now and then. It was much better than ending those laws for good.After sending the message, Nixon opened a compartment of his desk, took out a one-square-meter scanner, and put it on the table in front of Jacob."Alright, you just have to register as a permanent member before I explain it to you," Nixon stated before he placed his hand on the black screen.Thereby, a red scanning line started to scan his hand, which only had four knives-like sharp fingers filled with scales.Words appeared on the screen after the scanning was successful.'Registration for Membership in Zodiac Warrior Alliance.'Nixon pressed it without any hesitation, and another scanning screen appeared.He looked at Jacob and ordered, "Place both your hands on it."Jacob thought for a moment before he placed his hands on the device before scanning started, and a static voice suddenly began to ring."Life Signal test pass!"Species classified as 'Unknown' in the Rare Plains database."Species Rank is 'Unknown'"DNA scanning start…"DNA is not registered in the database. A new member has been detected!"Searching for Star Network ID and other information…"ID detected, 'Faceless Ancient…"Bank Account Detected……Jacob was astonished when he heard information on his species, and when he saw Nixon's eyes narrow, he knew this guy was as surprised as him.'How did my species turn into 'Unknown,' or did they simply didn't have any information on humans?' Jacob frowned slightly because having an unknown species meant he was unique, and this might draw some unwanted attention if news got out."So, you really are from the star ocean," Nixon commented meaningfully.Before, he didn't believe that Jacob had come from some random island but now that even their database didn't have Jacob's species, it meant he might really be from a faraway place.This was a rare case since no new species like Jacob had appeared in the rare plains for hundreds of years. It was even bigger news than a blanker appearing in rare freedom plain.Furthermore, Jacob also had magic potential, which might cause some inconvenience for Jacob if those races with magic potential found him an eyesore.However, it would only happen if Nixon leaked this information."I already told you guys, but no one seemed to believe me." Jacob merely shrugged his shoulder as if he had no idea what it meant to be a new species."Scanning has been completed!"Faceless Ancient, you have been registered as a Member of the Zodiac Warrior Alliance."You have been appointed as Reserve Zodiac Warrior."Your Rare Plain Rank is 1-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight."Confidential Information about Membership has been sent to your star watch account. Please don't share it with anyone!""Reserve Zodiac Warrior and Nightmare Warrior Knight?" Jacob was startled when he heard these unfamiliar terms.His Star Watch also lit up at this moment as message after message started to appear from the 'Zodiac Warrior Alliance,' and there were five messages.Nixon spoke as he put the device away at this moment, "Congratulations, you're now a true member of Zodiac Warrior Alliance, not a branch member!"Jacob looked at Nixon with uncertainty. He wanted an explanation.As he revealed, Nixon didn't hide it anymore, "Although you already got the information about the membership in your Star Watch, I'll still explain some basic information."As you know, the three hegemonies had branches all over the plains. Those members who joined those branches are actually branch members."The Permanent Members are those who truly joined the main power behind those branches. We also called ourselves Permanent Members to not reveal the true meaning behind Permanent Members to the public or those four powers. They only thought that permanent members had joined our branches permanently, but it's not the case!"The ranks applied to the Permanent Members are also different from the branch members as they were given the proper ranks of the leading power."Our Zodiac Warrior Alliance Ranks started from the Reserve Ranks like the Legion and then Rank-1 to Rank-9 before the Star Ranks. However, the threshold for those ranks is not something we could imagine."You can say they are investing in us because we had the potential to evolve into those ranks!"Jacob's eyes shimmered with understanding, "So, you're saying if we could cross a certain threshold, they can help us leave the rare plains?"He wasn't a fool and instantly caught the true meaning behind Nixon's explanation.Nixon smiled with a hint of excitement, "Exactly! Although the Rare Plains are enormous and still unexplored, it doesn't mean there is nothing above them. It is just that we are too weak to explore that place."You could say the three hegemonies are omnipotent-like existences, and they were here to help those who were worthy of their help. But those four powers didn't know about this truth because they simply didn't need to know."As for the 1-Star Nightmare Warrior Rank, it was rank for us Rare Plains Natives and wasn't any different from a fighter or magic knight."As long as we cross all Nine Nightmare Warrior Star Ranks, we can become a Rank-1 Zodiac Warrior, and that is the threshold to leave the Rare Plains!" Nixon's voice was full of yearning as he said it.Realization dawned on Jacob at this moment, 'So the three hegemonies are here to found those people who could cross extraordinary rank? Just what is the rank above it!'He was quite curious about it since this rank could make those three hegemonies go through all this trouble just for the possibility that such a person might appear.Nixon then looked meaningfully at Jacob, "And don't even think for a second that anyone could obtain a permanent member slot. Even magic knights might not be able to catch our Commanders' eyes."We, the Knight Commanders, only got ten slots every twenty years, so you could imagine just how precious these slots are."I invited you because you are a blanker, which means you have the potential to evolve. In the history of rare freedom plains, only a single person had ever managed to cross the rare plains from our alliance, and he happened to be a blanker!""You're expecting too much from me." Jacob calmly stated, but he was still not convinced that it was only why Nixon gave him a spot.Nevertheless, he won't make it look like he was ungrateful and let Nixon think he was in debt."I know. I'm willing to take this chance." Nixon smiled amiably, "Don't worry about anything while you're here. You were given a personal training room on the hundred floors, as you may have seen those ten doors."Eight of them had already been occupied by excellent members of our branch. More importantly, you couldn't reveal that you are a permeant member to anyone. It's in your contract sent to you by headquarters. You can read it later."There are also perks to being a permanent member, you'll know once you open those messages, and if you have any questions or want to leave for a mission, you could find me first." Nixon seriously expressed the last part.Jacob nodded in agreement, and then Nixon told him some more critical things to Jacob before he was given a key to his training room!
