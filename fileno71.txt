Chapter 71 Visitors Again?!
﻿Austin left Jacob's house with a slightly regretful expression.He looked at Jacob's stoic face and sincerely said, "Please consider it carefully. I'll be staying here for some days, if you have any questions, you can find me in the lord's manor anytime."Jacob merely nodded before he closed the door.Kai couldn't help but utter in an unhappy tone, "How rude! Teacher, why did you give him so much face while he doesn't put you in his eye?"Austin walked toward the exit and said faintly, "He's worthy of this respect. If he can give up his pride this time, I think you two might meet soon in the examination."Kai's expression changed as he questioned, "Don't tell me…""Yes, I invited him. But he's too sharp for his own good. Let's see what happened. I tried my best in the end." Austin sighed and didn't continue the topic anymore.Kai also remained silent but deep within his eyes, a killing intent flashed!Harland had no idea what they were talking about, but he knew he won't be able to present the gifts after he saw Jacob closing the door at Austin.---Jacob returned after making sure those three left the vicinity of his house.He couldn't help but sneered, "That old goat wanted to trick me into taking this black knight academy's test, and then I would be forever tied by the Humane Kingdom if I can't achieve a B rank or pass the test in the rare region. "I bet that Marshal fellow is at the bottom of this organization and probably exhausted his talent and send back to promote the organization. Who wouldn't want to be like him if they were normal?"But that Marshal is just a pretty display here in the uncommon region, while he didn't mean shit in the rare region. Heh, trying to play with this old man? You're a life early, humph!"Jacob was extremely displeased in the end, the slightly good feeling he had toward Austin completely vanished.He wasn't a fool, and he knew these things very well. An organization that allowed others to take from it, will always take back and much more than the others took from it.This was like a slave contract. Once you sign, no matter what you do in your life, you can never escape from it. The others will find a way to exploit it and you will fall deeper and deeper into that endless hole until you died.Jacob was just too familiar with this process.This Zodiac Worrier Alliance was doing just that. Although they gave the methods to become strong, they took away your freedom.Furthermore, their way of doing it was quite meticulous because they won't directly enslave anyone to them but instead they let them serve in their homes, which no one felt uncomfortable with or thought of rebelling.The nations would also be pleased with this setting because they were getting the trained soldiers by the Zodiac Worrier Alliance and they would even promote it with everything they had.However, Jacob knew if this alliance ever felt threatened by a big enemy, these prideful discarded fools would be the first ones to summon back and become the cannon folds.At that time, those nations won't have the guts to reject them nor those fools will dare to raise any objection since in their mind they were being rewarded by summoning back.'Heh, they're using the way of creating longing and then giving back with more longing.' Jacob smiled disdainfully.Even if he was desperate enough to join such an organization in the future, he would make sure to leave a way out.Because he didn't want to have such a big enemy on his tail unless he didn't have reason to, and besides, he knew eventually he won't be afraid of these hegemonies.But as long as he can remain neutral, he doesn't take the path of war and avoid it, if he could.That was why he asked Austin to leave rudely, since it won't create much hope in the old man's mind, nor would he feel resentful toward Jacob because he knew the pros and cons himself.Throwing the matter with Austin's back of his head, he started the last distillation process again.It was already late at night when Jacob was done with brewing and injecting.He didn't fatigue at all, but he felt the hunger that was increasing with each injection and he was planning to head to the wildness again as soon as he got the titan iron swords.But the peace didn't last long, as he welcome another visitor the next morning.This time, there were two, and Jacob was even slightly familiar with one of them.It was none other than the vice leader of the rain town mercenary agency, Ralf.With Ralf was another middle-aged man with short pepper salt hair, average height, and tone build.The man introduces himself with a polite smile, "I'm the Leader of Star Mercenary Agency in Rain Town, Warren!"However, to both men's surprise, Jacob didn't even invite them in and asked in a vexed tone, "What do you both want? I'm telling you, I won't join anyone, no matter what you offer me."Warren glanced at Ralf with a questionable gaze, and Ralf shrugged. He meant he had no idea why this fellow was like this.Although Ralf had a brief encounter with Jacob, he still didn't know his personality. He had already invited Jacob to meet with Warren, but he never appeared and instead vanished for over a month.It was yesterday they received news of his return and thought he would visit them since they consider it beneath them to visit Jacob with their status.But when they heard, Austin had paid Jacob's a visit with the man's own mouth before coming to them.They suddenly felt something was amiss and came here first thing in the morning.But Jacob was just cold and without any manner, he didn't give them any face at all, despite their introduction.This made them slightly unhappy, especially Warren, who had a bad temper!

Chapter 72 Scaring Away Visitors!
﻿Despite his displeasure, Warren didn't rebuke and pull a smile and said, "I learn you joined when I was out of town, which was quite unfortunate. However, Vice Leader Ralf invited you for a visit but you never came. So, I came personally to satisfy my curiosity."Jacob impassively replied, "Are you satisfied now?"Ralf's expression turned unkind at this moment as he sternly said, "Kid, don't push your luck anymore. We are here with good inten…"Before he could finish his word, a blur flashed before Ralf's eyes, and the next moment he suddenly felt the powerful claw on his mouth which was clenching his entire jaw, almost to the point of breaking it.Ralf tried to struggle but no matter what he couldn't get free from Jacob's claw on his mouth, fear creeped out in his eyes.'Moooo…'Warren's heart palpitated as he looked at Jacob, who had a cold smirk on his face while he held Ralf like he was a helpless rabbit. He didn't even see when Jacob moved and he finally understood they were barking up the wrong tree this time. Truth be told, these two were like gangsters of this town, they collect monthly free from every mercenary who stayed in the rain town and the lord's mansion.They both used their positions to take advantage of the powerless since they knew as long as they won't offend anyone with a higher status, they won't get in trouble.The agency would protect them from minor charters like the Town Lord as long as won't go too far.Even Jonty had to pay them if he wanted to stay here!They have been doing this for years now, and never suffer any backlash… well, until today.When they found out Austin has met with Jacob, they thought he was moving away from here and wanted to test the water.If it was true, they won't interfere or show their true colors, but if it was just their speculation, then they would demand the monthly fee from him.However, they never thought Jacob was strong to the point that he could make Ralf immobilized like a chicken.Now, Warren perspired as he looked at Ralf, who was struggling while glancing at him with his bloodshot eyes, asking for help.Jacob coolly looked at Warren and coldly uttered, "Listen carefully. I'm saying it one last time if you two eyesores appeared anywhere near my sight. I'll skin you alive right in the middle of the town. Is that clear?"Warren couldn't help but took a step back as his back was filled with cold sweat and eyes with fear.He replied in a hoarse voice, "I-I… We understand!"Jacob nodded in satisfaction, as he waved his other hand and toss Ralf like a rag doll.Warren's eyes nearly popped up from their place when he saw Raft was literally flying out of the fence!Warren suddenly felt like slapping Ralf silly since he didn't even recognize this monster in human skin and nearly bring them to the death door!Jacob looked at Warren, which made him flattered, "Fuck off and announce this as well. If anyone had some business with me, they can send written letters. If they dare to knock on my door and disturb me anymore…" He smiled viciously, "Heh, I'll find you."Warren hurriedly nodded before he fled without caring about Ralf, who lay in the middle of the road, listlessly.Jacob closed the door again and shake his head in frustration. 'This should put an end to those scheming idiots' visits.'Afterward, no more visitors appeared, which made Jacob content mentally, yet he was restless physically because of that creeping hunger. He had already eaten everything in the house, but he just couldn't get satisfied.This made him even more eager to start this hunting season because he could get uncommon animals' meat in the wild, which was far more nutritious than these common animals.Even if he failed in finding the tiger bull, he can still slowly quench that hunger with uncommon animals out there.When the first ray of light shone on the rain town, Jacob exited his house and directly head toward the smithery.Isaac was waiting for Jacob when he appeared and handed him two sheathed, curved, short swords.Jacob grab those dark hilts and draw those fourteen inches swords, and thin dark blades appeared giving of cold dark sheen.He looked at Isaac and nodded. "Thanks, they should be enough for now."Isaac smiled in satisfaction. "Those short swords should be able to cut rocks like butter, without leaving a scratch on the blades. I should be the one thanking you for giving me the chance to work with titian iron."Jacob replied as he attached those scabbards to his belt. "I might be gone for a while now if I didn't find what I'm looking for, so keep my things safe."Isaac nodded and assured, "Don't worry, I had a safe place."Jacob merely nod and left.He headed straight toward the town gate and left toward the direction where the tiger bull left some trails when it ran away.Jacob was pretty sure that bull wasn't something that will remain low-key, especially not in this place where it was the strongest.Most importantly, Jacob didn't want someone else to spot it and alert some annoying people, or worst, that hidden force might've already been looking for it after they found out about the incident with the tiger bull delivery.It was pretty easy to guess since the tiger bull was supposed to be appeared in the lionheart city by now, but it doesn't so someone might investigate the reason behind it.Nevertheless, if they came in his way to get that bull, they will be courting death!---On the eastern part of Rainy Mountain Ranges,A man with deep wounds on his face and chest was running madly toward the exit of the valley with an aghast face.His mind was filled with deep dismay, and fear as he ran.'How could such a creature have appeared in this region? My entire crew was wiped out and if I hadn't escaped in time, I would've been like them as well. Only B-rank mercenaries might deal with it. But that might be too late since it's heading toward the humane kingdom. I have to hurry!'

Chapter 73 Finding The Bull
﻿Jacob has been on the bull hunt for over two weeks now, but he had no luck.However, it doesn't mean he hasn't hunted any prey in these fourteen days. He had already collected two uncommon hearts and eaten many uncommon animals of the same species.But he could feel the progress was quite slow, and he probably reached 15% compatibility with his heart yet.Nevertheless, his hunger wasn't increasing, so this was a plus and he mused this way he might reach a 100% compatible rate with his heart in three or four months.Three more days pass and Jacob was going deeper within the rainy mountains where uncommon animals were abundant. But he still has found no trace of that bull or they were all washed away because of the rain.But it matters not to him as he continues forward.However, on this particular day, Jacob's ears perked when he noticed footsteps that didn't belong to animals, and he could tell they were coming from someone on two feet.He quickly jumped on a tree and hide.Thereupon, a man appeared in an extremely sorry state.Jacob noticed the wood on his left shoulder, which was like he was stabled by a thick drill! 'The bullhorns!' He quickly thought of those massive bullhorns and he felt excited.However, before he could act, his expression changed slightly and he remained static in his position.Thereupon, three clocked figures appeared before that wounded man. They were extremely quick. Even Jacob only noticed them when they were ten meters away from this place.That wounded man was started, but when that man saw they were not wild animals, he nearly cried in joy and relief.The next moment, his eyes roll upward as he lost consciousness.One of the cloaked figures spoke. "It seemed he's extremely exhausted, so the moment he saw us that exhaustion washed over him, and now we can't question him."Another voice feminine voice rang, "Heh, we don't need him anyway, right Captain?"The cloaked figure, who was two-meter-tall, spoke in a deep voice, "No, we need to know how that bull escaped, or this person was with the group who interfere with the cargo and then failed to keep it. Most importantly, we need to know if someone has the letter! Awake him."The female nodded, "I was waiting for you to say it." there was a hint of wicked elation in her voice.Suddenly, a handgun appeared in her hand. She pointed it toward the unconscious man's crotch and pull the trigger!'Bang!'Just as the gunshot voice rang, the unconscious man's eyes sprang open, filled with extreme agony as his screams filled the area!The captain crouched in front of that man's agonized face and coldly said, "If you want the pain to go away, tell me where do you get that wound?"The man seemed to not hear him at all.The other man said at this moment, "He's in hyperbolic shock. I don't think he can talk."The captain waited for a moment before his hand suddenly blurred and he stood up.But the man has stopped screaming, and there was a finger hole in the man's forehead right now. A drop of blood fell on the ground from that cloaked figure."How fast." The woman seemed to click her tongue in wonder as she admired that clean kill.The captain said, "It seemed we won't be able to know for now what happened. At least our dinner is arranged.""Hehe, it's been a long time since I eat the human flesh." The female spoke with ecstasy and she took out a knife.Jacob saw all that inhuman scene from the tree not far away. But he remained stoic without feeling anything and all this focus was on those three.'That captain fellow is probably a B-rank or somewhere close to it. Their skin color is also like those hob trolls I killed, which means they are from the same organization and also searching for the tiger bull. And they had some means to track it down. I should follow them,' Jacob mused.Those three cloaked figures fed on that dead human, and then they moved.But they had no idea Jacob was following them from a distance.Jacob also saw a device like a mobile phone and a red blinking dot could be seen on it and an arrow.'So, they put a tracker inside that bull's body? It seemed I have to treat this world like my own. They had everything. It's just that humans don't, so I can't keep seeing everything from their perspective anymore.'Well, it's also a good thing that I ran away or they might've caught me off guard when I was in my vulnerable state. But now… heh.' Jacob coldly smiled.Jacob followed that group for three days. He found out they won't talk with each other much and only used signals sometime or small commands. They were extremely careful to not reveal anything about their background.'Mooooowwwwww…'They all heard this ghastly roar at this moment and everything thought of the same thing.'Tiger Bull!'It was only fifty meters away from their current location.The captain signaled them with a hand and those two quickly go in a different direction and moved in.Jacob was already hiding within the trees, with no intention of joining them. He wanted to see their strength, even though he had some idea where they stand.But he was still going to enjoy the show.Those three slowly moved in with silent steps and halted.Just ten meters away from their position lay a crimson bull with tiger-like white straps around its body and a pair of crimson bullhorns.That tiger bull was munching on a big leopard, which he probably just slaughtered.The captain again signal and the other two took out their firearms. He held a silver axe in his one hand and an action pump in the other.He suddenly charged at full speed as he roared,"Attack!"

Chapter 74 Killer Skull Society (1)
﻿"Attack!"The Tiger Bull instantly notices the attackers and stands straight while lower his head. It was taking a charging stance to black the attacker with an axe and shotgun.However, before the bull could charge, gunshots rang from a distance and one of them pierce into its left eye!'Moooww!'It roared in frenzy and went berserk as it completely forgot about any pain and madly charged toward the attacker in sight!The attack with an axe was ready for this and he first took a shot at the bull's right eye, 'Boom!'The gauge was packed with special types of sharp nails and the moment it burst, the bull's head was filled with small holes as blood gushed out.However, it didn't slow it down in the least bit and it roar more violently as it charged.The cloaked man seemed to expect this and when the bull was only a meter away from him, he suddenly launched himself in the air!The bull then naturally lost its target, but the man was now in the air right above the bullhorns.Within an instant, that man through let go of his shotgun and grabbed one of the bullhorns, and somersaulted on the bull's back!The bull naturally wasn't happy about it and started to jump around to throw its attacker off!However, that man's grip was solid, and he didn't lose his balance. The very next moment thereafter, he lifted his axe and swing it with full force, and it landed right in the middle of the bull's head!Yet, it only managed to cut through the skin and little muscles, its skull was still undamaged!'That's why it's so hard to deal with!' the man thought with some frustration.But he didn't stop swinging and kept hitting the skull until it was finally broken!The bull let loose one last eerily cry before it fell on the ground with a big thump, raising a dust cloud!The other two appeared from the woods at this time."It was really intense, far better than anal!" The woman spoke hysterically."Tsk, nasty woman." The second one clicked his tough as he kept his distance and look at the man with a bloody axe in his hand."So, that's how you kill a tiger bull, huh?" His voice was filled with admiration."Heh, it's the only weak place it had. If you go for its body or neck even, then you're only wasting your energy and…"'Swish…'However, before he could finish his sentence, a dark blur flashed past his neck, like a gust of cold yet sharp wind.The other two only noticed when the body and head separated and start falling.But in this small window, another gust of sharp wind blew past that woman!Now, only the last person remains, and he only reacts when he heard his comrades' heads falling to the ground."Ahhhhh…." He screams historically and starts pulling the trigger of his gun madly, as he shot in all directions without aiming!Even after emptying it, he was still clicking the trigger while spinning like a lunatic. In the end, he exhausted himself and fell on his butt, groaning and panting."Heh, already done?"This icy voice was like a lightning bolt that jolted that fellow."P-please, I…. I don't want to die! I'll give you everything, just please let me go. I-I won't tell anyone!" He starts prostrating himself while crying.The cloak on his face also fell at this moment. It was an ugly, skinny Hob Troll.Jacob appeared in front of the crying fellow with a cold smirk on his face. He had long decided to spear this fellow because he wanted information.He had noticed while following these three that this hob troll never acts unless it was necessary, and avoided a dangerous situation while shielding himself with the other two. They were both fearless, and that woman was straight-crazy.Moreover, this fellow seemed to know about medicine. So, Jacob concluded that this fellow was afraid of death, and he was perfect to extract information from. He wanted to know just what kind of organization was behind them and why they were looking for this bull. It wasn't just a simple reason to recover that letter or kill it.It was more to their advantage if they simply let it roam freely in human towns. There was more than to meet the eye, and he wanted to know because he had this strange feeling that it wasn't over yet.All in all, Jacob wanted to know if they had a way to link all this back to him or not!"Alright, I'll let you run. But you have to answer my question first." Jacob coolly stated.The hob troll finally looked up with his snort-filled face. His eyes widened with disbelief when he saw this was a human!But he quickly nodded his head. His life was more important than some pity enmity between their predecessors."Who are you, and why are you here?" asked Jacob."I'm Skull No. D-198938833 from Killer Skull Society. As for why we were here, only he knows." Skull No. D-198938833 pointed toward the beheaded man.However, a dark blur brushed past Skull No. D-198938833's arm, and the next moment it dropped separately from his elbow!"Ahhhhhh…" He reacts a moment later and shrieks like a dying pig the next moment.Jacob coldly looked at him. "Did I forget to tell you? My bad then, listen, you fuck face, every time you lie I'll cut a part of our body, and after you left with no part, I'll skin you alive, and trust me, I won't let you die!"Skull No. D-198938833 finally spills the beans, "W-we were only told… to… to kill the tiger bull and investigate the whereabouts of a missing letter. I… I swear, he only tells us this much. Our ranks were lower than his, and he knew more details than us. Please, just let me go!""Intriguing." Jacob pulls a spooky smile at this moment, "Something tells me you have some idea why he was here. So, are you going to tell me nicely or not?"

Chapter 75 Killer Skull Society (2)
﻿Skull No. D-198938833 felt like he was stared at by a demon and horridly speak, "I-I… I think he was here for the tracker in that bull's body because it can tell us locations where it has been for the past three months."N-no, I'm sure of it because if they wanted to track the letter, they would retract the footsteps of the tiger bull to see where all it happened and find clues about it. Furthermore, I think that guy was after the titan iron cage as well because it is worth a small fortune! Please, I know nothing else!"Jacob deeply looked at the crying Skull No. D-198938833 with squinted eyes.'The tracking device can be traced back to the bull's location? If that's the case, they might really be here for that letter. But I still can't reach any conclusion right now.'He said, "Tell me about this Killer Skull Society."Skull No. D-198938833 finally felt some relief when Jacob stop questioning about the mission.He said, "It's a Dark Organization without any ties with any race or region, even if they had, with our ranking I simply didn't have the right to know. But one thing is for certain, they had ample resources."They approached me on their own accord with an invitation and if I want to join them, then I have to complete the assignment in that invitation to prove my loyalty and resolve."Then, if they are satisfied with my response… they… they sent another invitation with my special ID Number. Any future contacts were done with the same method to insure their secrecy."The current mission was the same, but this was my first time attending a team mission and meeting with others members of the society as well."Jacob couldn't help but though with a hint of astonishment in his eyes, 'They're like the sleeper cells of a terrorist organization, huh?'"What's the purpose of this Killer Skull Society and why do they approach you?" He questioned."Their dictum is they are changing the world for the better and seeking a justifiable position for us powerless. I was just a random cowardly nobody who was always bullied by the rich and that's why I agree with their viewpoint and joined their ranks."They not only give me a purpose but also wealth and help me see the hope. Nevertheless, I'm not frantic enough to die for this cause as well. I'll leave to the common region and you won't see me ever again." Skull No. D-198938833 plead.Jacob's lips curled upward. "Man, a terrorist society, really? What about the ranks? Your name is your ID, right?""They had the same rank as mercenary agency A, B, C, D, E, F, but each rank had a skull word attached to it. But we can't move up ranks like the mercenaries. We have to complete missions to move on the ladder."As for my name, from the moment we join the society, our names become our ID numbers. They encourage us to state our ID numbers instead of our names to show just how many skulls we have after us."Furthermore, the lesser the number the older and stronger the Skull is, I only know this much about it.""Hmm, interesting. So, you have no loyalty toward your kind anymore? If they asked you to cause a massacre in your kingdom, will you do it?" Jacob looked at him nonchalantly."As long as it won't endanger my life, I will. In fact, any member could do the same. They probably selected us because we have no belonging to the community. However, they never gave me such assignments to harm my kind." He answered."Last question, can you read the content of this letter?" Jacob put his hand in his side pocket and took out the same encrypted letter he looted from the three hob trolls.Skull No. D-198938833 eyes widen when he saw the letter in Jacob's hand and he looked at him in shock, "So, you were the one who intercepted the cargo?!"Jacob shrug his shoulders and coolly reply, "I was just in the area and I even asked those three to hand over that tiger bull nicely. But they disagree and now you can imagine after what happened then since I'm standing here while they're not."Skull No. D-198938833 expression turned even more grim as he looked at the nonchalant human, 'So, the bull escaped from him and he was also searching for it and we happened to bump into him?!'He took a deep breath and said, "This is my first time seeing those symbols. I never received that kind of letter. But whoever this letter was meant for, they're at the very high ranking of the society and they might've required this letter since they send us here to search for it."Jacob sneered, "Can't they just send another one? Why this bravado?""This I don't know, but if this letter was from the higher region, then I'm afraid the upper echelon in the uncommon region won't dare to report this blunder unless they're certain they can't handle the situation themselves. They might've been afraid of the punishment." Skull No. D-198938833 truthfully told.Jacob thought a moment and nodded. He also thought the same.Especially after concluding that this Killer Skull Society was like a terrorist organization, and a blunder in such an organization was unacceptable.'This mean, they'll try every means to get their hands on this letter and continue to investigate unless they hit a stone wall. Well, as long as they didn't have any A rank here, they would only deliver me more 'gifts' and make my life easier.' He suddenly smiled deviously."Thank you for your information. You can scram now." Jacob glanced at Skull No. D-198938833 and gave him the go signal.Skull No. D-198938833 had already stopped the bleeding from his severed arm and he was waiting for these exact words. He spun around the ran at full speed. "Boom!"A gunshot ran and the next moment, Skull No. D-198938833's skull was blown open!Jacob scoffed disdainfully as stored his revolver away, "I only say I let you run, not let you go free!"

Chapter 76 A Feast!
﻿Far away from the Rainy Mountain Range, inside a bright room,A burly hob troll was reading some documents with a serious expression on his face.'Took, took…'Suddenly, he heard noises from the window in on his rare.He turned around and saw a small blue bird knowing on the glass window with its small beak.He stood up from his chair and move toward the closed window and he opened it without any hesitation.The little bird flew inside and sat on his shoulder.A small smile appeared on this hob troll's ugly face as brushed his finger on the little bird's head.However, the next moment, his eyes turned icy, and he suddenly formed a pincer with his thumb and finger and instantly broke the bird's neck, killing it in an instant!"Forgive me, little one." A trace of tear appeared in his eyes as he cradled the dead bird in his hand as if he was in extreme pain.The next moment, he took out a knife from a drawer of his table and cut open the bird's belly, and startling, a small tub appeared!The hob troll took out the small tube before it picked up the bloody bird again and mumbled, "You'll live forever within me!" and then gobbled it whole!He then opened the tube, and a small chit appeared. There was writing on it,"Skull No. C-871989650 has been crushed!""Skull No. B-349032323 move out.""Assignment details and materials have been delivered into the Bank Locker!"The hob troll frowned, seeing the content before he swallowed the chit as well."No one is allowed to hinder our noble cause!"With that, he opened the door and left.---After killing the three hob-troll, Jacob finally turn his attention toward the big prize, which was naturally the tiger bull.However, he tried to pierce open its stomach. He soon found out why this bull skin was compatible with iron. He had to use his full strength to cut it open and without the titan iron blade; he was afraid no normal blade could pierce through this bull's skin.Nevertheless, he just had to work extra hard to guts this bull and he considered it an exercise for himself. After his heart's new evolution, he had yet to feel fatigued. Only hunger was his biggest enemy.But it still took three hours to completely removed the skin and inners. He had already collected the loot from his newly killed hob trolls.He got six handguns, two shotguns, and one axe, which was clearly made of special material as well. But Jacob tried to swing it on his titian blades and it didn't manage to leave a scratch, which means it was far inferior.A total of 2,674 bullets for all the firearms and mercenary IDs from the Earthen Kingdom. Three long knives and twelve small daggers from that crazy hob troll woman, 520 bronze coins, 3,904 silver coins, and 1,726 gold coins.Lastly, the tracking device that was still working and showing the dead tiger bull.Jacob had found no tracker inside the bull's body, even after looking for it. Which could only mean it was inside its head, which was still untouched by him.'This should come in handy.' He moved toward the bull's head, which was already half opened. He then put his inside its gory skull and started to search around.'Here it is!' He finally found a small gemstone that was planted right on its forehead by someone. This also explains why they needed to kill it. But it also made it clear that whoever put this inside this bull's head wasn't someone normal.After putting the tracker and tracking device away inside his storage. He looked around, and it was a huge mess. Blood and gore were all over the area and the potent smell."I can't cook it here." Jacob shook his head and picked the huge iron bull, which was now a meat slab. He also took his skin and he was planning to make clothes out of it because of its defense.As for the others, he left them for the animals to clean them. He had already taken what needed.After moving a few miles away from the kill zone, he started to make his camp and the first thing he did was light a huge fire and skewered the entire bull!Afterward, he set a nice camp before starting to tend the meat with all kinds of spices he had stored before coming here, but regretfully, they weren't enough for such a huge bull.The bull was three meters in size and one could imagine just how difficult it was to cook it whole, but Jacob still take it upon himself.He knew he can consume it whole, and he was planning to do just that before returning.After twelve hours of waiting, the tiger bull was ready to eat and Jacob didn't stand on ceremony and turned an entire leg piece and start to eat like a barbarian.The sky was already filled with rain clouds, and Jacob didn't want the meat to go bad, especially not this quality.As he ate the delicious meat, he felt the hot wave of energy spreading all over his body as his heart beat like crazing. He could literally feel meat being digested within seconds as it reached his stomach.Which made him eat even faster than he could feel his body started to get strong!It took him three hours to consume the entire bull and bone marrow even.Now he felt full of energy and his hunger was no longer apparent. But the greatest change was Jacob was now bulky, like MR. Olympia, which made him frown to no end.He didn't like this kind of physique because it restrained his movement, despite giving him a wide area of motion and strength.Then he decided with a dangerous glint in his eyes, "I'm going to compress my muscles and the best way is to practice that suicidal martial art that lunatic gave me. I never thought anyone is capable of learning it, but now I'm required such a martial art!"

Chapter 77 An Old Deal
﻿"So, Mr. Jacob, we have finalized our deal with your company!" A tall, handsome man held a campaign glass as he purposed a toast to Old Jacob, who seemed to be in his late fifties.Old Jacob looked outside the glass wall, as he can see the entire city from this floor, which was a thousand meters from the ground. His eyes were calm and uninterested in anything as he looked at the city from the very top. It was like he had lost his interest in the entire world itself."Mr. Jacob?" The tall man called again.Jacob finally looked at the man with a faint smile and nodded. "Yeah, whatever. But I still don't understand why you purpose a personal meeting while my sons can do the same. You should know I'm about to retire, and my sons will inherit my entire legacy."A wily glint flash past the man's blue eyes as he said, "I know and I'm very grateful that you agree to this meeting. I'm an admirer of yours, Mr. Jacob. You have changed the entire weapon industry in twenty years."Jacob didn't even feel anything as he said, "I heard this thing for a long time. So…" His eyes suddenly turned sharp as knives, "Why did you want to meet me? You even gave my Son a billion just to arrange this meeting."If not for your relationship with that greedy brat, trust me. I'll blow this entire city from the face of the earth and no one will even ask why I did it. So, last chance, why do you want to meet me before I'm out of here?"The man's eyes were filled with shock now, as he looked at the old man who was still as sturdy as a tower and his muscular build clearly wasn't from just exercise."Alright, since you already know about my Deal with Ryan, I'll come straight to the point. Everyone with my status knows you only show just a fraction of your research to the world and you have far more to offer, but for some reason, you held back on us…"Jacob suddenly shook his head and cut the man's speech, he said, "I've seen countless people like you who sound like they wanted to change the world for the better, but in the end, we all know you're just a power-hungry businessman who wanted to control the world. I'm not wasting my time with you anymore." Finished, he starts walking toward the door.The man suddenly panicked and blurted, "Please wait, I heard your wife has terminal cancer and you've been searching for a cure or anything that can prolong her life. I can help you with that!"Jacob's footsteps come to an abrupt halt and he finally turns around. There were ripples in his eyes, which were as cold as stone just a few moments before."What kind of help?" He asked.The man sighed in relief. "My relationship with Ryan is quite good. He told me about how you are searching for anything that can prolong life or get rid of that terminal cancer."I'm not threatening you or using this as leverage to demand things from you. I just want to trade with you. Anything that is not released to the public will be enough, and I even give Ryan half of the profits from this technology. We can sign a contract if you like." He quickly guaranteed Jacob. He knew threatening this old man was like playing with an atomic bomb naked! Jacob deeply looked at the youthful man and said, "So, that little bastard is with you in this, huh?"The man wanted to say something, but Jacob wasn't done."Fine, you win, but I'm warning you, the moment this thing comes out in this world, no one will be safe anymore. No bulletproof glass or bomb-proof technology will be able to stop this thing."So, I'm asking you again, do you really want this? People will be able to kill even you while you're drinking here from a city away. Think about it carefully or I can offer you billions for your information and 2% shares of my company. What do you think?" Jacob offered.However, greed shone in that man's eyes and he answered without even thinking as if he didn't listen to Jacob's warning at all."I want it. Wealth means nothing when you can leave your name in history!" He said with full of confidence."Heh, you're a lunatic. But since you wanted to go down in history, I'll give you the Quantum Rifle Technology." Jacob merely chuckled with a dark glint in his eyes.'You dare to use your mother to trap me? I'll make sure you'll regret it!' Jacob's eyes turned freezing."Quantum Rifle Technology?" The man mumbled with ecstasy and disbelief. He knew what quantum theory was, and it seemed Jacob has some kind of phenomenal breakthrough which was never revealed to the world.Now, he can take credit for it and become the richest man on this planet, even surpassing the current richest man who was standing right in front of him!'Swaying that greedy prick was worth it!' He thought with ecstasy.He didn't waste more time in case Jacob change his mind and quickly opened a secret safe and took out some papers and a tattered cloth which looked extremely ancient.Furthermore, he placed the papers on the table, which was the contract that stated Jacob would give this aforementioned technology to his company and won't reveal it to another company, nor can he disclose it was invented by him.Half of the profits would be given to Jacob's second son, Ryan, as well, which was the deal between them.But if Jacob played them after the deal was finalized, he will lose half of his fortune!Jacob didn't read nor did he sign it and looked at the man. "Tell me the information. If it is worth the Quantum Rifle Technology, I'll sign it."The man didn't delay and lay the tatter ancient map on the table. "This is the ancient map passed down to in our family. This led to an old shrine. I have already extracted the contents of this place and found an ancient book."After deciphering it, we found this was an ancient exercise, a martial art that can not only give fifty years of extra life if practiced successfully, its practitioner would never fall ill." He told.Jacob looked at him like he was looking at a clown. "And I'm supposed to believe that fantasy shit? Even if that's true, do you think my woman had time to practice this shit at this age? Are you fucking we me?!" He abruptly stood up in fury.The man seemed to predict it and said, "I know it sounds absurd, but do you know my age?"Jacob's eyes suddenly widen slightly as he looked at the youthful appearance of this man. "Did you practice it?"The man smiled mysteriously. He took out a folder and place it in front of Jacob.Jacob opened it and saw pictures with dates and they were clearly quite old and these kinds of cameras weren't used in this modern age.Jacob saw every photo was from this man in front of him!"If you think they are forged, you can have someone check them. I'm currently 59 years old, the same age as you or might be older. As you can see, I've found this technique in my youth and practice it ever since and I maintained my youthful appearance."It's just a pity I can't cultivate it on the second level because that is just impossible. But if you or your wife can practice this technique for five years, I'm sure you buy her more time and yourself included." The man assured with confidence.Jacob's heart was now beating quickly as he looked at those pictures. Even he could tell they weren't forged, and the man in front of him was the same person in the pictures. But he still has his doubts."If you can give me the real ancient book to examine, I'll sign this contract. As you know, I'm a man of my word or you can come to my research facility if you don't trust me." Jacob said, he was already half convinced, and this was the first time he saw hope in this so he didn't want to let this chance go.The man smiled. "You can have the original book. My family had a copy. I know you'll make the right choice, Mr. Jacob, and if you want, we can…"Jacob stood up. "No, this is the first and last deal between you and me. Unless you can offer me immortality itself, don't try to play any tricks."The man sighed regretfully, "Can you tell me why you didn't want your research to change the world?"Jacob smiled skeptically. "Why didn't you want to share this technique with the world, then?"The man chuckled, "We are both the same in the end."Jacob shook his head, "You are a blind lunatic, while I'm long past this stage!"

Chapter 78 Art Of Nature: Water Meditation
 ﻿Jacob couldn't help but felt nostalgic when he remembered that meeting decades ago and smiled lightly.'In the end, it still took them thirty years to create one Quantum Rifle, while I was completely obsessed with finding how to increase my life and grasping every straw I can.'The Art of Nature I got from that lunatic was really authentic and might be the biggest reason I lived that long. That ancient book helped Hope live another twenty years as well. But it was just too difficult to progress any higher because we start practicing it too late in our life. If we have got it in our youthful years…'Jacob couldn't help but sigh sadly, but soon he locked those sad memories deep in his mind again. Only the memories of the ancient book were left in his mind, and he completely concentrated on it.'The Art of Nature, the ancient exercise that can help humans to tap into their secret potential. It can increase the lifespan, but it was also deadly if someone makes mistakes. It can have an opposite effect as well.'That's why even that lunatic didn't dare to practice too deep into this technique. Even I, at that time, it seemed impossible to practice and thought it was probably just a legend. But now…'Jacob pulled a sharp smile on his face as he left the place to find a water source.The Art of Nature was the name of that ancient book he once trade for one of his secret technology, as well as to teach those greedy businessmen a lesson that sometimes they should leave some things to remain hidden for the greater good.Especially his second son, Ryan, who was the greediest one, and was after Jacob's hidden research all his life.In the end, he was content with the Quantum Sniper Technology because he thought it was the only technology Jacob had hidden since there didn't even dare to imagine that he could've hidden more superior technology.But no one knows just how much hid in Jacob's mind except Jacob himself.He had destroyed all this research so it would never see the light of the day after he became obsessed with increasing his lifespan. And it all started after his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer.It was at that time; that he realized that he cared about more things than his research on weapons.Anyhow, the Art of Nature was a book that was discovered from an ancient shrine deeply hidden in the ground and the book wasn't erosion even after thousands of years.Jacob found every detail before he dared to practice this method in this book. He even had someone else first practice it, just to be sure. In the end, the book was authentic and really work.But the thing was, a human can only practice the small part of the first exercise and it had five levels in total!Furthermore, there weren't any details about what these levels will do to the human body once they exercise in them. In the end, Jacob only knows the first level can slow down the aging process of cells in the human body if someone practiced it daily.The First Exercise was called Water Meditation, which included someone meditating underwater and exhaling in a unique rhythm until they were completely out of breath and felt suffocating.Then they can take only a single breath of air before doing the entire process again and they had to repeat this process for three hours, minimum.If they took even two breaths or they weren't suffocating in the water, this won't work and they had to start the entire process again.From Jacob's research, it was found that if this exercise was done correctly, the O2 in water will decrease, which was impossible for a human to achieve since they can't breathe underwater!That's why he believed what was written in the book was true.But the things went into the realm of fantasy once someone read the latter part of the Water Meditation.This includes them meditating underwater for three days and night without taking any breath of air and continuing to exhale the air in their lungs extremely slowly, and only then they'll be able to qualify to practice the second level, which was even more absurd.Anyhow, Jacob was now in a world, which was nothing but a fantasy in his previous world, so he couldn't help but think about this Art of Nature suddenly.He wanted to see if he could practice this art to a higher level or not.As for compressing his muscles with this art, it was a strange phenomenon that occurred after he held his breath underwater and exhale it at thirty minutes intervals, his muscles felt pressure with gravity.This was also the biggest reason he was never able to increase his limit from 35 minutes. His old bones weren't strong enough, and he even concluded that any adult male can only do this process for one hour before their bones will crush if they keep doing this practice.However, now his body was like the Tiger Bull and he knew just how much a freak he was with this physique. He even tried to punch a one-meter-thick tree with his full strength and almost blasted it in half!That's why he now wanted to see if he could compress his muscles while practicing the Water Meditation. Most of all, he was curious about what happened if he really can complete the first exercise.Soon, Jacob reached a small pound while only fifty meters in size. He tossed his ragged clothes and jump straight into the lake, creating a massive splash.As for any animal in it, he wasn't afraid anymore, but to his luck, there wasn't anything dangerous inside, except for some toads and tadpoles.The pond was ten meters deep, which was enough for him.He first took a deep breath before diving toward the pond bed and sat cross-legged while he put his hands on his knees and close his eyes.He was just too familiar with this process.In his previous life, he only stopped doing it after he found out there weren't any benefits left from just thirty-five-minute meditation and his old bones won't allow him to practice this exercise any longer.Anyway, as time passed, Jacob released a tiny air into the water every three minutes and continue to maintain his position.Strangely, the small tadpoles swarmed around Jacob as if he was their food but they didn't touch him and only swim around him from a small distance.Half an hour passed like this, but Jacob was still peaceful like a statue as he released his small air every three minutes.Suddenly, he felt that strange pressure again, which started to weigh down on his body from every corner. But this time, he didn't feel the urge to stop and take a breath.Furthermore, he was now feeling a strange sensation in the water as this strange misty image started to appear in his mind. For some reason, he felt the more he breathes in the three-minute rhythm, the clear that image got.One hour passed.Jacob finally started to feel the tension in his entire body, but it wasn't enough to make him give up, furthermore, he was started by the time he was underwater while continuing to release his breath.However, as soon as the one-hour limit was reached, the gravity suddenly increased visibly, as his body dug slightly under the pond bed because of its weight.'Five-time G Force, not its 10 times?!'Jacob instantly guessed, but he still felt he can hold one. But he was aghast when he thought no normal human can survive this much gravitational pull.'If this G Force increases by 10 every hour, won't someone have to bear 720-G before they would complete this level?! And is it still the minimal threshold to practice the second level?! Just what kind of person wrote that Art of Nature and how can it appear on Earth?!'Many questions rose in his mind, but he knew the answer to such questions was not just any random person could answer.Nevertheless, the misty image in his head also becomes clear while he continues to endure.His bulky muscles also broke in that pressure, and his heart beat fast to recover them. His recovery speed was abnormal with his abnormal heart.In the end, Jacob exhales his last bit of air when one and half hours passed until he started to feel suffocating in five minutes since the pressure again started to increase after this point.After one hour and forty minutes, Jacob finally couldn't endure it and stood up so he could take a breath.But his eyes almost popped up when he stood because that 10-G force still remained affix even after he open his eyes and break the mediation stance!Jacob's heart lurched. 'What the fuck is going on?!'

Chapter 79 A Raid Offer
﻿Jacob's mind accelerated when he felt the 10-G force on his entire body and he was ten-meter-deep in the pond.'Could it be I need to breathe to break free from this gravity? In the past, I was never able to increase the meditation time, so I still don't know about this particular effect. It was stupid to just practice it like this. I should've known better!' Jacob had a grave expression, as he was now suffocating under this massive weight.But he wasn't willing to die by his own stupidity, so with extreme difficulty, he started to paddle his limbs. As a result, blood oozed out of his orifices.However, he had more grave things to worry about than some blood, so after paddling for three minutes, he was only three meters away from the surface.His eyes were now bloodshot and hazy. It was his will to live that kept pushing him toward the surface.'Splash…''Coughhhhh…'The moment Jacob appeared outside the water, the pressure on him instantly vanished as he coughed uncontrollably with a pale expression.'I can't believe I nearly died the moment I let my guard down.' Furious, he swims toward the surface."Sigh…" He has a massive sigh of relief the moment he touched the ground and, with depleted energy, he lay on the muddy surface for a long time as he catches his breath."I should do this meditation on a lower water level surface in the future." He stammered and finally stood up.He couldn't help but notice his muscles were slightly compressed after this life-threatening experience.Several days later, Jacob appeared back in the Rain Town and directly headed toward Isaac Smithery to pick up his things. He was now silently planning to leave Rain Town for Lionheart City.He wanted to go there and check this apothecary guild and gunsmith guild out. Furthermore, he wanted to make weapons far more advanced than he had already seen all this time.Only then he will leave toward the Rare Region when he had complete confidence in protecting himself if he fell into some dangerous situation.As for staying here until he completed the cursed mark, he now knows better that it was just a pipe dream with only consuming uncommon animals' heart essence. He required rare beasts like Tiger Bull.Furthermore, as a result of his body growth this time, he guessed it shouldn't be wise to hasten the process too much or he might turn into a slab of muscles after 20% competition.That was why it was now inevitable for him to use the Water Mediation until he reached his previous toned physique. But he didn't dare to practice it in a deep pond or lake anymore after his previous lesson.When he reached the smithery, he felt another presence in the shop for the first time.As he entered the shop, he saw a familiar curvaceous figure standing arrogantly. It was none other than Rosalia, who had a furious expression on her face as she looked at Isaac.He entered just in time to hear Isaac's gloomy reply."Miss, your sword is beyond repair. Please don't be unreasonable, you can buy a new one or I can reforge it for you. But I can't restore it."Rosalia and Isaac's argument came to an abrupt halt when they noticed Jacob entering the shop.Rosalia's eyes widen when she saw the burly man with silver hair, and couldn't help but remembered a certain someone who rejected her team-up offer when she registered with Rain Town's mercenary agency.Isaac was also startled because the change in Jacob's physique was too great to be not noticed.However, Jacob wasn't fazed by their gazes and said nonchalantly, "Is everything ready?"Rosalia's face fell when she heard the familiar arrogant voice, and she knew it was indeed the same person.Isaac, on the other hand, smiled meaningfully. "Yes, sir. I was waiting for you all this time. Everything is ready and in the storage room. Please wait while I handle the customer, then I'll show you the goods."Jacob coolly nodded. It was indeed not wise to reveal the things he was about to pick up."So, what do you decide, Miss?" Isaac looked at Rosalia with an aggrieved expression, because she was being unreasonable and arguing with him over her broken sword.Rosalia coldly said, "I want my sword to restore, but you didn't have enough skills so, you're finding excuses. Hmph, just trash in the small trash town!"Fuming, she picked up her black blade sword and stomped out of the shop before giving Jacob a death glare, which he completely took as a wind.Isaac's expression was also livid, but he knew that the woman was dangerous and if Jacob wasn't present, she might've not left with just humiliating him. He's been there before."Please follow me." Isaac beaconed Jacob toward the underground storeroom.Inside the storage room, there were three crates separate from the other materials, and Isaac opened the lid to show Jacob the goods.The size of three crates was two cubic meters, and two of them were filled with titian iron bricks, neatly arranged. The last one was filled with gun barrels, bullets, and small pieces, which were also for firearms.Isaac said with a hint of pride, "I hope you're not disappointed. There are 166 Titian Iron Bricks and, as per our agreement, I took five of them."Jacob nodded slightly. "Seal them."Isaac sealed the crates as he was told, and Jacob picked them with little difficulty."It was a pleasure dealing with you," Isaac said while Jacob was leaving.Jacob chuckled and nodded slightly before he left the shop with three crates in his hands.However, as Jacob was heading toward his house, his eyes squinted ever so slightly before his lips curled into a wintry smile.Suddenly, Jacob picked up speed, and soon, he was jumping on people's rooftops while holding the crates like they were feathers.Not far away from him, a shadow suddenly flashed past some buildings as it heeled him, but Jacob's speed was still superior and he remained ahead no matter how much that shadow try to catch up to him.Soon, Jacob reached his house and landed in the small backyard, and put the crates down without breaking any sweat.He finally looked at the wall and said coolly, "So, what do you want?""You're quite impressive for a C Rank." Just as this crisp, icy voice trailed off, a figure jumped inside Jacob's courtyard and it was none other than Rosalia.Jacob chuckled, "And you're not just a D Rank." His eyes suddenly turned murderous. "Last chance. Why did you follow me?"'What is this feeling?' Rosalia's eyes shimmered with a trace of fear. She felt like just been gawked by a rare beast. But she had her own pride and thought it was just her imagination and brushed it off.She said, "Since you've figured it out, I won't beat around the bush this time. I'm indeed a C Rank, but I can't tell you my background. As for why I follow you, I wanted to see if you're qualified to join this expedition. Which is the real reason I'm in this town."Jacob's expression remained apathetic. "I'm not interested. Leave before I change my mind."He had long guessed this woman was nothing but trouble from their first meeting, and now he appeared right as well. She wasn't just any random girl, and she was here for something which might bring nothing but trouble.Besides, there wasn't anything she can offer that can arouse his interest except if she offered a few rare beast hearts and blood, which he knew was impossible for these people.Rosalia's expression clouded when she heard his arrogant reply. She couldn't help but gritted her teeth as she said, "Not even a hidden Green Goblin research facility?!"Jacob's expression twisted when he heard 'Goblin'. If he hated any race in this world the most, then it would be the Goblin race, without any doubt. These little monsters were just too hateful."Why the fuck do I want to raid their facility? Do you think I'm a fool? You're just here to take all those benefits for yourself, or I don't believe you won't have the means to hire some other C Rank mercenaries."Either this facility is too dangerous or you got this information from someone else and do not want to share it with other powers so you can take whatever in this research facility to yourself!"Now don't waste my time and get out before I throw you out myself, and trust me, you don't want that to happen."Despite his hatred for the goblin race, he wasn't foolish enough to mess with them just because someone else said so.The Goblin Race was spread in the rare region where humans were extremely rare and probably sold like slaves, just like this body's previous owner!

Chapter 80 Brain Hunter
﻿With Jacob's slighting attitude, Rosalia couldn't help but grit her teeth, but she had this dangerous feeling about this man, so she had no choice but to give up any idea of attacking. She didn't want to reveal her strength here and startle some wrong people.Disgruntled, she replied, "Fine, you can remain stubborn. But now that you know about this information, I don't want any rumors floating around, or trust me, you'll regret it!"Just as she arrived, she jumped the wall and left without caring about Jacob's reaction.Jacob sneered, "She's overestimating herself."He picked up the crates and take them to the basement. He was planning on hiring a horse carriage in the morning and leaving this place.But there was one last thing he needed to take care of.As he entered the basement, and place the crates in a corner and moved toward the back wall. He suddenly starts plucking the old bricks from a point and kept going until a bonny figure appeared with a pig head.It was indeed Jacob's first 'companion' who escaped Decker's clutches and fell into his.If Jacob felt any kind of emotions for anyone in this world, it would be none other than Pig Head since he also lived in the same environment and they travel together and Pig Head has protected him many times.But regretfully, without those special liquid tanks, Pig Head was as skinny as Jacob when he first appeared in this world. Now, their roles completely changed, as Jacob now had the same physique as the Old Pig Head.He had hidden Pig Head here in the hope of finding those liquids, but he didn't encounter anyone who knows about them. Not even the Star Mercenary Agency warehouse has them. He had seen the list of goods in their shop.Now, not only Jacob was as strong as the Old Pig Head, stronger even. He found it more convenient to move alone. He didn't need a bodyguard anymore, especially a bodyguard who had a completely unknown mechanism.Pig Head didn't have a beating heart nor did it breathe, but it can move and follow every kind of command and Jacob mused, that it was probably some kind of bioproduct of Decker's research.He still had Decker's journal, which he didn't get the time to complete yet.Jacob looked at Pig Head's completely dried-up body as some kind of black pigment was leaking from its orifice and it was only standing because Jacob hadn't removed the bricks from its entire torso."Sigh… it seemed you're already dead." Jacob sighed with a hint of regret as he looked at the gem bracket in his hand. "I should take his parasite gem as well. It was probably a higher level than mine. Don't worry, I'll keep this parasite gem as a remembrance of yours."He draws his short sword and cradled its dark blade horizontally, just slightly below its pig ear and eye socket."Goodbye."Finished saying, his hand instantly moved in a blur-like motion and flashed past its entire face like it was a piece of butter.The very next moment thereafter, a clean black line appeared, which was black blood.Jacob pushed its head slightly with the blade and the head slide down like a cap and opened half of its face!Jacob didn't want to damage the gem so he simply cut half of Pig Head's skull, separating the brain with it at the top as well.Now it was very simple to retrieve the parasite gem.However, when Jacob was about to crouch down to search for the parasite gem, his eyes opened wide slightly when he noticed the movement in that dark brain matter on the floor, which looked extremely rotten.Thereupon, he saw tiny tentacles before a seven inches worm-like thing crawled out of that dark matter!'A centipede?!' Jacob instantly recognized.This centipede was pitch black, seven inches long centipede with thirteen body segments. It was eyeless and instead; it has two pairs of red antennas, on each side of its head and 24 pairs of black legs. Strangely, this centipede stopped a few inches away from Jacob while keeping its red antennas swaying.This strange action also stopped Jacob from stomping on it."This?" His eyes suddenly widened before a strange idea appeared in his head. He couldn't help but look at the gem bracelet, which he thought was some high-level parasite gem control."Move back." He said as he looked at the centipede with a hint of uncertainty.The very next moment, that dark centipede instantly followed what Jacob said and move back in a straight line."Stop!"It stopped!"Form a circle."It turned into a centipede ring!Jacob's eye shimmered with astonishment and elation, "Just what kind of insect is this? It can understand and follow my command and it can probably control a dead body as well. That's why I never felt Pig Head's heartbeat or breathing, nor did I discover its existence. I wonder how that bastard (Decker) got it and from where?"He had no information about the insects, and a tiny group of extremely dangerous insects was noted in the book he had on beasts.'I should ask the expert. I need to know more. Cursed Immortality!'He knew if anyone in the world had unparalleled knowledge about the living; it was probably this book.The moment Immortika appeared, strings of words appeared."Hahahaha… you finally found it and here I presumed you'll leave this little toy somewhere or will kill it accidentally. But I have to give you credit for precisely extracting it."Jacob's face turned dark when he read it and couldn't help but cussed, "I have urged to shoot a bullet in your wily-ass. Now, cut the nonsense and tell its specie in detail.""Hahaha… try it!" It wrote impetuously first, which made Jacob even more exasperated.But he didn't rebuke anymore, since he knew this sadist book will just keep going on and on with its sadist laugh.Then it finally answered the real question:"Tsk, tsk, you're no fun. Anyway, that centipede is called Eclipse Alipes Imhoff. You can simply call it a Brain-Hunter as well. It's a Tier-9 species."As for why they called the Brain Hunter, it's because they lived inside brains for the most part of their life and can't live more than a month without a healthy brain. They not only slowly consumed the rich brain matter, but they can control their host bodies' every action and they are extremely intelligent!"A completely mature Brain Hunter has already changed over twenty hosts in its life. As for this one, it's only half mature and can only take control up to tier-6 species, any higher and it'll die."A mature Brain Hunter had over thirty body segments and they're extremely deadly as they control up to tier 12 species and lived for almost two hundred years if they keep changing their hosts. They can even speak the language of their host and mimic their heartbeat and breathing habits."That's why it's extremely hard to identify mature ones. You might be living with one and having passionate intercourse with it daily, you would never know. Hahahahaha…"Jacob's expression turned dark from astonishment when he read the last comment.But he was more aghast as he glanced at the obedient Brain Hunter a few inches away from him.'According to Immortika, Rarer species fell into tier 6 to 9 group, which means this Brain Hunter is a peak tier Rarer species. Although this looks just like a harmless centipede, no one would ever know this thing is highly intelligent and can even mimic other behaviors.'So, this is what a Rarer species can do! But how the hell does that fucker (Decker) get his hands on it and have it under control?' He felt a faint chill in his spine just thinking about it."Then how is it under control of this gem?" He couldn't help but ask."That's for you to find, remember I can't answer questions other than those related to the scripture. Hahahaha…"Jacob sneered, "You just want to keep yourself entertained. Nonetheless, just tell me if it'll die in the pendant space after a month or if it'll remain in this state as long as I keep it there?""Oh, what a cunning question. You want to research how it was controlled and wanted to see if it'll escape out of your clutches if you let it consume more brains. You are quite predictable."Hehehe… nevertheless, the answer to your question; yes, you are right about the pendant space. As long as you keep it there, it'll appear outside in the same condition you put it in. You should be thanking…""Scram!"Jacob instantly closed the book after getting his answer. He simply can't endure its antics for long.He finally looked at the Brain Hunter and crouched down with cold light in his eyes. "Come here."He put his hand on the floor and the Brain Hunter instantly zigzagged and crawl on his hand and the very next moment it vanished into the space of Infinity Pendant!
