Chapter 221 Rune Artificer
﻿Jacob sat around a large bonfire as he skewered the entire Purple Vile Ape while he continued to study the last part of the type-1 rune language.By the time the meat cooked, Jacob had closed the virtual file and sighed with a hint of astonishment as he mumbled, "What a profound language. I can't imagine there might be a type-2 rank of this language."Jacob had now mastered the entire type-1 rune language, and he mused he wouldn't fall into trouble with the rune language anytime soon. Not while he was in the Rare Plains, at least.He wanted to start the Magic Rune Encyclopedia right away, but his stomach was in his way, so he decided first to eat and hopefully end the hunger with this meal. After all, this was still an extraordinary tier-2 magic beast.Within half an hour, there was only a pile of bones left, and Jacob had this satisfied look on his face while he felt unimaginable power running through his body.Jacob was no longer feeling any lingering hunger as it was now completely gone, and he was at least ten percent stronger than he was half an hour ago. He also felt a strange calm feeling in his chest, like nothing could go wrong no matter what.He then suddenly remembered something as he opened another special feature of this star watch. It was called the 'Life Force Scale.'From its introduction, Jacob found that this Life Force Scale was actually an advanced version of the Bloodline Scanning Scale Device and far more accurate than it.But he wasn't able to activate it since it needed a connection with the Star Network to function.Now that he was probably at the panicle of the Rare Plains, he wanted to measure his prowess as well as test this Life Force Scale accuracy.From his own understanding, an Extraordinary-Tier-6 should have 6 Kiloton of pure physical force. But he had no way to measure it.At this moment, the function got activated."Establishing a connection with Star ID…"Star ID detected!""Type-1 ID Detected: Faceless Ancient"Faceless Ancient has been granted free access to this function in Type-1 Category. Anything exceeding Type-1 will be charged with ZC, and a similar device will be needed!"Current Device Limit: Type-1"Do you want to Continue with Scan (Limit: Type-1)?"Jacob cocked an eyebrow, 'This thing charges ZC for each use? More importantly, it seemed my Star Privilege had other uses that I'm unaware of.'Jacob then pressed to continue. Since this thing charges ZC, then he was sure it wouldn't be as disappointing as those devices.Thereafter, the display suddenly turned light green, as well as his entire star watch, before he suddenly felt a gentle current generated on his arm, and the next moment it spread over his whole body.Jacob was astonished, but the current vanished as soon as it appeared, and the star watch stopped glowing greenly.Soon, a list showed on display."The Life Force analysis has been completed!"[Life Form]"Life Species: Unknown (In Type-1 Category),"Life Form Bloodline: Unknown (In Type-1 Category)"Life Form Sex: Male"Used Life Force (Age): 29 Years (Not accurate)"Reaming Life Force (Lifespan): Over 200 Years (Not accurate)"[Life Force Strength]"Life Force Rating: Extraordinary-Tier-6"Magic Force: NONE"Physical Force: 9.99 Kiloton"Blood Force: 999,999 (Extraordinary)"Jacob didn't pay attention to his species or bloodline since he was already numb to seeing 'Unknown' there. But he was quite astonished when he saw the Star Watch could easily estimate his lifespan. Even though it wasn't accurate, it was very close.His strength, however, came as a surprise because if this was true, then he was far stronger than any extraordinary-tier-6.As for the Blood Force, he was clueless about it like the last time. The Blood Force represents an individual's Bloodline Potential.Typically, an individual blood force never changes as everyone is born with it, and the higher the blood force, the more likely the bloodline potential.However, this didn't mean the blood force was static and couldn't be changed. For example, the Limit Break, when someone breaks into a higher level, it's supposed to be one of the ways to increase the blood force.Anyone with under 10,000 blood force had a common rank bloodline. In comparison, a species with a rare talent level will have a blood force between 10,000 and 99,999.As for a species with extraordinary potential, they will have 100,000 to 999,999 blood force!The last time Jacob had checked, he had merely 9,000+ blood force. However, now it has skyrocketed to 999,999, which simply represents the very peak of the extraordinary rank bloodline!'If I eat the Wyvern Heart, my blood force might break into a million! I wonder what the criteria of Epic, Unique, and Legendary blood force it. Their blood force will be off the charts.' Jacob thought while inhaling a sharp cold breath.Still, he was quite content with his progress and was more confident in protecting himself in the Rare Plains.He then closed the Life Force Scale and opened the Magic Rune Encyclopedia. As for absorbing the Wyvern heart, he was still not in a hurry. At least not without having ample nutrition in his pendant.The Magic Rune Encyclopedia was about the use of runes in Magic. Although it followed the same language principles, it was a completely different concept.While the Rune Language was for understanding the rune's phonetics and semantics, the Magic Rune Encyclopedia was about how to use those runes for Magic!Jacob found that the Magic Rune Encyclopedia was actually for a profession called 'Rune Artificer!'A Rune Artificer can inscribe or encrypt Runes and decrypt them.There was knowledge of the Apprentice Rune Artificer Rank, Basic Rune Artificer Rank, Intermediate Rune Artificer Rank, Advance Rune Artificer Rank, Master Rune Artificer Rank, Grandmaster Rune Artificer Rank, Senior Grandmaster Rune Artificer Rank, Elder Grandmaster Rune Artificer Rank!These eight ranks have sub-ranks, Basic, Intermediate, and Advance.Jacob felt like he had just opened a treasure chest by mistake!Without wasting time, he quickly started from the basics, which were the part of the rune symbol combination and how to turn runes into a different type of elemental energy.The more he read, the more fascinated he became as he found those without Magic could also practice as a Rune Artificer and use Magic materials instead of mana.Furthermore, even if someone had Magic, they would only be proficient in one type of element, and they had to use materials as well to make different element runes.Especially if someone is making Rune Talismans, these things were the simplest to make and required low-grade materials. However, Jacob soon found that he was getting the wrong idea when he discovered that there was only one entry-level talisman for Apprentice Rank to Advance Rank.Then there was one entry-level array design for Master Rank to Grandmaster Rank.Lastly, there was one entry-level formation blueprint for Senior Grandmaster Rank and Elder Grandmaster Rank.This meant there were four talismans, two arrays, and two formations for each rank he could practice with, and all of them were future divided into three stages just like those ranks.As long as he completes the Talisman of Apprentice Rank, he will be a full fledge Apprentice Rune Artificer and so on!As for more designs, he had to rely on himself. He finally understood that he had just come out of the champion shop without even exploring the true merchandise there, which was quite regretful.Still, he was more than content with this much, and he wasn't worried about not having anything else to practice with since there was still an unknown array of parchment sitting in his pendant.So, he started to remember everything and then practice later. It will be easier this way.Jacob then starts his journey like before as he walks toward the Dark City while learning the way of a Rune Artificer with solemnity.However, on the second day, Jacob was disturbed. Not because of some beast attack but because his star watch vibrated abruptly, and a notification appeared at the screen corner, which made him frown."Might-Of-Destruction wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!"'Who the hell is he, and what did he want? Since he could send me a Projection Call then, this means he had a high-tech Star Watch like me. I better ignore it.' Jacob simply turned off the Notification and continued.However, he was stunned when his Star Watch started to vibrate again after 10 seconds.This time the same Notification rang but with an extra note which made Jacob's eyes winded."Might-Of-Destruction wanted to send you a Projection Call!""Accept / Reject / Projection Setting!""(NOTE: Might-Of-Destruction has used Star Privilege to send an unignorable Call Request. Might-Of-Destruction Star Privilege is higher than You (Faceless Ancient), Notification can't be ignored, Star ID can't be blocked!)"Jacob was frozen on his spot, 'Someone with at least Type-2 Star Privilege is contacting me?!'

Chapter 222 Might-Of-Destruction
﻿Jacob was vigilant when he guessed the possible background of this Might-Of-Destruction.'Why would someone with such an identity contact me? Now how did he get my ID name, and from where?' The more he mulled over it, the more confused and apprehensive Jacob felt.In the end, Jacob decided to accept the call before he made his watch's projection setting 'Blurry Black.' He didn't even want to show his masked face to whoever this person was.The next moment, a blurry red figure's projection suddenly formed over his wrist, and a deep voice filled with natural arrogance sounded, "Little guy, you're quite daring to ignore my call, and now you're even hiding your face!"Jacob frowned as he looked at the blurry hologram and calmly said in a cold tone, "I could say the same to you. Besides, I don't think you would be free enough just to answer any random call either, right?"Now, tell me what you want and how you get my Star ID. I'm sure you're not bored enough to search just random names and then use your Star Privilege even to force some random nobody to have a chat!"Jacob didn't mince his words. Although he knew the other party might have a terrifying background, so what?He was in the middle of the wilderness, and he was pretty sure no one will be able to threaten him in rare plains. So he didn't have to listen to the other party's bullshit."Hahahaha… interesting. You're indeed interesting!" The other party guffawed instead of getting angry as if he was amused by Jacob's fearlessness.Jacob frowned as he nearly cut the communication but still was patient enough to wait. He wanted to know why this guy was contacting him and for what reason.Furthermore, the Star Network was probably not entirely confidential because of the Star Privilege existence. He was quite familiar with such a system. It was probably like a database formed by a corporation, and the higher your position, the more secrets you could access.Still, he knew such Star Privilege wouldn't be just given to any random person. He only got the type-1 Star Privilege because he was the sole champion of the rare plains trial.Although he didn't know what other method someone had to use to acquire the same Star Privilege, it might not be so simple, not to mention someone with type-2 or higher star authority.Might-Of-Destruction stopped laughing as he meaningfully said, "Faceless Ancient, you alone cleared the Rare Plains Trial in less than a year's time right under the nose of those corpses. I must say you are quite something!"Jacob's eyes widened when his secret was revealed like it was nothing, and he knew his guess about the Star Privilege was quite on point."Who are you, and how do you know this?!" He still pretended to panic to acquire more information.Now he was even more sure this person was not a native of rare plains!Might-Of-Destruction chuckled, "Now that's more like it. Since you have kicked those corpses in the balls, I'll tell you who I am!"I'm the Chairman of Zodiac Warrior Alliance of Epic Plains, Gunnar!"Jacob was stunned when the other party revealed his identity like it was nothing but a trifle thing.'Chairman of Zodiac Warrior Alliance of Epic Plains, then this person might be as strong as an Epic-Tier-9!' Jacob presumed since he knew the Chairman of the strongest hegemony wouldn't be a weakling. Gunnar chuckled at this moment, "Stunned, right? You might be confused about what is the 'Epic Plains' and if I'm playing a joke on you. Rejoice, I'm not!"The Epic Plains are plain higher than Rare Plains, and Epic Rank is above the rank of Extraordinary. Consider this information a greeting gift!"Jacob was momentarily speechless by this man's loose mouth. Still, he didn't want to antagonize the other party anymore since he was destined to come in contact with Gunnar because of his affiliation with the alliance.There was no need to make such an enemy as long as there was no need to, especially when he was the weak one."I apologized for my previous rudeness since I never thought I would be personally contacted by Chairman Gunnar of all people." Jacob mildly spoke."No worries, even your plains four freedom lords don't have the right to speak to me like this, so it's only natural you will feel this way." Gunnar chuckled as he really didn't mind.'What freedom lords?' Jacob was baffled by it since it was the first time he had heard such a term.Still, he didn't show his ignorance and replied, "Indeed, but why do I have this honor? How may I help you?""I don't like talking with blurs!" Gunnar's tone suddenly turned sharp as he stated.Jacob frowned as a hint of killing intent flashed past his eyes before he turned to normal as he calmly said, "I'm afraid I can't remove the blur right now. Or you will see something unpleasant unbecoming of your status, chairman. Please forgive me."Gunnar remained silent for a moment before he sneered, "Hah, you're really something. Still refuse to show your face despite knowing who I am. Very well, I will get straight to the point, I have seen your data, and you are already affiliated with Zodiac Warrior Alliance."As long as you manage to become Rank-1 Zodiac Warrior in 5 years, I'll send someone to pick you up. This is only a one-time offer, and if you fail, I'd personally revoke your Alliance membership."Trust me; I have the authority to remove any reserve member and even ban them from entering the original alliance forever. The alliance has no place for weaklings!"Gunnar's voice was icy cold at the end before his projection vanished. He had cut the call without even waiting for Jacob's reply.Jacob remained standing on his spot for a moment in a daze before he chuckled as his expression went dark with forbidding, "You have the authority to remove the reserve members? Then you have no control over ranked members, I guess."Jacob wasn't planning on leaving the Rare Plains until he thought he was ready to leave. Especially not with someone stronger than him and then being controlled by them.As for reaching the Rank-1 Zodiac Warrior, it was a piece of cake for him. Five years were too long, and Gunnar will be going to regret ever revealing such a crucial piece of information to Jacob because of his arrogance!

Chapter 223 Physical Aspect
﻿After his small 'chat' with Gunnar, Jacob tries searching for his ID on the star network, but he soon finds out he can't, despite having his ID name.Jacob assumed that the Star Privilege might also have a privacy function, which means only someone with equal or higher Star Privilege could search IDs with Star Privilege while those with lower Star Privilege couldn't!This also means no one would be able to search Jacob's ID unless they had a Star Privilege equivalent to him or higher, like Gunnar!Although this made Jacob uncomfortable, he could accept it since this gave me an advantage over many.Still, he was now even vigilant of the Star Network because if someone with high Star Privilege could find out about him being the champion of the Dark Ruins, then they could also discover his location through the star watch.This wasn't entirely impossible since he had done such things in the past as well. In his previous world, with his authority and status, he could easily make the government reveal someone's whereabouts or even make them search for the target.So, Jacob decided to put the star watch into the pendant whenever he wasn't using it because only then would he feel completely safe.pαпdα`noνɐ1`сoМ Still, he wasn't overly worried that Gunnar would come after him in the rare plains. That guy might not even consider him worthy of paying attention. He might only be interested in him because he cleared the dark ruins in such a short time.That's why Jacob merely scoffed that guy off and stopped worrying about him and would only think after he entered the Epic Plains.So, he continued his study of the Rune Artificer while he started walking toward the Dark City.This time, Jacob experienced another ambush from the sky. It was a five-meter in size silver beak eagle, another tier-2 extraordinary magic beast that had a terrifying wind speed magic.But Jacob easily dodged its areal charge and killed it by using his sword as a throwing knife before it could fly away.Of course, he didn't forget to record it with the alliance application and sent it back. His rank instantly raised to 3-star nightmare warrior knight, and he continued his journey.As he entered deep into the magic beast forest, the attacks became more frequent. He even unknowingly entered an extraordinary-tier-4 Longtail Wolf den when he entered the inner region of the forest.They could easily use water blades like magic and were not taken lightly. So, getting rid of those persistent wolves took him a while.But this also helped him amass a large amount of high-quality wolf meat, and his pendant was almost filled with nothing but meat at this moment.So, Jacob felt he was and decided to consume the Wyvern heart tonight!He was already a 4-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight already, and the promotion mission for the 5-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight startled him.'Zodiac Warrior Alliance ID: Faceless Ancient'Current Rank: 4-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight (Reserve Zodiac Warrior)'Next Rank: 5-Star Nightmare Warrior Knight'Mission''Promotion Mission Available: 3'(NOTE: Complete any one of these missions to promote!)'1. Sent a Recording of You (Faceless Ancient) Defeating ten 4-Star Nightmare Knights at the same time (Fighter or Magic) in Nightmare Warrior Arena.-Reward: Rank Promotion, 1,000 ZC, A 5-Star Rare Fighter Skill[Star Recording?](Note: Only Recordings taken with this application will be accepted!)'2. Sent a Recording of You (Faceless Ancient) killing ten Extraodnary-Tier-5 Beasts at the same time.-Reward: Rank Promotion, 500 ZC, A 5-Star Rare Fighter Skill[Star Recording?](Note: Only Recordings taken with this application will be accepted!)'3. Sent a Recording of You (Faceless Ancient) killing ten Extraordinary-Tier-1 Dark Beings-Reward: Rank Promotion, 1,500 ZC, Two 5-Star Rare Fighter Skill[Star Recording?](Note: Only Recordings taken with this application will be accepted!)'Jacob frowned since searching a group of ten or more extraordinary-tier-4 beings would be difficult. Even the Longtail Wolf Pack only had three Extraordinary-Tier-4 Wolves.Still, Jacob was quite sure he might find a large colony of beasts if he entered deep into the forest.So, Jacob decided to use the wolf den, which was a large cave, as his personal resting until he absorbed the Wyvern heart.Like, always, Jacob locked the cave mouth with large boulders before he sat down and meditated to reach his optimal condition. He was going to start the second stage, so he didn't want to mess up, especially when he had a chance to acquire Wyvern's ability.After an hour, Jacob was finally ready, and a metal box appeared in his hand. Before he opened it, a 13-inches crimson heart was giving off a terrifying heat that surfaced before Jacob's shimmering eyes.'I'm glad I didn't sell it to SAAI and saved it just in case I would need it in Dark City.' Jacob sneered in his heart.Jacob wanted to use this heart in case he found something useful in the Dark City, but it was now priceless to Jacob to sell it.It was, after all, a heart of a creature with an entire bloodline of a legendary being!Without hesitation, Jacob started eating the heart, which was literally burning, but Jacob endured and ate it all while feeling the sensation of burning his internal organs without wasting anything.He had to admit even with his tier-6 extraordinary physique, the heart could still make him feel like he was swallowing burning coals.But Jacob didn't have to feel that burning sensation for long because, within moments, his heart suddenly picked up speed, and before he knew it, he was already in 10X acceleration!However, Jacob didn't panic since he had complete control over his heart rate now, and even 15X acceleration won't faze him much.At this moment, he felt something melting in his stomach, which started spreading in his veins and bloodstream.Without any explanation, Jacob knew the process had been started, and he was feeling molten lava running through his blood vessels right.As time passed, Jacob started to feel a strange cold sensation within his veins while the fiery sensation settled down.The cold sensation also didn't last long before it was gone as well, and Jacob's heart rate returned to normal.'That's it?' Jacob was confused and somewhat disappointed since he hadn't awakened any of the Wyvern's abilities.He could only sigh in bitterness and opened Cursed Immortality to see how much progress he had made with the Wyvern's heart.______[First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Blood Condensing (Second Stage)]-Cursed Blood Condensing Progress: 04.99%[Description: Convert your blood into Cursed Blood until it reaches 100% completion by Absorbing the Heart Blood of Legendary Beings or their decedents.]---Completion of this stage will result in 500 Years of Lifespan______Jacob frowned and mumbled, "Not even 5% percent?"The page turned on its own as Immortika's scornful words appeared, "Do you even know with just 4.99%, as long as you quench your hunger, you are already as strong as a Tier-1 Epic Rank Being?"Jacob was startled and stated his confusion, "But I don't feel any hunger, like before?"Immortika wrote something which made Jacob widen his eyes in shock, "It's because you have awakened one of the Wyvern's strongest physical aspects, its Endurance!"Simply put, a Wyvern can sleep for hundreds of years in a hibernation-like state without eating or using any type of energy because of its terrifying Endurance!"Although it's not much of an ability, a Wyvern's Endurance is far more powerful than any being without a legendary bloodline. Especially for someone like you!"Realization dawned upon Jacob as he quickly understood what Immortika meant by those words and asked, "So, I can even annex someone's physical aspects besides its abilities? Why didn't you say it so before?""Hehehehe, isn't it the same thing?" Immortika questioned.Jacob's face fell and refuted, "Fuck, no!"Immortika laughed, "Well, I guess you're right. Since the physical aspects involved someone's eyes, horns, skin color, wings, or even tail, well, now you know, can you accept the change in your appearance? What if you acquired a beast's tail, four arms, or spider-like legs?"The question dumbfounded Jacob, and his heart turned cold since he had never thought there was such a possibility of a change in physique.Can he live with another form but human if it means acquiring immortality? This was really the question worth mulling over, but Jacob knew what he would choose every single time.So, he took a deep breath and said emotionlessly, "In the end, the body is only skin and flesh. Appearance meant nothing in the grand scale of the universe. Especially if everlasting life was on the life, I'm sure anyone would choose even to give up anything for such a chance, much less physical appearance. So, you should stop doubting my resolve!"Immortika laughed and filled the entire page after hearing Jacob's answer before it wrote just two words at the end, "… Don't worry!"

Chapter 224 Continue Into The Magic Beast Forest
﻿Jacob frowned when he saw 'Don't worry' and sternly questioned, "What do you mean by 'don't worry'?""Hoh, did I say something?" These words appeared the next moment.Jacob's expression fell the moment he read those words, and he knew this book was again messing with him. However, he suddenly felt like sleeping, and he instantly knew the hunger was acting up.Although he had acquired the fire wyvern's endurance, but he couldn't just sleep for hundreds of years to sustain himself."Stop messing around and tell me how this endurance works exactly!" Jacob sternly questioned."Tsk, tsk, what a simple question, sigh… I have to tell you everything in the end. The Endurance of this Wyvern will raise your Endurance to the level of a Unique Rank Wyvern."Your human body will no longer waste any extra energy as it did before, and all required energy to move your body or do tasks or fighting has been decreased by 90% with your current level."But you will feel the urge to sleep all the time if you're about to run out of energy in your body. It's a sign of hibernation, but unlike Wyvern, which can absorb the energy from the environment to recover while in hibernation, you will sleep to death because you didn't have such an ability."So, I suggest you won't fall asleep without an empty stomach, hahaha… Lastly, the endurance will be decreased as your power rises until you surpass the unique rank."This is the only flaw of Physical Aspects like endurance, agility, strength, magic talent, and so on. They are not yours, so they will become useless in time as you continue to increase your prowess."So, I strongly suggest you won't get used to them because they will not increase like abilities and will lose their effect with time. If you have killed a peak epic rank wyvern, then your endurance will be of legendary rank Wyvern, what a pity, right…hehehe."Jacob felt somewhat regretful after this revelation, "So to say, the physical aspect will be like temporary boosts while the abilities can increase with my own power?""Exactly. But not all the physical aspect is like this like if you awake a legendary creature's eyes which can grow with magic or evolve with some other materials, you will naturally inherit that aspect as well."Lastly, if you awake the same kind of physical aspect again that you already had, it will either override the old one or not activate at all."Like if you awake the endurance aspect of some other species again, if it's stronger than the Fire Wyvern Unique Rank Endurance, it will instantly override it. While if that aspect is weaker, then it won't be active at all!"Jacob's eyes shimmered in understanding after reading this, 'So, I don't have to worry about replacing the useless aspect at all!' Although the physical aspect was somewhat weak in comparison to the ability, if he got an overpowered physical aspect, then it was even more valuable than an ability that would only increase with his own power.After asking some more questions, he closed the book, and without hesitation, he started to eat like crazy. He ate until he no longer felt sleepy anymore, and he could now even feel his body getting stronger with every beast he consumed at a terrifying pace.Another week passed like this, and almost all the meat in Jacob's pendant that he had accumulated had gone. But Jacob still had this lingering feeling of sleepiness, but not like before when he felt he wouldn't be able to wake if he feels into asleep.It was more like a sleep where he would stop using his energy and fall into a standby-like state. After some experiments, Jacob can easily feel into this state and awake within a moment's notice.'It seemed I had to eat tier-6 extraordinary meat if I wanted to complete my Epic-Tier-1 body. But I still haven't any clue about magic. What a waste…' He thought bitterly.Jacob was already strong enough to kill anyone in the rare plains, but he still hadn't had a trace of magic which was his only regret now. Still, he knew this thing couldn't be hurried or forced.So, without wasting more time, Jacob continues his journey toward the dark city as well as continues his study of Rune Artificer. He was already at the Senior Grandmaster Rune Artificer Rank part and only the Elder Grandmaster Rune Artificer Rank away from remembering the entire Magic Rune Encyclopedia.Although he won't be a true Elder Grandmaster Rune Artificer, but he would be as knowledgeable as one. When he had the time, he would practice as well.He was now in the magic beast forest's inner region, and anyone with a sane mind would try their best to hide their presence since this place was filled with vicious beasts.But Jacob walks like he owns the place while completely focusing on his star watch. After he awakens the Wyvern Unique Rank endurance, his mental endurance is enhanced, as well as his physical endurance.The magic beast attacks become more frequent as they all think of Jacob as easy prey.But no matter what kind of ambush they performed, whether it was a physical attack from close quarters or a magic attack from shadows, Jacob always managed to block it in the nick of time and kill them before they even had the chance to react.This way, Jacob also continued to eat while he visibly felt he was getting closer and closer to acquiring an Epic-Tier-1 physique, and the effort he had to put into killing those magic beasts was also becoming lower.Two days later, after Jacob continued his journey, he finally remembered the entire Magic Rune Encyclopedia!But he didn't even waste a moment before he opened the Philosopher's Language, which was the language of Alchemy.After comprehending the Rune Language, Jacob found that the Philosopher Language's difficulty decreased exceptionally, or it was the case because he had some understanding of this language before.Whichever the case was, it only took him half a day to completely comprehend the type-0 Philosopher's Language.Jacob also realized that the language he learned in the common plains was nothing but a fragment of type-0 Philosopher's Language!

Chapter 225 Rare Dark City (1)
﻿The core region of the Magic Beast Forest was filled with territorial magic beasts, and there wasn't even a single magic beast below the rank of extraordinary because they couldn't survive there.The deep one goes toward the central area, and the chance of stepping into some dreadful magic beast's territory would increase exceptionally.But if someone reached this area, they found themselves staring at an extensive canyon around a massive waterfall.However, an even more absurd thing was on the right steep wall of this canyon, over 300-meter high, there was a fifty-cubic meter, glistering black block, and it was extremely eye-catching in this kind of scenery.Not only that, but there was a road-like platform in front of this black block, and its size was exactly the same as it was made for others to stand on it. But there was no road that led to this platform, and underneath was nothing but steep cliff and raging Great Star River!But at this moment, a tall hooded figure clad in black was standing on this platform as he looked at the glittering black block with great interest in his amber eyes.This person was naturally Jacob, who had just reached here a few moments ago.He couldn't help but look at the virtual map on his star watch and the red mark continuously blinking right where he was standing.Jacob couldn't help but mumble, "Just who built a city in the middle of a fucking cliff? And where the heck is the city anyway?"If he hadn't seen this black block and platform, he won't have even bothered to climb up here and would have thought that this was some kind of error in the map.However, there was no trace of any city here at all, and he couldn't help but start to wonder if the Dark City was playing some kind of joke with those who sought it in this extremely dangerous place.Still, since he was here, he won't be going back without even trying. So, he touched the black block, trying to see if there was some kind of mechanism hidden within.The moment Jacob's hand touched the black block's smooth surface, the black block suddenly lit up in white, and an electric voice sounded all of a sudden."Welcome to the Rare Dark City, Esteem Wanderer!"Please Identify yourself!"Seeking permission to scan the Star Watch"Will you accept?"Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he heard the voice and the same words on the black block, 'It's a screen?'He had only been in the uncommon region's dark city, and that place was not so advanced, so he was now curious about what the biggest dark city of the rare plains would be like.So, he didn't hesitate and gave permission to scan his identity before he activated an 8-Star Nightmare Knight Badge.Thereby, a red ray shone directly on the star watch before it vanished.The electric voice rang again, "Identity Scan Complete!"Faceless Ancient (8-Star Nightmare Knight)"Dark City Status: Guest"Dark City Criminal Record: None"Dark City Noble Title: None"Guest (Faceless Ancient), you are qualified to enter the Rare Dark City."Please Answer Three Entry Questions:"1. Are you aware of Rare Dark City Rules?"Yes/NO"NOTE: If NO, please buy the Rule and Guild Book (100 Gold Coins)"2. Are you a Wanted Criminal in Rare Plains?"Yes/NO"NOTE 1: The Dark City reserve all rights to investigate the 'Answer' at any time, and it might have consequences if the answer does not match the investigation result, so please be honest."NOTE 2: Your answer will not be disclosed to anyone under any circumstance, and only in case you broke the Dark City Rule will this information can be disclosed to Dark City's Administrator!"3. Are you willing to abide by all the rules of Dark City, and in case you break it, you are aware of the consequences?"Yes/NO"Jacob's eyes went cold when he looked at those three questions. These questions were clearly to make it clear that the rules of Dark City's rules shouldn't be broken, and they were absolute.Furthermore, they even put a Rule and Guild Book, so no one was able to feign ignorance if they broke any rules.This puts his mind at ease since he can stay here without getting worried about anyone attacking him or playing any tricks while remaining in the city.So, he decided to buy the Rule and Guild book since 100 gold coins were nothing but chump change for him at this point. After the amount was deducted from his account, he received a virtual file of Rule and Guild Book. He'll read it once he enters the city.Jacob then tapped into the answers without hesitation, except for the second question. He answered everything as yes. He wasn't a wanted criminal of Rare Plains, and neither he had any enmity with Freedom Plains.Thereby, the electric voice rang again,"Thank you for your cooperation."Now Please Choose Your 'Rare Dark Pass' and 'Name'"Your Name Here?"5 Days Pass: 100,000 Gold Coins"15 Days Pass: 125,000 Gold Coins"30 Days Pass: 150,000 Gold Coins"60 Days Pass: 200,000 Gold Coins"120 Days Pass: 350,000 Gold Coins"NOTE 1: You can choose any random name, and this name will mirror your name in all transactions made within Dark City!"NOTE 2: When the selected 'Rare Dark Pass Timer' reaches ZERO, you'll have 60 minutes to leave the Dark City or Recharge the timer again. "WARNING: If you neglect this, the Dark City Guards will detain you and impersonate you in the dungeon for six days and receive 1st Degree Torture. After your detention, you'll be banned from entering the Dark City for 5-months.""So, this place also has the same entry pass and even harsher punishment. But it's far more expensive than the common plains." Jacob mumbled.Nevertheless, he was quite happy about the 'NOTE:1' because this would mean no one would know his real Star ID as long as he won't disclose it himself. He never thought the Dark City had such a function.As long as his safety and privacy were guaranteed, Jacob won't mind paying this small price, so he selected the 120-Day Pass without hesitation!

Chapter 226 Rare Dark City (2)
﻿The moment Jacob made his selection, his star watch vibrated, and a UI (User Interface) appeared, which was actually a request from the Dark City AI for the payment.After he accepted, the payment was transferred, and the next moment, he received a virtual badge like the identity badge.It was a badge with a Dark-Capped symbol on a white triangle shield, but unlike any other identity badge in his possession, there was a timer below this badge, and it was running like any timer clock.120-D: 23-H: 59-M: 57-S…Jacob was quite familiar with both this symbol and this timer. It was the symbol of the Dark City, the entry pass's timer. The only difference was it was now virtual instead of physical.The eclectic voice rang again, "You have successfully gained entry to the Dark City. You can always increase your staying limit by tapping on the badge of our Dark City from your Star Watch directly."I welcome Mr. Jack in the Dark City (Rare)!"'Jack' was naturally the fake name he had given himself.The moment the voice trailed off, a sudden beep rang before Jacob felt slight vibration beneath him.Before he could figure out what was happening, the black cube trembled before a two-meter opening slide opened in front of Jacob like a door."Please Enter!"Jacob was only surprised for a moment seeing the door within the large cube before he moved forward and entered the passage.The very next moment, the opening slid shut without leaving any trace of any opening behind.Jacob naturally saw the door closing off the moment he entered but didn't pay attention since he was now standing in a very long, light tunnel.Jacob's attention was instantly drawn by a round cable life over a platform, and there were stairs leading toward it just a few meters away from him."Please embark on the cable lift, Mr. Jack!"'They really build the city within a mountain, huh?' Jacob was intrigued as he followed the instruction and entered the cable lift. The cable lift was quite spacious for a single passenger, not to mention quite comfortable. The moment he entered the lift instantly started moving deep within the bright tunnel.Jacob was somewhat surprised since he didn't see any guards in this place, and he could vaguely see the end of the tunnel, but it was probably over three miles away, which was quite a huge difference.So, Jacob didn't waste his time and opened the guild and rule book he bought from the entrance. However, he was familiar with the rules of the Dark City from the common plains. But he was cross-matching them with this one and seeing if there were some new rules he wasn't aware of.The guild and rule book had a virtual city map on their very first page, and Jacob was quite astonished when he saw the city was over 350 square km in diameter.The Rare Dark City was divided into three Dark City Circles, the Dark Common Circle, the Dark Inner Circle, and the Dark Noble Circle.According to this book, the common circle was for those with 'Commoners' or 'Gusts' like himself. It was also where he was going.As for the inner circle, it was 100 Km deep within the Dark City. But to enter the Inner Circle of the City, one needed at least the status of Lower Dark Noble.As for the Noble Circle, only those with Dark Baron and above Dark Noble Ranks can enter that place.The Dark Noble Ranks were divided into Lower Dark Noble, Upper Dark Noble, Dark Baron, Dark Viscount, Dark Earl, Dark Marquise, and Dark Duke. Just like the dark city in the common plains.However, unlike the common plains, the Dark Noble Rank of Lower Dark Noble and Upper Dark Noble was not as hard to earn as in the common dark cities.In this place, there was no limit to the Dark Missions for the Lower and Upper Dark Noble Ranks. Nevertheless, it was still quite challenging even for someone with Extraordinary Tier Strength.But the benefits were enticing enough for many to go mad to acquire these dark noble titles.Because according to this guide, the higher the city circle one entered, the more rare and precious resources were available for them.Especially in the Dark Noble City Circle because in that place, every shop belonged to the Dark City and all the items.Even the three hegemonies were not allowed to open any kind of shop or build their symbolic buildings there. They were only limited to the Common and Inner-City Circles.Jacob's eyes shimmered in astonishment, 'If what is written in here is true, then the Noble City Circle all have resources far surpass what the three hegemonies offer, and all of them were hoarded by the Dark Nobles.'Or this might be because the Dark City is doing it on purpose, by suppressing the three hegemonies' this will compel more people to join their ranks just like what the freedom plains were doing.'If I have an opinion on the base of my personal experience up until now, one thing is clear; the three hegemonies seemed to don't care about authority in the rare plains. As long as no one provokes them, they are happy with what they have.'This could only mean the Rare Plains are not enticing enough for them to put effort. As for the dark city, they are quite a secretive and lawful bunch. As for their true goal, if I'm not wrong, it is also aligning with the three hegemonies in one way or another to draw more members!'Jacob mused while he was skimming through the guild and rule book. Within seconds, he remembered everything.This was just a small book. It was worth nothing for something like Jacob, who had already mastered more than enough knowledge to make anyone's head spin in his journey to this place, and all of that knowledge was related to incredibly complex languages, including the Language of Dead.But this was just an appetizer since Jacob still had much more complex knowledge to comprehend, and he needed a peaceful place to study them.That's why he was in the Dark City in the first place and won't leave before he was satisfied with himself!

Chapter 227 Rare Dark City (3)
﻿In the Dark Noble City Circle of the Dark City,Within a workshop filled with all kinds of alchemy equipment, a 4'2 feet person with a burly build was standing in front of a silver pill furnace with a solemn expression on his long beard face.All of a sudden, an electric voice sounded within the lab, "Lord Hallberg, there is a level-1 alert!"Hallberg's thick brows knit when he heard this and spoke in his husky voice without turning around as his green eyes were still affixed on the pill furnace, "Out with it."The electric voice rang, "A personal with Type-1 Star Privilege had entered the Dark City just a few moments ago!"Hallberg finally lost some focus as he mumbled with great interest, "Someone with Type-1 Star Privilege in the Rare Plains? Now that's interesting."According to our information network, there shouldn't be anyone with Type-1 Star Privilege in Rare Plains since there's no chance to increase the Star Privilege in Rare Plains unless someone can annihilate the entire Dark Faction from the Rare Plains."The only other way to raise Star Privilege is the Trial Plain!"Hallberg's eyes shimmered in understanding as his lips curled up in a wily smile, "So, the mysterious champion who completed the entire trial in less than six months has appeared in my Dark City, huh? Who would've thought? Really, who would've thought?"His voice turned sharp as he questioned, "Tell me his name, and did he have contact with our dark city before?"The electric voice replied, "This person's star ID is Faceless Ancient, and it's the first time he has entered any Dark City.""Any high-level affiliations with Three Hegemonies?" Hallberg questioned again."He's an 8-Star Nightmare Knight."Hallberg frowned slightly and muttered under his breath, "Then he might've already been contacted by that arrogant prick, Gunnar, and may have already joined the Zodiac Warrior Alliance as a reserve member. I can't approach him as the Dark City Lord, or this might cause trouble."After muttering to this point, he suddenly looked up and spoke, "Dark Rose, I want you to inform me if he reaches the Lower Dark Noble Rank. For now, ignore him and just treat him like other 'Commoners.' We'll see if he's interested in our Dark City or not before taking any action.""Understood, Lord Hallberg!" The electric voice or Dark Rose sounded in affirmation before turn silence.Hallberg couldn't help but sneer, "Let's see if you can escape from the mirage or not…"However, at this moment, the pill furnace started to tremble violently, and Hallberg's expression instantly went pale."Oh, fuck, not again!" He quickly turned around to flee toward the door, but before he could reach the door…"Booommm…!"---At the entrance of the Dark City.A cable lift carrying a single passenger appeared out of the deep tunnel.Jacob, who was closely looking outside, was astonished because at the end of the tunnel was a metropolis. He even thought he had come back to his own world.The only difference was this metropolis was built right in the belly of a mountain, and he had no idea how these people even thought of building this city here. Were they not afraid of burying alive if this mountain came crashing down?Still, seeing all those buildings and roads, as well as people walking around without any care about their surrounding, give Jacob some assurance. Furthermore, over 90% of these people were wearing masks, while the reaming was wearing black mantles. 'Just like the Dark City in the Common Plains, most of the people hide their identities.' Jacob mused.But this setting was quite to his liking since he also didn't want to draw any unwanted attention.The cable lift finally stopped at another station shortly after, and Jacob exited the cable lift and walked toward the exit of the station. This station was usually empty since it was only used to take the 'guests' inside the city. The exit of the Dark City was on the southern side of the city.As for any workers, according to the guidebook, this place was mostly under the management of artificial intelligence named Dark Rose.Jacob exited the building and glanced at two guards in silver and white masks standing around the door. They merely glanced at him and didn't utter any words.A glint of astonishment flashed past Jacob's eyes, 'What a powerful and sturdy heart rate. They should be at least Tier-1 Extraordinaire, if not tier-2, and they are just door guards of this entrance station.'Jacob continues to walk toward the paved road when he suddenly feels a pair of eyes on him. He had developed this habit of being always on high alert while walking out in the wilderness, and his senses were now terrifyingly high.It was half because of his new heart and half because of his Unique Endurance. Without them, Jacob would be exhausted within an hour if he was constantly on high alert, especially without unique endurance.Furthermore, he was no longer in the rank of extraordinary and now has Epic-Tier-1 level physical strength, which should be over 50 Kiloton!Although Jacob didn't have the measuring scale to measure the strength of the Epic Rank, he had a pretty good guess.Behind his mask, his eyes were moving around the busy streets, and he was instantly locked on a small figure within the walking mob. But the moment he looked, the person had already averted its gaze and continued to walk.'Just my imagination, I guess. That person should be someone who has killed quite a lot. Maybe that's why I felt uneasy when he looked at me.' Jacob mused as he felt it was most likely the case, and he was overreacting since no one would be mad enough to pick a fight in the dark city.Even if some lunatic tried anything funny, Jacob was not a helpless lamb.Jacob hailed a taxi at this moment. The taxi driver was a fat goblin; despite wearing a mask, Jacob instantly knew it was a goblin because of that long nose cavity in the mask and its claw-like hand.After Jacob sat on the back seat, the goblin politely asked while looking at him from the front mirror with his astute eyes, "Where to, sir?"Jacob coolly responded, "Alchemy Guild!"

Chapter 228 Magic Smith
﻿Jacob exited the taxi after transferring 44 gold coins to the goblin driver.He walked into a crowded square, and in front of him was a huge skyscraper, probably with over three hundred floors.There were massive letters on this building, 'Alchemy Guild,' and there was the famous sigil of Alchemy Guild, the blazing red flame rising from an eight-legged golden cauldron.In the Dark City, the branches of the Alchemy Guild, like Gunsmith, Apothecary, and Potion Alchemy, were not separated, and they were all combined into a single Alchemy Guild Building.However, this didn't mean it was the true Alchemy Guild, and just like the Zodiac Warrior Alliance, they only had branches in rare plains, not their actual guild.Nevertheless, they were top of Life Professions and reverted by many.Although there was also guidance about these professions in the Zodiac Warrior Alliance Market, they didn't have facilities to practice them like the Alchemy Guild.Furthermore, almost all the rare and precious knowledge, like potion formulas, weapon designs, and many more, were in the hands of the Alchemy Guild.Lastly, the knowledge about the professions like Rune Artificers was also exclusive to the Alchemy Guild, and they didn't even exist in the Rare Plains.What Jacob was here for was actually the Magic Smith profession, related to the Magic Weapon Crafting, which was another exclusive profession of the Alchemy Guild. He had already bought the complete manual from the champion space for 100,000 ZC.What he lacked was the place to practice it and the materials, and unlike the Rune Artificers, the Magic Smith was actually taught in the Rare Plains, but it was not for anyone, and only people with the most talent could be Magic Smith.Jacob had already grasped the basic of Magic Weapon Crafting, and he knew, like the Rune Artificers, it could also be practiced without magic as long as he had appropriate materials.And he was extremely eager to practice it because the Magic Weapon Crafting was quite a delicate process, just like gunsmithing, and he had already got many ideas he wanted to experiment with.That's why he didn't just remember the contents of the manual, but he wanted to practice them as well and assimilate this knowledge with his own. He knew he could go extremely far in this path, just like gunsmithing.He had already seen magic-type guns in the champion shop, so he knew they could be made, and there might be blueprints of them in this place because the alliance market didn't.That's why he came here, first thing.Once he has achieved his goals and is prepared, he will leave the rare plains without wasting more time. As for other things, they won't interest him as long as they won't align with his goals.The Dark City was the only place that could give him all this without having to worry about others' schemes or getting dragged into some war. The gates of the building were opened, and many people were going in and out in an orderly fashion.Besides the normal membership, the Alchemy Guild here also sells their products and amasses a massive amount of wealth daily.Jacob entered the building like everything and found himself in a large lobby with eighteen different elevators and queues of people in front of every single one of them.Some queues were larger than others, while some were small, and no one dared to make a fuss about waiting.Jacob then spotted a long glass counter in the center of this lobby, where beautiful tall ladies of the demi-human race were guiding the people who had questions.He also joined the queue in front of the cat-ears woman, and it was quickly his turn.The woman with cat ears smiled at Jacob and politely asked, "How may I help you today, Sir?""I want to learn Magic Weapon Crafting," Jacob stated his intentions.'Another one who didn't know his limit.'The cat-ears woman didn't seem to be surprised since she daily dealt with such people who were here to try their luck with the rarest profession in Rare Plains.She smilingly replied, "You need to be Senior Grandmaster Blacksmith, Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith, Senior Grandmaster Mason, Senior Grandmaster Magic Watchsmith, and Senior Grandmaster Weapon Analyst. Do you have your identity proof with you, Sir?"Jacob raised a brow when he heard the requirement just to learn the Magic Weapon Crafting.There was no such knowledge about these requirements in the manual he possessed, and he could easily understand it as well as even craft an intermediate-rank magic weapon as long as he had designed without learning those professions. He was that confident.'What now, if I can't join a Magic Smith ranks, I can't enter the Magic Crafting Workshop…' Jacob mused.But he didn't give any reaction as he merely nodded toward the cat-ears woman and said, "Thank you for your information. Then, where I can take the test to increase my Gunsmith Rank?"'Hmm, he gave up easily. At least he knew his place and accepted it.' She had a somewhat good impression of Jacob now."Please go to Floor-51. The Gunsmith Tests conduct there." She replied."Thank you." Jacob nodded and turned around to leave toward the elevator.He suddenly heard the person standing behind passing a jeering remark."Hah, little shit wanted to become a Magic Smith without even having magic. What a bumpkin." The male voice wasn't loud, but many here were Extraordinaires, so they could easily hear him.Many started snickering under their breath.Jacob pretended as if he didn't hear anything and continued on his way toward the elevator. He really didn't mind since he had once gone through such boisterous remakes when he started his journey from nothing.Thereupon, Jacob entered one of the eighteen elevators and headed toward floor-51.While heading up, Jacob mused, 'I should first reevaluate my Gunsmith Rank and gain a gunsmith workshop before studying the last two encyclopedias, the Universal Magical Materials (Type-1) and Universal Beings [Living & Dead] (Type-1) in my possession.'His lips rose in a cold smile, 'So, what if they won't give me access to the Magic Smith Workshop, there's always someone who is short on money. I just need to find them. There's no time to waste on rules when I can break them!'

Chapter 229 Senior Grandmasters Meeting
﻿On the top floor of the Alchemy Guild's building,Within a lavish meeting room, many dignified figures were sitting around a large rectangular table.They were all wearing sky-blue robes with Alchemy Guild's sigil on their back, and the only difference was they had different badges on their chest. But these badges were also Golden in color.The golden color badge represented only one status in the Alchemy Guild, the Status of a Senior Grandmaster!These badges were of white, gray, yellow, iron, bronze, silver, and golden color. These seven color badges represent seven ranks present in the branches of the Alchemy Guild.Starting from Apprentice Rank and all the way to the Senior Grandmaster Rank.Furthermore, only in the dark city's Alchemy Guild did there exist this many Senior Grandmasters, and they were all the ones who had complete control over their respective departments and floors.The only person absent was the most influential person of them all, the Senior Grandmaster Magic Smith, as he handles all the matters in the Inner Circle of Dark City and seldomly appeared in this place.As for why these influential figures were gathered here at this moment…An old elf with a golden pill badge sitting at the very front of the table solemnly spoke, "Gentlemen, as you might have received the news already, I'll still announce it to make it official."Just half an hour ago, a person with Star ID, Faceless Ancient, passed the test of Grandmaster Gunsmith. Not only that, but he wanted to take the test of a Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith right away!"Please take a look at the information we collected on him. I have sent it to your star watches."Many Senior Grandmasters' faces turned stern when they heard it because there wasn't many Senior Grandmaster present in the entire Rare Plains, and if one did emerge, they will draw the attention of the main Alchemy Guild right away.Because the rank of a Senior Grandmaster represented the very pinnacle of a profession in Rare Plains, and anyone with such a capability could produce unimaginable treasures. Especially a Senior Grandmaster of the Gunsmith Profession.They can produce weapons of mass destruction on a cartographic level scale, and that's why they were highly sought after, even more than a Senior Grandmaster Magic Smith. Because in Gunsmithing, there was only complex technology involved, not complex magic.Lastly, the Alchemy Guild controlled the knowledge of every Senior Grandmaster level profession, and only the most talented personnel in the branch guild could learn them, but only after paying a steep price or earning merit.Yet, now, this unknown person had appeared out of nowhere and declared he had the skills of a Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith. How could these Senior Grandmasters not be alarmed?However, when they looked at the profile made after a background check, they were flabbergasted and their eyes winded in surprise because this person was registered in a Common Plains branch and he was so young they even suspected that he had hacked the star network to put all this information.If they hadn't known it was impossible, they will definitely arrest him."Is it even possible for someone from the common plains to come here all the way despite being so young? Not to mention we are talking about the Dark City here. How did this person appear here, and just who is he?" A Senior Grandmaster with a golden potion vile badge exclaimed."Heh, look at his identity badge, 'Eight-Star Nightmare Knight,' do you still think he can't reach this place?" A Senior Grandmaster with a golden scroll badge snickered.The old elf with a golden pill badge stated solemnly again, "I have personally talked with him, and according to him, he got an inheritance on an abandoned island in the Star Ocean, and that's where his knowledge came from."Even if that's just a cover-up, according to our policy, we can't question anyone as long as they don't break any rules of the guild. Nor can we pry into others' secrets if the person is a fellow guild member."Not to mention he had already acquired the Grandmaster Gunsmith Status in our rank, and he had already used his right to take the test of Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith every decade right now."We have to prepare the test within six hours after he used his chance, and if we delay, you all know the consequences. Lastly, you guys should all forget about scheming against him because he had a blood force of 899,999, and this is the limit of the very best device we had. It could be even higher!""What?!"Some of the Senior Grandmasters' faces turned pale as they quickly threw all the strange thoughts in their mind after they heard about the 'inheritance' part.They were not spooked about him being an Eight-Star Nightmare Knight. Then they were spooked after hearing about his blood force.Because blood force represents another thing among the alchemists, it represents the potential of next-level evolution!The easiest way to increase one strength or rank was to raise the blood force, and the alchemy guild naturally had more than enough ways to make an extraordinary bloodline epic by raising the blood force.However, they were all precious to the extreme, and why would they waste such precious resources on old men like them who had already exhausted their potential and long past their primes?On the other hand, this Faceless Ancient was still too young, and it was quite clear that he was extremely talented in the technology department. If his blood force is over 900,000, then the main guild won't mind paying a small price to raise his potential even further and take him to the Epic Plains! This means if they offended him, they might be too pitiful to regret it later, and if they form a good relationship with him, then they will naturally reap the benefits.Even if they won't get any physical benefits, just having the friendship of someone in the epic plains was more than enough.So, their attitude instantly changed.The old elf with a golden pill badge merely snickered as he knew more than enough was going through those old schemer's brains.He then looked toward another female three seats away from him. She was extremely alluring and emitted a mature charm. She also wore the golden badge with the gunsmith sigil on her big meaty chest.Likewise, she was the only Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith present in the Dark City, Golden Elf Rita.He smiled amiably and said, "Miss Rita, according to the rule, you have to be the invigilator of the test, and you may choose any theme you see fit. What do you think?"Rita had this cold and aloof air around her, but even she was shaken by the newcomer's potential as he looked at the profile with great interest.Her cherry lips parted, and a melodious voice heard in the meeting room, "Then, I won't be holding back!"A peculiar light shone in Rita's beautiful eyes as she zoomed at those icy cold amber eyes revealed behind the mask in the picture attached with the file!

Chapter 230 Senior Grandmaster Gunsmith Test (1)
 ﻿On the 55th floor,Jacob was waiting in a luxurious room.It's been five hours since he had passed the Grandmaster Gunsmith test without breaking a sweat.Actually, he wanted to apply for the Elder Grandmaster Gunsmith Rank test directly, but when he discovered from a loss mouth participant that there wasn't even a single Elder Grandmaster present of any profession in the entire rare plains, he decided against it.So, he applied for the Senior Grandmaster Rank test, but to his disappointment, it also can't be done without being a Grandmaster Rank first.But this didn't stop him from applying, and after paying the test fee of 100,000 gold coins, he successfully passed the test on his very first try, making the invigilator dumbstruck.After that, an old elf approached him, who was a Senior Grandmaster Pill Alchemist, started to poke around his past.Jacob knew the fact that he being from the common plains, couldn't be hidden forever, and he didn't plan on hiding it either. He simply made up a story and to quench the old elf's curiosity.He had already known about the rules of the Alchemy Guild, so he wasn't in any kind of danger, neither they could pose any danger to him even if they wanted to.So, after the discussion with the old elf, he directly used his chance to apply for the Senior Grandmaster Rank. But if he failed, he won't get any chance at it again for another ten years. This was a rule which everyone had to follow.But Jacob knew he was more than capable of passing the test beyond the rank of Elder Grandmaster.Still, the Senior Grandmaster title was enough to earn him a respectable status in the whole Alchemy Guild in the Dark City or anywhere in the rare plains, as a matter of fact.So, he settled with it. He had already drawn some attention to himself after revealing he was from the common plains as well as his blood force was also measured when he took the Grandmaster Rank test to see his talent and actual age.He even suspected they might have already known about the commotion he caused in the Freedom Rare Plains when he escaped by pinning the blame on the Killer Skull Society.But according to Star News, the Freedom Rare Plains are completely occupied with the all-out war with the Wild Nation at the moment, so they might not be free enough to notice him in the dark city right in the middle of Magic Beast Forest.Nevertheless, as long as he was in the Rare Plains, Jacob wasn't afraid of getting scheme against, especially in the Dark City.Furthermore, the status of a Senior Grandmaster means he would have access to the organization's storage facilities and can buy anything as long as he can pay for it.He had already joined their private server as a Grandmaster and earned another identity badge with 100 ZC for passing the test.As for any mission application like the alliance, he didn't get any. He mused it might only be available for permanent members.Whichever the case was, he was satisfied with where things were going right now.At this moment, Jacob's eyes sprang open when he heard footsteps approaching the door. Thereupon a light knock rang on the door.He coldly said, "It's open."A Gnome appeared wearing a bronze gunsmith sigil on his chest, and he respectfully bowed before Jacob before he stated, "Sir Grandmaster, the Branch Master has summoned you."Jacob naturally knew just who this Gnome was referring to as 'Branch Master.'Any Senior Grandmaster will have the title of Branch Master, and they also oversee their respective floors. Floor 51st to 55th belonged to the Gunsmith Branch.There was only a single Senior Grandmaster of this Branch as well, and she controlled the entire five floors alone.So, Jacob was quite vigilant of her since she might be some petty person who was too absorbed in used to authority that she might feel threatened by a newcomer like Jacob.Still, he had to go since this exam would be personally conducted by her, and it was also in her hand to decide the theme of this test."Lead the way." Jacob coolly stated as he stood up.The Gnome didn't delay and quickly started to lead the way, he had already got wind of this person's status and what he was going to do, so he was extremely careful not to offend him.Soon, they reached a big hallway, and at the end of this hallway was a large metal door.The Gnome stopped right at the entrance of this hallway as he respectfully said, "Sir Grandmaster, I can't go any further. This is the private workshop of Senior Grandmaster Lady Rita. Please go ahead."Jacob dismissively nodded and walked toward the doors.However, when he was only a meter away, the metal door started to open automatically, revealing a large workshop filled with all kinds of gunsmithing equipment and high-tech machines.Jacob's eyes instantly glowed when he saw all those familiar machines. A hint of reminiscing flashed in his eyes, 'Although this place is not at the level of my lab at my very peak, it's already better than the one when I first joined that prick's company.'While indulging in his bitter yet precious memories, Jacob didn't pay much attention to those five figures standing on the platform at the end of this workshop.Rita was closely watching Jacob with her scrutinous eyes and couldn't help but narrow them slightly. He simply didn't even look at her graceful face or mesmerized by her elvish charm.On the contrary, he was admiring those soulless machines around him, completely ignoring the five Senior Grandmasters as if they were just extras.Lastly, he was still wearing his black mask, which was a blunt disrespect toward them.The old elf also noticed Jacob's disrespectful conduct and his masked face. He couldn't help but smile wryly as he remembered the exact words when he asked Jacob to take off his mask, which left him speechless and without any refute.Jacob cold stated at that time, 'According to the Dark City Rule Number 29: As long as the 'Guest' or 'Noble' does not willingly reveal their facial features, no one can force them to reveal it.'Not even the three hegemonies!'
