Chapter 301 Meeting With Dark Earl (2)
﻿Within a lavish dining hall, a huge table filled with all kinds of dishes and beverages was meticulously arranged.Hallberg, followed by Jacob, and the two giants entered the hall, followed by some masked maidservants.Every servant working within the castle wasn't allowed to reveal his/her face, nor were they allowed to talk with anyone outside the dark castle without the Dark Earl's permission.This was done to make sure no one had any inside information on the City Administrator, and the Dark Rose made sure of it.The Dark City puts the safety of its own nobles first, as well as guards the secrets known by these nobles. Especially a City Administrator, who has the most knowledge about the Dark City and some secrets that Dark Nobles won't know unless they have City Administrator Authority.Jacob looked at the table full of all kinds of meat, and the aromas emitting from them were quite appetizing. He could also tell all that meat belonged to Extraodianry-Tier-6 magic beasts and was made with at least intermediate type-1 ingredients.As for those beverages, their intoxicating scent was evidence of their being intermediate-type-1 quality at least.He had to admit, Hallberg really meant it when he said he was going to hold a feast, and this feast was the best beast anyone could get in the Rare Plains or even in the Dark City.With Hallberg's amiable attitude up till now, Jacob felt this guy might be sincere about meeting him.But he knew things could turn ugly within a moment, especially when he still had no idea why Hallberg had contacted him and even invited him into the noble circle, and those two giants could be seen as his bodyguards. So, it was quite clear Hallberg was also quite careful of him, especially with his current reputation."Trust me, Jack, this meat is the best I could arrange in haste. If you had told me a day before your arrival, I could've done more." Hallberg sighed ruefully.But his made the Giants' eyes spasmed while Jacob gave him a side eye and said, "Then I'm glad I didn't.""Hahaha, so you do have humor, huh?" Hallberg chuckled as he pointed Jacob to his seat right beside his main seat, "Please.""Thank you." Jacob nodded before he sat down, and Hallberg sat right beside him.The two giants sat on the right and left; Stone Hammer sat close to Jacob, while Water Wave was close to Hallberg.Jacob didn't mind those two vigilant gazes, and he thought of something and said to Hallberg, "I prepared a gift for you. Do you mind if I take it out?"Since Hallberg was being so considerate and showing him respect despite his superior status and background, he didn't want to be seen as someone with a lack of respect. He liked to treat people as they treated him.Of course, things would have been different if he had ulterior motives. Especially in Hallberg's case, he wanted to buy something from him. But he was treating him like a guest and even holding this luxurious feast, so he would be slapping the guy in the face by bringing up his purpose.Lastly, Jacob wanted to see something in the sham of this gift.The two giants' eyes flashed in wariness as they looked at Hallberg with meaningful looks.When they heard the same Faceless Ancient who was the person behind the massacre over eight days ago were coming here to meet with Hallberg, their first reaction was this was an insane idea. Hallberg was taking a huge risk by inviting a tiger into his house.Even they weren't sure if they could survive the siege of over five hundred trained warriors. But Jacob did, and he even killed them all. In the end, Hallberg was adamant about meeting with Jacob since he had his own reasons, so he asked them to stay as well.In the end, they agreed, but they wanted to confiscate Jacob's items, especially if he had a space ring, since it would be too dangerous to allow him to keep it.However, Hallberg rejected this idea as he knew this would be rude to Jacob, and he might not even agree to it and made Jacob even more vigilant, which he didn't want.Although it was dangerous to let Jacob keeps his stuff, Hallberg knew if Jacob wanted to act, he might not even need anything.Those over five hundred deaths and Jacob coming here without seeming to be mortally wounded was quite clear that among the living, he was probably the most powerful person in the rare plains at this moment.So, it didn't matter if they took his space ring or not.It would be a lie to say that Hallberg wasn't fearful of Jacob. But he has thoroughly studied this mysterious man called Faceless Ancient, and he found that he never acted against anyone unless they provoked him first.Or he wasn't foolish enough to invite him here if he thought that Jacob was a bloodthirsty killer who killed as he pleased.Like everyone else, he also thought when he called him that Jacob would be wounded and might not even agree to meet him until his wounds healed.But to his astonishment, Jacob agreed to his meeting in ten days, which could only mean he was most likely recovered from that battle.So, it didn't matter if he was wounded or not since he was fine after that kind of massacre. This means he had the means to recover fast and preserve his life.After meeting with Jacob, Hallberg was even more sure that Jacob wasn't as his image had been portrayed by those events around him.Although he was arrogant, he showed appropriate manners when he needed to, and his arrogance came with his strength.eαglesnᴏνel If those two giants did not feel threatened and apprehensive by Jacob's achievement, they would've never behaved like well manner nobles.The giants were arrogant by nature, and they only respected strength. Jacob has strength, so they were not taking any inappropriate action that could offend him despite the fact that they have their reasons not to trust or even hold a grudge against him.Now that he brings up this gift, they feel alarmed but don't jump the guns and look at Hallberg since it was his call."Let's see it." Hallberg smiled and nodded as he allowed it.In his eyes, Jacob didn't need to seek his permission to bring something out, but he did, which mean Jacob knew what they all felt about him and took those feeling into consideration.It was enough to prove that he wasn't just a killer. As an alchemist himself, Hallberg knew how a mind of an alchemist works, and they only do things logically, not driven by killing intent.Jacob's eyes flashed with a peculiar glint before he nodded and flipped his hand with a 'space ring' on his middle finger.The next moment, a two feet gray disc appeared in his hand covered in a silver sheen, and it was half an inch thick like it was an ordinary disc.But it actually wasn't because this was one of the two discs Jacob found from the first two legendary descendant mutants he killed.Although Jacob was sure those guys were from the killer skull society. He just wanted to make sure that someone else wasn't involved, especially after today's assassination attempt right outside the Dark City.Because only Hallberg knew he was going to come back to Dark City, and he hoped it was all just a big coincidence because if it wasn't…

Chapter 302 Meeting With Dark Earl (3)
﻿Looking at the gray disc in Jacob's hand, the two giants frowned with unkind expressions since they found that disc extremely ordinary.But they didn't comment because, with Jacob's current status, they didn't think he would bring out such an insulting gift for the Dark Earl.Furthermore, a magic treasure's true worth could only be found when it was channeled with magic energy. Some magic treasures could appear extremely ordinary, and only a true alchemist could tell them apart with their discreet eyes.As for Stone Hammer and Water Wave, they were not alchemists like Jacob and Hallberg, so they thought it was some kind of extraordinary treasure with special functions, and Hallberg might know what it was.However, what they heard next made them astonished.Hallberg looked at the disc curiously before he looked at Jacob and asked amusingly, "What kind of treasure is this?"Jacob was looking at Hallberg's eyes like a hawk all time as well as the giants' reactions, and as long as these guys were at the terrifying level of hiding their true expression and controlling their eyes on a whim, he knew these three had no idea what this disc was.'So, it was just the killer skull society then. Or they might be involved and had never even seen this disc before. Or I'm simply thinking too much, and the society may be laying in wait outside the Dark City just in case I come back, and it has nothing to do with the dark city or the dark earl…' Jacob thought as over half of his doubts related to his assassination about the Dark Earl vanished.Still, it was a lost cause; unless he could read their minds or tell them about the assassins, he would not find anything this way.Nevertheless, he decided to let it go for now as he should be focused on the main purpose he was for. Once he got what he needed, he would be long gone from the rare plains, leaving everything behind.Furthermore, taking this disc out has another purpose. Jacob was curious about this thing himself, and he tried activating it, but there wasn't any switch or activation sequence. So, he knew this disc was fueled by magic energy, which was quite frustrating.Still, since he had two of them and he couldn't seem to use them yet, he decided to show one to Hallberg as he heard he was also an alchemist and a very good one at that.But he also seemed not to have seen it before he took it out."This is a special treasure that can help you take flight in the sky as long as you pour your magic power into it. As for its other functions, I'll let you explore them on your own. Sometimes mysteries made things more attractive." Jacob impassively stated as he put the disc in front of Hallberg."What? Such treasure exists in rare plains?" Hallberg's eyes visibly twinkled when he heard about this fascinating treasure.It was quite clear he really didn't know about this disc, not to mention it was capable of taking flight. The Rare Plains didn't have aircraft despite having cars which were quite strange in Jacob's mind.But he didn't put much thought into it as it wasn't his problem since he could move between the places just fine.But these discs were quite novel since they could make people fly with magic power, and they could be very handy. Alas, Jacob couldn't enjoy this luxury right now since he had the machine but no fuel to run it, which was quite frustrating sometimes.Even those giants look quite intrigued by the description of this ordinary-looking disc."Just its function of flight is enough to make it a unique treasure in the Rare Plains, so Jack, I won't reject this gift. But it's too precious, so don't hold back if you need anything from me." Hallberg happily stated as he picked up the disc, and he was astounded when he found just how lightweight it was."Alright, let's eat first before I try it out. I can't wait." Hallberg stowed it away, and Jacob didn't reject his arrangement, and he felt it was worth trading that one disc if he could get materials from Hallberg.The mask maidservants were waiting for Hallberg's exact words and started to serve.All of a sudden, everyone looked at Jacob, who was concealing his appearance even more meticulously than Hallberg.Jacob sensed the atmosphere as it was quite clear if he wanted to eat, he had to reveal his face, but he didn't do so just because he was under the spot. He turned his face toward Hallberg and said meaningfully, "Shall we?"Hallberg wasn't a fool, as he knew what Jacob was implying. He was clearly asking him to remove his mask as well, which was quite audacious of him.Still, Jacob wasn't someone who was going to hesitate when his words held some authority."Heh, of course, or do you think I'm going to watch you guys enjoy those precious ales?" Hallberg sneered jollily before he removed his mask, revealing his beard face, which was as Jacob imagined it to be.Jacob then didn't chuckle slightly before the mask under his hood vanished, and he took off his hood as well, revealing his maimed face. Furthermore, his hair was blond, and his ears were pointy.Jacob had thought that he might have to show his face in this place, and the occasion might be one where he could not reject it unless he wanted to make things grim between the Dark Earl and himself.So, he prepared his Golden Elf disguise just in case. The only unexpected touch was his charred left eye socket which made his handsome face less attractive and scarier, something he appreciates at any time.Just as he thought, those three were quite startled seeing the mysterious Faceless Ancient was an elf which shouldn't be possible since a golden elf could never be this powerful.So, they all thought he had a terrifying secret. As for his maimed eye, they thought less of it, as scars among warriors were considered akin to honorable symbols."Your eyes, it's not permanent, right?" Hallberg couldn't help but ask at this moment."Yes, it was an unfortunate encountered." Jacob coolly replied.A peculiar glint flashed past Hallberg's eyes before he didn't stir that topic anymore and said, "Alright, let's eat!"

Chapter 303 Meeting With Dark Earl (4)
﻿After the short conversation with Hallberg, the meal went without any important topics discussed, and everyone seemed to be enjoying that table of sumptuous delicacies.Jacob, in particular, didn't have such a meal for a while now, and the ale especially made me comment on its unique, intoxicating flavor that he never had tasted before.Accepting his praise, Hallberg revealed that he had brewed this ale himself, and it was kind of his favorite hobby, which was definitely a dwarf thing.However, as time passed, the three hosts were surprised by Jacob's appetite, which seemed endless. Even the Giants couldn't eat so much high-nutrition meat since it would be difficult to digest even with their powerful digested system.Still, the giants were known for their big appetite and most powerful digested system and physiques, yet here they were, looking at Jacob dumbfoundedly.In the end, everyone was speechless as over half of that twenty-meter table filled with all kinds of dishes was cleaned up by Jacob, and they wondered how this guy wasn't exploding."You can really eat," Hallberg commented without holding back his amazement."I must admit, I didn't have such a meal in a very long time, so I hope you don't think little of me." Jacob impassively said as he cleaned his mouth with a napkin despite the fact that he could probably eat far more than just that one table.But Jacob knew they might freak out if they knew he could eat more, so he was satisfied with this much. At least it was far better than eating everything and anything raw. "Hahaha… this is the best comment a host could get from his guest, and I'm really glad I can satisfy your taste buds. Besides, I know we alchemists rarely have enough to time to tend to ourselves, much less enjoy these kinds of meals, so I can relate to your feelings." Hallberg chuckled candidly.The two giants hadn't spoken a word since the start of their meeting with Jacob, as they were silently observing as if they weren't here at all. But they were now starting to feel different about the 'elf' called Faceless Ancient.Jacob merely nodded as he understood the last part about not being able to enjoy a meal with others if someone was obsessed with research.'Once you realized all the work you give away your entire life for was going to vanish with your life, you're starting to realize just what you missed…' Jacob suddenly lamented."Alright, I'm full. Let's go for a walk. I'll show you the Dark Castle as well, for we can try this gift of yours. I can't stop thinking about it. What do you think?" Hallberg excitedly asked.Jacob naturally had no objection as things were going fine with Hallberg, so he decided to let them progress as they were. So he nodded, and they all left the dining hall under Hallberg's lead.Hallberg was walking beside Jacob in the big hallways of the Dark Castle while he showed off the same precious antiques and told history related to those items to Jacob while those two giants followed quietly from behind.Jacob only listened attentively as he didn't know much about the history of this world. Still, he soon lost interest since the so-called history related to those items was all about the Dark City of the Rare Plains, not actually about the world.For some reason, there wasn't any history of this place anywhere which was quite unusual. The only information available was from the beginning of the Freedom Plains, and before that, everything was almost blank.While talking, Hallberg led the group into an open field that had an open battle ring as well as many weapon shelves placed around it."This is my private training ground where I can let loose once in a while whenever I am fed up with my research." Hallberg jokingly introduced.Jacob nodded, "No bad."Hallberg then quickly took out the gray disc as he looked eager to try it. The giants also looked quite interested in that disc which seemed to be capable of flight.Jacob himself wanted to see its functions up close and made some countermeasures if those guys decided to show up again from the air next time. This disc was the only useful thing he had on that group of assassins, and it seemed unique to them since not even the Dark Earl knew about it."So, I just need to pour my magic energy into it?" Hallberg asked.Jacob clearly had no idea if it worked or not. However, he still nodded as it was most likely the case since there wasn't any kind of mechanism on it to start, and his crafter's intuition shouldn't be wrong, especially after he learned magic smiting and had knowledge of Rune Artificer.Hallberg didn't find any falsehood in Jacob's words, and he didn't have any reason to doubt Jacob providing him with false information on the item he had just gifted him away.He was going to use his magic power when Water Wave suddenly stopped him. As she appeared right in front of him and said impassively, "Your Excellency, let me try it first. It should be dangerous to fly, and we still don't know if this thing has a protective function for its user to keep him from falling or its max speed."I don't think Mr. Ancient has any other intention of keeping this information on himself except to give His Excellency some thrill of novel experience. But as your adviser today, I can't allow you to try something this dangerous."So, please just let me test it first, and this way, you will also know how it works and won't face any threat or an accident. What do you think, Mr. Ancient? I mean, not offensive, but I hope you understand Dark Earl is too important for the Dark City, and we can't let some unfortunate accident happen to him?" Water Wave's tone was exempt from any emotion as she looked at Jacob.Jacob looked deeply at the giant woman, and he could feel her vigilance and a faint hostility toward him, and he had this feeling from the start that she held some kind of grudge against him.Still, what she just said makes a lot of sense, and she pointed out really major threats to Hallberg if this disc didn't have those functions.Jacob didn't think about it much since he thought they could easily avoid falling or could balance themselves by using some sort of magic, but it seemed it wasn't the case at all.Jacob was still quite oblivious about how magic energy worked since he didn't have any, and his point of view was different from those who had it. So, it could be understandable if he overlooked these important points.As for Hallberg, he didn't think Jacob would try to harm him, and he also had his own way of protecting himself from falling. More importantly, he won't try to take flight on this disc right away before testing it. He wasn't a fool.But Water Wave still brought it up, which was akin to looking down on his own intellect while also doubting Jacob's kind intention behind this gift.Even Stone Hammer thought this was quite excessive since he also didn't think Jacob would try to do anything to Hallberg after that meal they had as he's been showing proper restraint.Still, Water Wave's points were valid, and he also thinks that Hallberg shouldn't be this trusting to someone who they met just over an hour ago."I don't mind," Jacob replied without many expressions on his face.But deep down, he now started to feel uneasy about giving away this untested treasure to the Dark Earl just to quench his own curiosity and test the other party's intentions.Still, he would do it again if he had to since it was important to know the involvement of the Dark Earl in that assassination despite the result were not what he expected.But Jacob still believed that there wasn't anything wrong with this treasure as they were being used just fine when he picked them up after killing their owners, and he didn't believe they had any chance to do anything to these discs since he killed them instantly.Hallberg, on the other hand, frowned slightly while giving Water Wave an unhappy look as he found this insult toward his guest.Still, he didn't want to berate Water Wave as she was one of his Dark Nobles, but he decided to give her a piece of his mind when they were alone.As for now, he gave her the disc with a stiff expression and said, "You better not break it.""Of course." Water Wave nodded without any emotion in her eyes before she took the disc from Hallberg's hand, "Please step back."After the three got a few feet away, she finally activated it and poured blue magic energy into the disc, and it suddenly shimmered in a blue hue and…!

Chapter 304 Meeting With Dark Earl (5)
﻿After the three got a few feet away, she finally activated it and poured blue magic energy into the disc. It suddenly shimmered in a blue hue, and almost instantly, it started to float in front of Water Wave!The gray disc now shimmered in a blue hue under Water Wave's water element magic energy.Hallberg muttered while looking at the disc with shining eyes, "How fascinating."Water Wave then tried to control it, and she was shocked when she found that just as he willed to move it below with her magic, the disc seemed to react to her thought and shimmered faintly before it slowly descended toward her feet and only stopped when it was only an inch away from her touching the ground.She then couldn't help but glance at Jacob with a strange glint in her eyes, and when she saw he was as dismissive as before, coldness surfaced in her heart."You shouldn't keep Lord Dark Earl waiting." It was Stone Hammer who said coldly at this moment. His words contained a strange type of warning in them while he looked at her meaningfully.'Don't do anything stupid…'This is what he wanted to convey, but it was unknown if Water Wave got it or not.She inhaled sharply before she stepped on the disc, and she was even more astonished when she found that the disc remained completely stable as it didn't even flinch under her weight.Then something fascinating happened, the blue hue on the disc suddenly started to rise and covered Water Wave's feet, and she instantly felt that her feet seemed to have embedded in the disc as she couldn't even flinch them.But it didn't end there as she felt more magic power suddenly start to enter the disc as if it was out of her control, and that blue hue kept rising over her body until it completely encased her within.Under everyone's scrutinous eyes, the moment the blue hue encased her entirely, she suddenly vanished!Jacob, who was watching this, thought grimly, 'So, these things also have stealth function, and even I can't sense her anymore. Moreover, this thing seemed to be extremely precious, and I just gave it away as a gift.'But I can't use it anyway, and it was worth the reconnaissance provided by these guys as well as now Hallberg would think I have a terrifying backing since I can bring out this kind of thing as a mere gift. Things are still in my favor.'The only problem is I just got to know the Killer Skull Society has these kinds of terrifying weapons at their disposal, and I just happened to piss them off enough that they are now unleashing them on me!'The more he thought about how he almost got killed, the more he felt he was still not out of the wood.At this moment, Hallberg couldn't contain his curiosity and yelled, "Alright, I've seen enough, and it's clearly safe. Now hand it over. It's my turn."He was really alarmed by the stealth effect of that disc, and as an alchemist himself, he knew that treasure could probably be rivaled by type-2 treasures. When he thought about how Jacob gave away such a precious gift, he felt even more alarmed by Jacob's unknown means. 'Just who is he, and how the hell can he have this kind of weapon at his disposal? Is he got this from the rumored champion shop, or he found some ancient ruin? He might have a mysterious background that no one is aware of.'Whichever the case is, he's worth having as a friend than an enemy. If he had another this kind of disc, then I'm afraid he's invincible in the rare plains, and maybe this is the secret behind the massacre over a week ago…'The more Hallberg thought this way, the more he felt he was right and felt even more respectful and apprehensive of the man standing beside him.He was now sure that if Jacob wanted him dead, there was nothing that could stop him from doing not even his city's best combatants. So it was meaningless to keep testing him since it might just ruin everything if they got on Jacob's nerves."Why aren't you deactivating the disc?" He frowned when he saw Water Wave still didn't appear despite his command.Stone Hammer felt something amiss when Water Wave still didn't appear, and he looked at Jacob and coldly asked, "Can that thing really be turned off?"Jacob gave him an impassive answer, "Since it can turn on, it can naturally turn off. It's all come down to the person who is riding over it."However, he wasn't sure about this either, but he won't admit it and continued to observe without showing his true intentions.This answer, however, made both Stone Hammer and Hallberg thought of other possibilities, and their expression started to cloud."She dared to bugger off with it?" Hallberg couldn't help but say it out loud with disbelief."No, it's not possible. We both know her. She's a rational person, and besides, if she dared to rob you in broad daylight, the Dark City would not let her off. She will lose everything she accumulated in her entire life for a mere treasure. It's not worth it." Stone Hammer tried to defend Water Wave as he had known her for decades.But when he thought about something, he glanced at Jacob and couldn't help but feel his blood run cold, 'No, no, she won't do it…'Just as he was giving himself a false sense of security, he suddenly felt death looming from his racial battle instinct, but this feeling only lasted for a mere moment before it vanished.Still, his entire body was frozen on the spot despite knowing that terrifying feeling was gone, and this was also evident that he didn't feel wrong at all. He just felt death was imminent, but then it disappeared.But he clearly felt the source of it, and when he shakily turned his head towards it, he was horrified when he saw Jacob was now clenching air with one hand.Jacob's deadly cold voice sounded at this moment as he looked in the air, "Are you seeking death?"

Chapter 305 Meeting With Dark Earl (6)
﻿"Are you seeking death?"Just as Jacob's chilly voice trailed off, he yanked his hand, which was clenching the air, and the next moment, a suffocating shrill rang before Water Wave's figure materialized in everyone's view.The shimmering blue disc under her feet also lost its luster and fell on the ground as well as a short purple sword fell with it.If he hadn't used his 15X acceleration for a moment and reacted fast, she would've stabbed him in the head, which was not something Jacob would take kindly after the event a few hours ago!However, Hallberg nor Stone Hammer paid any attention to the disc as they looked at the Water Wave's pale face as she struggled under Jacob's grip and was on the verge of suffocating to death. She was like a mannequin under Jacob's grip, which was about to lose its head.But Jacob didn't kill her since it would make the matter end. He wanted to know why the hell this woman, who he had never seen before, wanted to take a shot at his life. Not to mention she did it right in front of Hallberg and in the Dark City.It was a huge risk that only a lunatic would take who either had no other choice or held a deep grudge against Jacob.Before she could suffocate and lose consciousness, he waved his hand and threw her in front of Hallberg and Stone Hammer before he coldly said, "You owe me an explanation, Your Excellency."His tone was exempt from any emotion, which sent chills to both Hallberg and Stone Hammer's spines and the scene of Jacob easily taking care of Water Wave and holding her like a little girl under his grip played in their mind again and again.The next moment, Jacob picked up the disc, and without any explanation, he stowed it away. Now he had perfect justification for taking it back since it was used against him, and Hallberg won't be able to object.'This disc's exact rank might not be a type-1. I need to research it more and make more countermeasures. Especially to get rid of that cloaking effect. But this cloaking effect was different from those guys as I was able to sense her killing intent when she was a few feet away from me, and her heartbeat became clearer.'But those guys are too strange as they appeared out of thin air without making any sound or releasing any kind of intent. This might be something to have to do with them being mutants…' Jacob thought grimly as he analyzed the two attacks.In comparison to the assassination attempt earlier today, Water Wave's attempt was too predictable and easy to counter.'Cough *pant* cough…'Water Wave's violent coughing drew Jacob's attention again since it was more important right now to find what drove this woman to try this stunt."Y-you… you… why!?" Hallberg was literally trembling with rage and agitation as if he would explode. He never thought this entire pleasing meeting would be turned nasty because of his side's idiocy.Furthermore, he had some idea about why Water Wave or Stone Hammer held a grudge against Jacob, but he didn't know the specifics of why Water Wave took this kind of drastic action.As Stone Hammer said earlier, Water Wave was a ration person and one of the oldest nobles in the Dark City, and she should know better than anyone that once she crossed a certain line, it was over for her, but she still ended up crossing it anyway.He was usually busy with his research and alchemy, so he paid little attention to these dark nobles' personal affairs. He only knew these two in the Dark Viscount circle personally, while the others never had seen his face.The Rare Plains was never his focus of concern anyway, so he had very little interest or connections with it. Meeting with Jacob was also a matter which was unrelated to the Rare Plains, and he felt he was the only person who was worth it.However, he never expected things would turn this ugly this quickly, and now he lost face as well as credibility in the other party's eyes, and he was furious as well as somewhat relieved.Furious naturally because things turned out like this as he felt betrayed by someone he trusted while relieved because Jacob didn't outright start killing people.Jacob gave him face and a chance by sparing Water Wave, and this also made him even more humiliated as the Dark Earl of the Dark City.Water Wave slowly gained some color on her face, but the fear of almost kissing death was evident in her eyes, "I-I… I don't remember…" A hint of bewilderment flashed past her eyes at this moment as if she was in complete disbelief."You fool!" Hallberg was livid and almost kicked her."I know why she did it." It was Stone Hammer who spoke with a rueful expression, "You should use giants are very protective of our brethren. Especially our family or spouse. A Giant can hold a grudge upon his tribe men's death, and a blood feud is forged when a family member or a spouse is killed. "Over a week ago, when over five hundred people died by Faceless Ancient, there was also a Universal Mercenary giant named Fire Cannon, who was killed as well. He was Water Wave suppose, so she did what she did for revenge driven by her natural instincts."Hallberg almost had a stroke when he heard the truth, "And you're only telling me about this important matter right now?!"Stone Hammer bitterly lowered his head, "She assured me she wouldn't do anything out of the line as long as that man was Lord Hallberg's guest, and she also wanted to see herself if revenge was possible or not. Even I didn't expect her to take action right when she got the chance.""You both! Get out of my face!" Hallberg was too furious even to stand still as his entire face was red with anger, "Dark Rose, punish Dark Viscount Water Wave for her current treasonous action according to Dark City law. You have full authority!""NO! I didn't do it because I want! I was controlled by that evil treasure!" Water Wave was ashen as she finally snapped out of her stupor while she tried to defend herself with a horrified expression.She then looked at Jacob, who was just listening from the side as a bystander, and madness filled with hatred shone in her eyes as she pointed her finger at Jacob and menacingly roared, "H-him! It's his scheme to get rid of me and put you in a difficult position so he could easily manipulate you! You have to believe me, Stone Hammer. I would never do such a foolish thing!"A hint of hesitation flashed past Stone Hammer's eyes as he looked deep into Water Wave's eyes, and he didn't find them the eyes of someone who was lying. As a Giant, he knew despite their hot temper and arrogance, they were not idiots.It was given that some of them were driven by pure emotions and didn't back down from a challenge, but Water Wave wasn't one of them as she was ration, and he was also not someone who would seek death just for the small grudge of Jacob killing giants.He knew Jacob was stronger than him, and seeking trouble with him was akin to throwing his life. It was even more clear after he took out such a treasure like that disc.But Water Wave's actions were completely different from her usually calm and collective character."Bang…"Before Stone Hammer could even pacify his inner struggle, he was shocked by Hallberg when he threw a vicious kick right on Water Wave's face, and it wasn't just a normal kick but a kick from someone at the extraordinary tier-6 being.She was already drained out of her mana as well as in a weakened state because of Jacob's manhandling her, so she couldn't even react as she was sent flying and smacked into a wall, raising a cloud of dust.Hallberg's eyes were colder than ice as he uttered while looking at the dusty area where Water Wave had just landed, "Do you think I'm some sort of pushover just because I never interfere with you guys' businesses?"Today, you humiliate me and try to harm my guest, and not only you're not admitting it. You even try to twist reasons?" He then looked at Stone Hammer, stunned by this sudden outburst of Hallberg, and said in an equally cold tone, "Take her away to the castle jail. She will be judged by Dark Rose there. If you do anything silly, you'll see more of me. Now get the hell out of my face."Stone Hammer, a giant at this moment, felt fear from a Dwarf and didn't dare even to speak a word as he walked toward Water Wave, who had a bloody face and her nose was broken, and she had lost consciousness.Hallberg ignored the pair and looked at Jacob, who hadn't interfered with him from the start. He sighed ruefully before he bowed his head, "I apologize!"

Chapter 306 A Dark Mission Offer
﻿Jacob looked at Hallberg, who was bowing his head in apology. He knew with Hallberg's current status; it was quite a big deal for him to lower his head in front of him."Since no harm was done, and His Excellency has already taken care of the matter, let's consider it over." He stated impassively.Although he got to know why Water Wave tried to take a shot at his life, the entire thing was filled with ambiguity. Especially the part when she said it was the disc that intensified her emotions and made her do it.If Jacob had known the disc's entire functions, he would've scoffed at her accusation. But the thing is, he had no idea what kind of functions this disc had, and he really doubted that it might have some kind of effect on Water Wave's brain. Or the Killer Skull Society might have some way to control it remotely.Whatever the case was, Jacob needed to test this thing thoroughly, and he was even glad that Water Wave was the one who tried it first, not Hallberg.Because if the disc really can mess up with the brain, then he won't be able to explain himself if Hallberg was the one who lost his mind. Still, he will not be talking that disc out anymore, not until he knows its full deal or if it was absolutely necessary.Hallberg looked at Jacob and sighed again with a hint of complication, "You are not what you appeared to be. Let's go. We should have a serious conversation now."Jacob nodded in agreement, and he knew it was time to talk business after what had happened. He wasn't in the mood to have a tour around, nor was Hallberg.Hallberg, in a sullen mood, led Jacob to another luxurious hall where another table was filled with beverages waiting for them. It was clearly prepared beforehand.Hallberg sat on the seat and instantly poured himself a glass of purple color ale and gulped it down without even a second delay."Sigh…" He exhaled sharply before he looked at Jacob, who was sitting in front of him without moving."That really ruins the mood, huh?" Hallberg bitterly lamented before he said, "So, why were you looking for me? If there's anything I can do to make amends, I won't hold back."Jacob didn't get to the point; instead, he replied ambiguously, "As I said before, no harm was done. I shouldn't have brought that thing out despite knowing the people of Rare Plains weren't ready for it."Anyway, I can see Your Excellency is more interested in me than I am in you. I hope you can satisfy my curiosity about why did you give me this chance despite knowing what I'm capable of."Like right now, you appeared to want my forgiveness more than anything. I would like to know what you seek from me so we can move on with our conversation without being wary of each other intentions."Jacob plainly laid it down as he didn't think there was any need to beat around the bush anymore. He had an advantage over Hallberg, which he clearly wasn't expecting, but it didn't mean he won't use it just because he might be at fault.Jacob had learned the hard way about the art of negotiation, and kindness or remorse has no place in it.Hallberg chuckled wryly as he said, "I guess there's no point in hiding it anyway. I was interested in you first because of your 1-star privilege, which led me to believe that you were the mysterious champion of Rare Plains Trial."But it was only a fleeting interest until you abruptly became the Alchemy Guild Leader, which was quite unexpected given the old man Braylon's astute personality."However, you then abruptly vanished for almost two years, and when you appeared again, you caused another huge event over a week ago. Trust me what you did; I don't think anyone in my position didn't want to befriend you or at least know if you are an enemy or friend." Jacob nodded in understanding as he would've done the same if he was in Hallberg's position, but it was not this simple, not by a long shot, because Hallberg was not just anyone. He was the Dark Earl of the Dark City!"Then what do you think? Am I an enemy or friend?" Jacob asked in a subtle tone.Hallberg looked deeply into Jacob's impassive eyes before shaking his head, "I don't know if you're a friend or not, but I do know you won't become an enemy if I don't give you a good reason for it."Jacob nodded without denying Hallberg's claim and said sharply, "That's right. So, tell me the real reason you want me here?"Hallberg was startled before he wryly asked, "It's not enough?"Jacob shook his head, "It's a good judgement of character, not a reason. If you know I don't have a reason to be your enemy, you could've just stayed as far away from me, and there's no reason to invite me into your house, which is a risk, not inquisitiveness."Hallberg's eyes shimmered with a sharp glint as he drank another glass of ale and laughed suddenly, "You know, now that I think about it after meeting you, it was a right decision to invite you here. Alright, I'll give it to you straight; I want to issue a Dark Mission to you."Jacob cocked an eyebrow as it was somewhat unexpected, "What kind of Dark Mission? Since you know my capabilities, you won't give me something trivial."Hallberg nodded, and without hiding it further, he revealed, "It's actually an escort mission, and the reward will be the Dark Baron Title and 1 Million ZC."Jacob's eyes narrowed as the rewards were quite enticing that even he felt compelled. Just the title of the Dark Baron was enough to make almost all the people in the dark city crazy.However, this will also make this escort mission just as dangerous as well."Continue," Jacob stated impassively, as he still wanted to know the details before he would reject or accept it.Hallberg revealed with a hint of a smile, "The Escort Mission is actually escorting me to the Epic Plains!"

Chapter 307 A Trial By Fire
﻿Jacob remained silent for a moment after he heard the content of this Dark Mission while he looked at Hallberg with a peculiar glint in his eyes."You want me to escort you to the Epic Plains? Is Dark City running out of manpower?" Jacob asked impassively.But his tone was pretty much disdainful because, in his opinion, Hallberg was demanding something absurd from him. Not to mention escorting Hallberg out of the Rare Plains, he didn't dare to leave without being absolutely careful himself.Unlike the Rare Plains, where the power level was bonded by a bottleneck, the Star Ocean wasn't like that at all. He had seen the map to the epic plains, and he knew it would take him about three to five years to reach it if he didn't encounter any danger or somehow lost his way.Hallberg clearly knew what Jacob meant by those words, and he didn't seem flustered at all and said, "I know you probably think this is some kind of a joke since a Dark Earl like didn't need an outsider to be my escort. But hear me out first, and then you can reject me all the same. If a request is not a command, you have full right to accept it or reject it."Jacob thought for a moment before he nodded, "I understand."Hallberg then didn't delay and speak, "The thing is, like the three hegemonies, the Dark City has its own customs, and trust me when I say these customs are absolute and far stricter than the three hegemonies."One of these customs is the process of ascending a plain. You could take it as a trial by fire. If an official Dark City member wanted to leave a Dark City in a lower plain and enter a higher-level plain's Dark City, they had to do it according to the Dark City customs unless they wanted to get expelled from the Dark City."Jacob finally showed a hint of interest as the Dark City was quite mysterious, and it was the first time hearing about its customs. Besides, by Hallberg's solemn expression, Jacob knew he wasn't joking."How did Dark City select its official members?" He couldn't help but inquire.Previously, Jacob thought that the Dark Nobles were the official members of the Dark City, but it clearly wasn't the case, as the Dark City gave those titles to anyone who cleared Dark Missions. There was no restriction on the person's affiliations.Unlike the three hegemonies who didn't allow their official members to join the ranks of the other hegemonies' official members, the Dark City seemed to have its own unique system.That's why he asked Hallberg, who seemed to be an official member, since it was a rare chance. But Hallberg's reply was not what he was expecting."Please forgive me. I can't reveal this information to you. All I can comment on this topic is the Dark Cities demand absolute loyalty from its members." Hallberg ambiguously stated.Jacob frowned ever so slightly, but he didn't push the matter further since it seemed to be some kind of core secret of the Dark City.Hallberg also didn't want to dwell on its topic and continued about that trial of his, "Anyway, as I was saying to leave a lower plain Dark City, an official member needed to clear certain conditions which I also can't reveal to you."After those conditions were complete, we can proceed with our journey toward the higher plains, which is the actual trial by fire. In which we can only select one escort from the same plain we want to leave."If you think that this system can easily be cheated since no one can monitor us, then you couldn't be too wrong. We are required to wear our star watches all the time, and Dark Rose will monitor the entire thing once we call it the start of the mission."The chosen escort will also have to sign a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and be part of the same kind of monitoring. If anyone is caught cheating, then the escort will be banned from entering any Dark City while the trial taker will suffer a fate worse than death."Jacob finally showed a clear frown on his face as this entire thing was too absurd for him, especially the conditions inflicted on both parties involved in this absurd trial of fire thing."Is it worth taking all this risk just to be part of an organization?" He couldn't help but question with a cold tone.Jacob's impression of the Dark City greatly plummeted after he heard about this trial and just how harsh they were toward their own members, who probably served them faithfully for decades. Especially someone like Hallberg, who would leave all this luxury behind to go to the Epic Plains. Yet not only he has to take the risk of going there by himself, but he also had to be under constant monitoring.Hallberg suddenly smiled in a decisive manner as he nodded without hesitation, "If you're a member of the Dark City, then you will know this small trial is nothing in front of what you can gain. It's absolutely worth it!"Jacob's frown deepened as there wasn't any hint of falsehood in Hallberg's words or his expression.Hallberg still wasn't done as he continued, "Look, the reward I promised you are the one I will give you personally, not the rewards you will get from the Dark City."Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he heard this and said, "So you can make anyone Dark Baron, and what kind of rewards are we talking about?""I can naturally bestow Dark Baron title once I reach the Epic Plains, and the 1 million ZC will be your advance payment. As for the reward you will get from the Dark City, I can only say they will be as lavish as the rewards you got from the Champion Shop!" Hallberg said matter-of-factly.Jacob finally fell into silence at this moment when the champion shop was brought up. He knew better than anyone just what kind of status the Champion Shop represented. That shop has anything that could exist in a plain which makes it alluring to anyone.'If he's telling the truth, then I can get many things right off the bat after I entered the Epic Plains. I had to go into the epic plains either with him or without him, and I would be at the bottom of the epic plains once I got there.'So, if I take this risk, I can change my situation around…' Jacob thought as he couldn't ignore rewards akin to the champion shop, especially if this shop's content were from the epic plains."So, are you in or out? Because trust me, you would want to leave this place after you know what's coming." Hallberg smilingly asked as he knew he almost convinced Jacob by his subtle silence, so he decided to reveal his final trump card.Jacob squinted his eyes as he asked, "What's coming?"Hallberg's expression went dark as he gloomily said three words, "The Dark Being!"

Chapter 308 A Hired Gun
﻿Jacob was confused about this ambiguous reply, "I don't understand what you're hinting at."The Dark Beings could be said to be on the other side from where the Dark City was, and he knew about their successful conquest of the Freedom Plains. So, Hallberg bringing them up clearly didn't make sense in Jacob's mind.Furthermore, Hallberg seemed to be appeared somewhat scared, which was quite strange since Dark City shouldn't be afraid of Dark Beings because they have a huge geographical advantage and they normally aren't afraid of anyone.Hallberg then explained, "What I want to say is the Dark Being's King, the Lich King, has pointed his sword toward the Magic Beast Forest after his conquest of the Freedom Plains."Not only that, but he deliberately called out that he would eradicate all the living beings on the Rare Plains, including the ones hiding in the Dark City, which is not normal at all."The Lich King seemed to have gone mad after you claimed the win for the life faction from right under his nose. As for a reason for his losing it, according to the hierarchy of the dark begins, this kind of failure would normally result in the incompetent ruler's death."So, he could've already foreseen his impending doom when the reinforcement from both sides will come in over a year from now. He will be replaced by another dark being."However, he seemed to be not wanted to accept it, so he probably decided to try one last time to regain his position and his life." Hallberg's expression was grave as he revealed. Jacob's eyes narrowed, "Don't tell me if he eradicates all the life and conquers the entire Rare Plains, he'll escape from his punishment and will keep his position? Is that what this is all about?"Hallberg shook his head, "Normally, he should've able to preserve his life after he claimed the entire freedom plains for the Dark Faction, and it was also seemed to be the case until a few days ago when he suddenly decided to move his armies in this direction despite knowing this entire march would cost him too much yet he did it anyway which is akin to throwing away his life again which he fought so hard to earn back."So, you're suspecting that there's some other purpose in him doing all this? And his specifically calling for the Dark City is also not normal, right?" Jacob quickly grasped at the situation.Hallberg nodded in affirmative, "Yes, which is why it made the mad Lich King even more terrifying. Many of the people in the Dark City have already started to leave the Dark City since they're thinking the target of the Lich King this time is specifically the Dark City because he called out for it."Jacob frowned slightly, "Can Dark City not do anything about the Dark Beings? You guys are clearly an advantage here. Furthermore, won't you suffer in repercussions for abandoning the Dark City as its current ruler?"Jacob quickly understood that Hallberg was clearly trying to desert the Rare Plains because of the Dark Beings, and he wasn't shocked by it or had any opinion since he would do the same if he encountered something he couldn't handle.Nevertheless, he was curious about the Dark City's viewpoint on this. Hallberg's previous words also made it clear that they might've given up on the freedom plains to quench the Lich King's wrath.This means they let that slaughter happen so that they could avoid confrontation with the dark beings. This also made Jacob remove the slight bit of remorse he had for those people. He has done nothing wrong by lifting the barrier over them. They can only blame the cruel world they were born in.Hallberg suddenly smiled, which seemed somewhat cold, "Let me worry about the matters of Dark City. So, I'll ask you again, are you willing to escort me out the rare plains?"Jacob looked at Hallberg's current expression. He could tell he was really someone who only cared about himself, so he didn't question the matter related to the dark city or how he was going to handle it since it really wasn't any of his concern.Instead, now he has a choice of his own to make.In truth, Jacob didn't care about the Dark Being since he knew they couldn't do anything to him as long as he wanted to run. Even in the direct confrontation, he was confident in killing the lich king.But the thing was, the Dark Beings' real strength lies in their numbers and their undead bodies. He now had all the information on the Dark Beings which he bought from the champion shop.They were too difficult to deal with as they seemed only to have one weakness while they had terrifying advantages. He was even spectacle about it and finally understood just why those guys seemed to be in a dominating position despite losing their advantage of number.Because the Dark Being didn't seem to bother by the number at all; heck, they didn't even know the concept of low in number. Because dark beings can turn living in the dark begins like zombies.While a Lich or Wight can straight up turn dead into their own undead puppets, that's why the Dark Beings were never afraid of warfare; they were simply born for it!Jacob then finally speaks, "I can be your hired gun. But I can't leave the Rare Plains until I complete some of my own matters."Hallberg's eyes glow in ecstasy as he says, "What matters? Just tell me, and I'll help you out. We still have two or three months before those guys will be upon us."Jacob nodded as he wanted to hear exactly this thing, "Actually, my purpose of looking for you was also the same exact thing. I'm looking for some materials, and if you have them, then I don't mind leaving after one month from now."Hallberg appeared even more excited as he agreed without hesitation, "Tell me, what do you need?"Jacob also didn't shy away as he stated the three remaining materials he needed for the ritual.Hallberg appeared surprised before he said, "Quite rare materials you're looking for, not to mention peculiar. If you want just White Assassin Parasite Bug's Blood, then you can take it as much as you want."I also have 1000-year-old Nightmare Lilly. However, I only have one nine-star Night Salve's Poison Magic Core and should have three eight-star magic cores. Night Salve's poison magic core is quite a good ingredient to make advanced type-1 antidote and detoxifying pills."So, it's instantly bought whenever it appears and even more quickly used in an alchemist's hand. But I can look for them. Give me a day, and I'll tell you about it." Hallberg truthfully replied.Jacob's eyes shimmered in elation since almost all the materials were available right this instant which was more than what he was hoping for. So, he agreed without hesitation, "Alright, I'll wait for one day!"

Chapter 309 Type-1 Universal Magic Manual (1)
﻿After their short briefing, Jacob was given a courtyard to stay in the Dark Castle while Hallberg returned to his lab, which was in the basement of the Dark Castle.Hallberg inhaled a sharp, long breath for a moment as if he was completely exhausted before taking out a wine bottle and starting to drink directly from it.Only after calming his nerves did he stop and mutter, "Those two big offs almost ruined everything today. They even robbed me of that astonishing treasure, and I can't even ask for it since I would lose too much face, and he might not even agree to give it away anymore. Since I couldn't after my own gift was used against me…"Hallberg still couldn't forget about the disc despite not showing it on his face. He really wanted it after seeing its abilities. However, he wasn't that shameless to ask Jacob about it since it was not his to ask for. It still made him indignation, nevertheless.In the end, he was still glad that despite Water Wave's foolishness, the thing went extremely well, and he secured Jacob's help which was his true purpose anyway.He asked coldly at this moment, "How did you deal with Water Wave?"Dark Rose's voice sounded, "According to the Dark City laws, Viscount Water Wave has attempted assassination on the City Administrator's guest. The Guest's identity was 1-Star privilege holder, Current Alchemy Guild Leader of the Dark City: Faceless Ancient."Her crime magnitude is graded: D!"Thereby, she has been demoted to Upper Dark Noble, all her assets have been confiscated, and she will be imprisoned for 100 years!"Hallberg pursed his lips as he said, "Only D? Not C?" He was clearly unsatisfied with this punishment as that bitch almost ruined everything, yet she was getting out of it too easily.Dark Rose emotionlessly replied, "Crime above D Grade can only be denoted against at least Baron Rank Dark Nobles or if she had killed the guest. The punishment is all in accordance with the Dark City rules and regulations."Hallberg then only cussed in his mind as he knew even he couldn't interfere with the punishment process of the Dark Nobles above the Upper Dark Noble Rank. He can only call for a trial, but the judge will always be Dark Rose, who monitors every Dark Noble in the Dark City."Alright, in a hundred years, who knows where I'll be? That guy might've already forgotten about her as well, so it's fine, I guess." He muttered ruefully before his expression turned solemn, "How is the evacuation plan being handled?""It's ready. I just need your final confirmation to initiate it, and all the Dark City will be shifted to our Secret Bunker No: 3 and merged with the Dark City of the Freedom Plains. City Administrator Dark Viscount has already been informed, and he's preparing as we speak."Hallberg's expression great eased up when he heard it, and his lips curled into a cold smile as he said, "No need to make haste anymore. I need you to wait until the Dark Being enters the Dark Zone, and only then can you start the evacuation process."In the meantime, anyone who abandoned the Dark City in need of crisis bans them if they were commoners and revoked their noble titles if they were dark nobles. You have full authority to do that according to your Time of Crisis protocol."Dark City didn't need ingrates. As for those who stayed to protect the Dark City, evacuate them and start the convergence process as we did in the freedom plains. Those people will be dead in the view of the outside world and reborn as members of the Dark City!" He declared imposingly.Dark Rose's emotionless voice rang at this moment, "Understood!"---In his large courtyard, Jacob closed himself in his room. Not because he was tired or anything, it was just that he was planning on reading the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual, which he had put on hold because he had too many things to worry about.However, now that all his preparation was over and hopefully he would find the materials from Hallberg, he has time now.Furthermore, after today's assassination attempts, he felt an urgent crisis to have another trump card like magic.Before, he still thought that having magic or not with his current self didn't really matter in the Rare Plains, and he'll research it on his way toward the epic plains since he would have too much time on his hand.But his thinking changed as he knew no amount of preparation could counter the unknown, and he needed to be absolutely prepared the best he could when he could.Now, Jacob's plan was to make some special glasses that could help him see the electromagnetic waves so he could at least see through cloaking treasures or, hopefully, abilities.He was quite positive that it would work since he could do the same in the 15X or higher-level acceleration.Afterward, he would go to the marked location in Mason's map scanner to see if he could get his hands on more plutonium. That's why he gives Hallberg a 1-month time period since he knows he will be done with this small chore if he puts his top speed to use.Anyhow, the magic became his priority again as he was traveling with Hallberg, which he clearly didn't trust fully, so every extra advantage could decide a matter of life and death for him.Jacob opened the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual and skipped the introduction part since he already had it down just for the sole reason of not being ignorant about it anymore.In the introduction, the power structure was the same as Immortika described it about the Common, Rare, and Extraordinary Ranks and their tires and then the nine-star magic cores.The only extra information it had was about the Magic Spells and Magic Scriptures.A Magic Spell was like a command that could manipulate Mana in the Magic Orbits.The manual described the Magic Orbits as the channels of invisible pathways that are spread in every being's body, and they were what caused the mana to circulate in the entire body.Before forming a magic core, all the Magic Orbits could be said in disarray as they didn't have a command center to manipulate them. The very first steps, called the primary stages, were the process of arranging these disarrayed magic orbits.Only once these magic orbits were fully arranged could they be connected with one energy source, which was the Magic Core. The magic core actually formed once all the magic orbits could focus on one focal point.Mostly, magic cores can form in three spots, the head, the middle of the chest, or below the navel. These spots could be different depending on a race's talent in magic as some formed magic cores in their head like the magic beast while some in their bellies like elves and some between their chests like orcs or trolls. Lastly, every Magic Orbits set has its own unique elements, which will decide the element of the magic core once it is formed. According to the manual, it can't be changed or manipulated as it was inherited.The Magic Spells were ranked based on the mana they used upon casting. A 1-Star Magic Spell would take the lowest amount of mana, while a 9-Star Magic Spell would take the highest.Then there was casting time as well. The higher-level spell one was casting, the more time it would take. But this flaw can be solved by learning silent casting, which was actually a magic scripture that usually didn't exist in the Rare Plains!

Chapter 310 Type-1 Universal Magic Manual (2)
﻿A Magic Scripture, unlike Magic Spell, doesn't have anything to do with using magic; instead, it can do two things.First, Magic Scripture can refine the Mana and make it more potent or cultivate, thereby making the magic core achieve higher ranks. These Magic Scriptures were known as Magic Evolution Scriptures.The second and rare type of Magic Scripture can alter or modify the Magic Orbits, thereby granting someone a special ability related to magic like the Silent Casting Ability. These magic scriptures were known as the Magic Ability Scriptures.Lastly, there were some extremely rarest types of Magic Scriptures that can not only make magic core evolve but can also grant certain abilities by evolving a magic core in a special direction, making it more compatible with those abilities.These Magic Scriptures were then called the Universal Scriptures!When Jacob learned about the Universal Scriptures, he instantly thought about the time when Immortika introduced itself as One of the Nine Universal Godly Scriptures.Upon his inquiry with Immortika, he was only met with frustration, as always. Still, one thing was quite clear, Universal Scripture and Universal Godly Scripture were completely different, and the difference was like heaven and earth.Jacob mused the Universal Godly Scriptures were a higher and perfect form of a Universal Scripture or even more advanced than his imagination since he was the owner of one himself.But this also made him even more perplexed since he still can't use magic despite owing a Universal Godly Scripture!Anyway, Jacob didn't get any further information except this vague introduction to the realm of magic, while he was hoping to have more information on the Growth Type Magic Cores as well.But knowing their rarity, he knew their information wouldn't be lying around in just one simple book.Lastly, the Type-1 Universal Magic Manual has basic and rare element spells, each from 1-Star to 9-Star, and most importantly, a Rare Rank Magic Evolution Scripture in it, which only has guidance on Primary Stages, Sensing, Using, and Storing on basic and rare elements. It could be said the most basic and lowest rank Magic Evolution Scripture in existence, but knowing the rarity of a Magic Scripture, and there might not be two in the entire rare plains, Jacob knew he should be happy that he even had one.Jacob directly opened the scripture written in the manual as he can only use those spells once he awakes mana first and know his element.However, at the start, what he read made him narrow his eyes in scrutiny.'Please test your magic aptitude with Magic Aptitude Orb and confirm if you're a blanker or not.'In case of None Blanker: You can skip through the information below and start magic training with the Magic Evolution Scripture if you have Basic or Rare Elements.'(Note: If you do not have Basic or Rare Elements, this Scripture is useless for you!)'In the case of Blanker: You need to either awake a Basic or Rare Element first to train in this scripture, or you need a Magic Evolution Scripture for Blankers.'Recommendation (1): You should search for Magic Evolution Scripture for Blankers that can truly bring out your true potential because it would allow you to train in multiple elements at once. It is the advantage of being a Blanker.'Recommendation (2): If you can't find the Magic Evolution Scripture for Blankers or are satisfied with only basic or rare rank elements, then please perform an Element Aptitude Test by downloading this star network application through this link. It would tell you which element you have the most affinity with and how you could increase the affinity further. You just need 100% affinity with basic or rare elements to get rid of your blanker state and start training with this scripture.'(Warning: Chose your element wisely as once you get rid of your blanker state it's not reversible!)'Jacob was astonished after reading the entire thing as he didn't think there was such a thing about Blankers, and they seemed far more extraordinary than the rare plains know about them.'So, a blanker has a special type of scripture for them which can help them train in multiple elements? It has to be quite rare…' Jacob couldn't help but frown when he thought about the last point and shook his head bitterly, 'I have no idea where I can find even normal magic scriptures except the champion shop, much less a specific scripture for Blankers which seemed nothing but ordinary…'The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was only a pipe dream to get his hands on something like the scripture for blanker in a short amount of time. At least there was over a 99% chance that they might not even exist in the rare plains.'I can't be greedy or can delay learning magic anymore, especially if the killer skull society has more of those mutants waiting for me out there somewhere. If I have no life, then there's no point in having talent or a natural gift that I can't even use.'Preserving my life came first, and it's not like I don't have a Godly Scripture already, so being greedy will only lessen my life, not increase it. My goal is immortality, not supremacy.' Jacob's eyes shimmered with undying resolve as he recited his true goal.Without hesitation, he then tapped on that special link given in the scripture, which took him directly to a unique interface.The applications on the Star Network could only be accessed by links or invitations. There was no application store for them, just like private servers.Furthermore, higher-level star watches also had their own unique applications. Like the Life Force Scale only exist in Advance Type-1 Star Watches, the lower-rank star watches need links to download it, and they are absolutely not free.Jacob read the white color interface with blue words'Welcome to Element Aptitude Scale Application Portal'Your Star Watch is fully compatible with the Element Aptitude Scale Application!'[Install Application (50,000 ZC)]'(Note: This payment is only one time and the application will be automatically registered with your Star ID and will automatically be installed upon new sign in!)'
