Chapter 21 Decker’s Journal (1)
﻿When Jacob heard this hollow sound, his eye lit up. He knew very well this kind of sound could only be made when you hit something empty inside!He quickly started to press the area, and his finger suddenly pressed something before a small trapdoor opened, revealing one cubic meter compartment.Jacob's eyes fell on two things: one was a green book while the other item also looked like a thin book shape, but it was carefully wrapped around a tatter gray cloth.Jacob first picked up the thick book with a blank green cover and ignored the old gray cloth folding.Jacob finally opened it and read the first page."Decker Shaw Journal,"A proud Alchemist of Shaw Family of Imp Goblin Race."Jacob cocked an eyebrow, seeing the words Goblin and Alchemist, and thought, 'So, I fell in the hand of a goblin, huh? No wonder this guy looks so hideous, and he's even an alchemist, which also explains his experiments.'Jacob turned the page and saw an introduction that read,"My name is Decker Shaw, and this is my journal about my research on special physiques of different races living on the Zodiac Plains."Zodiac Plains are rumored to be endlessly vast, and there lived many species in this vast plain. "There are five known regions of Zodiac Plains,"The first, Common Races Region, where live ordinary animals and that vast forest, but no one seemed to care about this region since there's nothing extraordinary about it."The second is the Uncommon Races Region, where intelligent life forms live without special physiques, bloodline, or talent. This region is also completely ignored and left alone to rot."The third region where I'm from is the Rare Races Region. This region is very popular because of the special races that live here, with many special physiques and bloodlines."The fourth region, Rarer Races Region, is the home of rarer grade races with supernatural strength and many special bloodline abilities, which made the races of this region extraordinarily proud and arrogant. They look down at us. True bastards, indeed!"The fifth region is very mysterious and called the Epic Races Region. We simply didn't have the qualification to know about this region because those bastards from the rarer races region completely blocked any kind of information about Epic Grade Races. They're their faithful dogs!"But the widely known factor about the Epic Grade Race is they possessed something called 'Magic,' which I have no idea what it is, but those bastards of Rarer Races Region were extremely fearful of it!"Jacob's heart couldn't help but beat wildly when he read to this point. This literally confirmed his guess about Magic. Although Decker's introduction was too vague about Magic, Jacob had read fantasies about Magic. He knew what this word represented… absolute power!He could also understand why those arrogant people of the Rarer Races Region were so afraid of people from the Epic Races Region.He quickly continued to read as he flipped to the next page. Just this first page revealed many things to him."The Races of Zodiac Plains are divided into ranks or grades according to the regions they're born in, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rarer, and Epic. There are different professions as well, and they're also divided into the same grades."I'm an Apothecary Alchemist, a unique profession in our Imp Goblin Race, and I love to experiment with living things of different races…."Jacob couldn't help but sneer at this point and mumble, "Sick bastard!"After that, he sat down and continued to read, completely forgetting about the other thing. He also discovered that this book was written by Decker from a very young age, as he could imagine his enthusiasm and vigorous words. It didn't sound like the cruel Decker of the present.Jacob found there were many experiments noted and some formulas of medians Decker created after a long string of experimentation.This also revealed a lot of information, but Jacob wasn't interested in Decker's alchemy research, nor could he understand it entirely because he had no clue about the alchemy of this world. Decker seemed to be an extremely high-level alchemist as well.This book could be said to be an encyclopedia for the Apothecary Alchemists, and no alchemist would reveal their research to another quickly, not to even their apprentices.This was simply Decker's life work.Jacob quickly turned page after page about alchemy. He knew this book would be beneficial if he decided to become an alchemist, but now he was interested in the information.As Jacob turned page after page, the writing became more refined and mature and exempt from Young Decker's bullshit, while his experiments also became longer and longer.Jacob finally decided to just see to the end since this book was eight inches thick and almost complete!He wanted to know what kind of experiment Decker was doing on him before he took over this body.He finally found the last entry, which was about his blood change result. Decker left it empty, which meant he was going to write it after checking Jacob's blood analysis report, but it never happened!Jacob turned back many pages, and after turning back over hundred pages, he saw a note which wasn't about an experiment and read it."Today, a rarer race, the Mountain Giants, approached our Imp Goblin Race. They wanted to hire some Apothecary Alchemists for an expedition inside the Rarer Races Region."This was clearly a death mission since everyone knew we'll be killed right after this expedition just so those bastards could keep this a secret. But we have no choice and can't reject their request, just like always."I was chosen with others by my arch-rival for this death mission, who had become an Elder of the Elder Council because of his top talent, and he finally decided to get rid of old me. His name is Loop, and he's a hypocrite, scheming bastard!"He had taken advantage of my research many times and gained that position that rightfully belonged to me, but alas, I was just too trusty and blindly trusted him since I was already busy with my research, and now he wanted to get rid of me once and for all, so I could not get in his way anymore."But I will not leave this book, I will take all my research to the grave, and if you're reading it, then this means I'm dead, so this is your luck you found this book, and I have no hard feelings toward you…."

Chapter 22 Decker’s Journal (2)
﻿"But I will not leave this book, I will take all my research to the grave, and if you're reading it, then this means I'm dead, so this is your luck you found this book, and I have no hard feelings toward you…."Jacob's eyes narrowed when he read Decker's note, which was more like a letter before death.'Since he continues to write, then this means he managed to escape alive from that expedition. Also, it was clear that he was hiding here from someone, which means he either ran away from his clan or those Mountain Giants. Or he somehow survives that expedition, and the other died, which also meant he can't show his face ever.'Jacob considered many other such scenarios where Decker had no choice but to hide like a rat. He turned to the next page and read. He was astonished when he was a large string of 'Hahaha…' and half the page was filled with this 'haha.'Furthermore, he became more curious, and reading the words after that made laughing,"I managed to escape alive from those scheming bastards, and not only did I manage to run, I even stole that small treasure box they unearthed from the Misty Abyss!"But I know I can't go back anymore, and they might even massacre my entire race because of me… but I don't care about those tribesmen in name who suppressed everyone they deemed a threat to their position. It's even better if they killed all of them… hahaha…"But I have to say I really pulled the wool over those big idiots and tricked them with this treasure. This will also teach them a big lesson to never look down upon a goblin!"Jacob nodded slightly when he seemed his guess was correct and read to the next page,"I come to one of my hideouts in Rainy Mountain Ranges right between the boundary of uncommon and rare races regions. It is the only place where I had set up a facility for my experiment; no one knows about it."After cleaning my tracks, I finally felt relief and turned my attention to the small treasure chest. This treasure chest is ancient and only sealed with a wooden lock and a strange piece of cloth filled with a strange symbol."Nevertheless, I broke it opened and found three things. An ancient beast skin letter, A Pendant that looked like a snake eating its own tail, and A thin book that was carefully wrapped in a tatter gray cloth."The words on this letter were from a very ancient language, which we called 'rune language.' I only had a little understanding since our goblin race is keen on collecting all kinds of knowledge."There were only two red words on this palm size beast skin letter, and I don't know if I translated it correctly, but it means, 'Cursed Immortality.' I didn't know what the other person was trying to imply by these words, but I didn't see any profound meaning behind them."As for the pendant, it looked highly new without a scratch and vivid, so I know it was extraordinary and kept it."The last thing was that thin book wrapped in the gray cloth. When I unwrapped it, its cover was utterly white without any scratch or decay. If I didn't open the old chest myself, I would never even believe this newly-looking book was unearthed."And there were three words inscribed with dark ink on its cover, which were also in the rune language, and I was shocked when I translated them. It said, 'Immortal Making Journal'!"I thought it was bullshit until I opened it. I don't know if this was my imagination, but the moment I looked at those rune letters, I could instantly understand them, as if I were reading my mother language. "The more I read, the more astonished I become. If this journal was real, then one could really archive immortality by following those instructions."But I won't believe it entirely because the instructions in this journal were just too unreal. First, you have to change your heart with a modified heart, and there is only a one percent chance of survival!"I will first ensure the authority of those words before I try them on myself. This is just too crazy, but if it is true, I will become a powerful immortal and take revenge on those bastards!"Jacob's eyes twinkled like stars when he saw words like immortality and a journal that can make someone immortal. Even though he didn't dare to believe it, his heart couldn't help but beat fast as he closed Decker's journal.He finally got his answer to why Decker was doing these experiments on him and why he was so desperate to succeed.It was all because of this Immortal Making Journal!Who didn't want immortality? Who didn't want to live an everlasting life? Who can resist such temptation? Only self-righteous idiots!Jacob's biggest wish was immortality, and he didn't want to die this time around.Even in his past life, he tried every single method to prolong his life, even if that was utter bullshit. He didn't believe it before he tried himself.Now a journal was offering direct immortality to him? How could he resist? It's not like he lost anything since he only had five or so years to live because of Decker's experiments.In a sense, he was already following the path inscribed on that journal, so he wanted to see if it was really worth it!

Chapter 23 Immortal Making Journal
﻿Jacob slowly moved towards the hidden compartment while holding his breath. His eyes were fixed on the gray wrapping.Although he knew this might really be just a sham, he still didn't want to believe it completely and hoped there might be some truth hidden in that journal.Jacob extant his hand, which was slightly trembling from anxiety and fear at the same time.He unwrapped the gray cloth, and a thin white book appeared in front of Jacob's shimmering eyes.This book was two inches thin and looked highly ordinary. If he didn't read Decker's journal, he might have thought this was a newly purchased book by him.Moreover, there was a black-inked title on the white book cover, which was a collection of strange symbols that he obviously didn't understand.Without any further delay, Jacob extended his hand toward the book. He wanted to see if he could read its contents with no prior understanding of it, just like Decker.If it worked, he had no choice but to believe this book, which he also wanted. But if it didn't, then he could only curse his luck.Because he can't understand any of those symbols on the cover, Decker would never teach him even if he begged.However, the moment Jacob's hand touched the book. His heart jolts thunderously…More accurately, it was not his heart but that mysterious strand of energy that always seemed dormant and completely under Jacob's control.It wasn't just the strand of energy but the dark pendant which he got from Decker, and right now, it was hanging on Jacob's neck, also starting to heat up!Jacob was shocked by this strange turn of events, but he knew it all started when he touched the white book.Any sane person would instantly retrieve their hand, but Jacob didn't. On the contrary, not only did he not retract his hand, he even gripped the book!Jacob's thoughts differed completely from others.Firstly, Jacob deemed this was an opportunity, a life-changing opportunity!Because after controlling that strand of energy for months and circulating it in every part of his body, he knew it wasn't harmful to him at all.Secondly, when he touched the book, that pendant also reacted, and from Decker's journal, he knew this pendant was found with this book, so it gave him even more courage to take this gamble!Thirdly, Jacob now knew this strand of energy was the product of Decker's experiments, according to this book, and since it reacted to his touch, then this meant there was a big reason behind it! Lastly and most importantly, Jacob was a reincarnated person and someone insane for immortality, and as long as he saw hope, he'll do anything to get it, and he saw a big hope in this book!As Jacob gripped the book, he felt the eager sensation from the energy becoming stronger and stronger, as if it wanted to jump out of his chest.As for the pendant, it suddenly started to shift toward Jacob's heart like a pendulum on its own!It was evident for Jacob to guess that it was moving towards the energy or the energy was making it move towards it!When the pendant finally fixed on the position where his heart was and also right above the energy strand, Jacob suddenly shrieked in pain.He clearly felt the energy coming out while drilling through his heartHe wanted to clench his chest, but he didn't and endured. He was afraid to interrupt whatever was happening, nor did he let go of the book.Not only that, but he just looked like a lunatic while screaming to avert his pain while continuing to stand still.After ten seconds, which were like ten years for Jacob, he finally felt something drilling out of his skin, and he watched as a very thin crimson needle came out of his chest as blood flowed from the small hole.Like a bolt of lightning, that red needle instantly passed through from the hollow pendant and directly entered the white book in Jacob's hand!However, this wasn't the end. The next moment, the white book in Jacob's hand turned into a white streak and entered the black pendant handing on his neck!Jacob was breathing and coughing heavily as blood trickled down from both corners of his lips, and his chest was also dyed red. A hole in the heart wasn't a joke. Even a small one was enough to kill.However, Jacob's eyes were shining like the sun when he saw what happened, but he also knew he couldn't remain like this, or he might really die.He said in a hoarse voice, "P-Pig Head, take me to your glass cell and activate that black liquid and protect me."Pig Head listlessly followed Jacob's command and arranged him inside his own glass cell, which was much faster than Decker's glass cell.Jacob also decided to use Decker's black liquid just in case. He heard Decker saying that this liquid was the highest-grade healing liquid he had stored here.After arranging Jacob's body in the glass cell, Pig Head pressed a black button which was right inside the glass cell, and afterward, it closed, and light black liquid filled from the bottom.Jacob was almost unconscious because of blood loss, and he only felt a freezing sensation from that black liquid and warmth from the pendant on his neck before he fell unconscious.Pig head remained still outside, protecting Jacob as he commanded.Inside the glass cell filled with black liquid, if Jacob were conscious, he would shock to see the pendant on his chest currently glowing in a white hue as the eyes of the snake were glowing brightly.Suddenly, something emerged from the interior of the snake ring.Two white lines slowly form from the interior and connect to the opposite side while twisting in a '~' shape and forming a white '∞' symbol in the empty interior!

Chapter 24 The Truth
﻿In endless darkness,An old man with a tall and bony body was floating aimlessly without any clothes. His wrinkled face was peaceful, while his murky eyes were staring into the dark void without blinking.This old man was none other than Jacob in his actual old frame before his sudden death.'So, it was just a dream, after all.' He thought bitterly, 'I have really outdone myself in creating such a reality like a dream… sigh… death… death… death… I wasn't able to escape you in the end, even in my dreams, heh.'I always wonder; was life so weak that it can't even win against death? Now I got my answer… life and death. They said they both have two sides of a coin… but it's wrong, it's indeed a coin, but you didn't have the luxury to flip this coin because it's constantly flipping endlessly until it eventually fell and stopped.'In the end, the side of death always wins… the period it took while flipping is the life which will come to an end, but it still gave false, painful hope that it will fall on the side of life, but the truth is there isn't a life on any side of this coin only death and misery….''Hahahaha…'At this moment, Jacob's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by an eerily laughter, which frightened him.'What? I'm hallucinating again?' Jacob thought.That eerily voice spoke this time, "Well said, old brat, well said! Equal life and death cycle are just bullshit. There's only endless death and fleeting life. There's just no comparison!"Jacob's mind jolted this time. He finally understood he wasn't hallucinating because he could clearly hear this voice inside his head, and he didn't seem to move his body at all. It was the same feeling he felt when affected by the parasite gem, but it was far more horrible!He shouted in his mind, "Who are you?!" The eerily voice playfully replied, "What, you already forget that you're the one who awakened me!"Jacob's mind trembled when he heard this, suddenly remembered the mysterious white book, and promptly asked, "You're the Immortal Making Journal?""Hahaha…" The eerily laugh rang again before it said playfully, "That name was just to trick everyone. That's not my true form!"Jacob felt a chill all over his body when he heard this and questioned with an unfriendly voice, "So, it wasn't a dream, but why did you want to trick others? Are you a ghost that wants to possess me?"Jacob wasn't an idiot, and he knew if this thing wanted to trick others, then this meant it wasn't something good, so he quickly raised his guard.The eerily voice replied with a hint of disdain, "Of course, to find a worthy successor that can inherit me. But alas, those fools can never condense the Immortal Mark and always end up dying by walking on the wrong path."Jacob was shocked by this sudden realization and asked, "So, you're saying that Immortal Making Journal was just a big test that no one could pass?""Yes, the first two parts, 'Heart Changing' and 'Blood Changing,' were a kind of test to see if the other could condense an Immortal Mark which would awake me, but alas, those inferior beings were just too talentless and never able to awake me."Some of them thought these words were empty, and they were afraid to change their heart because it sounded too unrealistic and dangerous. Very few believed my incarnation words and tried it, but almost 99% died because they had a very weak soul."You see, in my endless years of existence, only ten beings could condense the Immortal Mark, but those idiots didn't have the courage or patience until I woke up, and they always either threw my incarnation away or didn't wear the Infinity Pendant."All because they thought I was too suspicious or when they felt the pain of immortal mark drilling through their hearts, they become even more determined that I'm harming them. One of them even threw away the Infinity Pendant once after calling it ugly, and that ugly swine died cluelessly after following my incarnation's third modification."She didn't know the pendant will always return to me, no matter what and where it was. That arrogant swine deserved to die, nevertheless."The last one was even more excessive, and that little lizard even dared to seal me with a ghost-eradicating talisman and then buried me deep underground. That fool was just too damn hateful. It even tried to burn me and then decomposed me. But he has no idea that the great me can't be destroyed even if he awakened his ancestors, humph!"Jacob was completely speechless after hearing such truth and couldn't help but feel this book was just too arrogant and unrealistic. But he has no way to retort it since he knew this book was unearthed by Decker's party and heard its last phase. It was clear it was telling the truth.He also knew this 'Infinity Pendant' was the same pendant hanging around his neck, and he finally remembered a snake eating its tail was also the ancient symbol of infinity!He couldn't help but ask, "Then that strand of energy that drilled through my heart was an Immortal Mark?"The eerily voice said with a hint of excitement, "Yes! The Immortal Mark only forms after the modified heart completely resonates with the body and new blood. But your heart not only resonated but also mutated, which was almost unbelievable."That's why your immortal mark was unique, and you could control it at will, and you even managed to open all the meridian channels and acupuncture points of your body with it as well."I must say, you're really something. Not only did you manage to condense the special immortal mark, but you even used to turn the table on that little idiot who would've died just by the first modification. He was just foolishly experimenting on everyone while completely ignoring the fact his body structure differed greatly from others, nor did he know about the soul strength."Jacob finally understood everything and couldn't help but feel chills when he thought just how this book created such cruel tests to find a successor, and no wonder no one could succeed.Because only crazy people will dare even to consider changing their heart and blood and then even wait until something is drilled out of their heart!

Chapter 25 Cursed Immortality! (1)
﻿"So, you were watching me?" Jacob asked. He was now serene again."Hahaha… My incarnation and the infinity pendant are my eyes and ears. I can observe my surrounding with both of them, but I can't interfere with or express my thoughts to anyone without finding a real successor."I was also watching your every action, and must I say you're a lunatic. Not only did you manage to break free from that little slave stone, you even dared to endure the pain of an immortal mark drilling through your heart while gripping my incarnation. I have never seen someone playing with their life like this before!"Jacob wryly replied, "You don't understand. If you're watching me, you have already seen that device result, and I only have little time to live, so I just wanted to see if I can gain the secret of immortality."Even though there was only a one percent chance that it was true, I'll still take it without any hesitation because now I'll rather die for that one present chance of life rather than live with a ninety-nine percent chance of death with a hoax life."Jacob truthfully answered, hiding nothing."Hahaha… only someone who experienced true death can know what I mean to live. I'm I right, Jacob Steve from Earth?" The eerily voice playfully called Jacob as such.Jacob merely sneered, "Heh, yes, you're right."He never even thought for a second that this thing couldn't read his mind or see his memories because this book was just too mysterious and was talking inside his mind. And it was talking about the soul like drinking water. Then it was nothing but simple."Let me ask you, then, do you want immortality?"It was a simple question, but this time this voice sounded solemn!Jacob suddenly felt this question was as heavy as a mountain, but this was his biggest wish. He will give anything for it, so he answered without any hesitation, "Yes!""Think carefully, immortality will grant you an endless life, but all those you love or will love will perish one by one, leaving you alone every single time. Think, if one day everyone and everything turned into nothingness, and only you remained, you can't even kill yourself. You just had to live with nothing but darkness… do you still want immortality?" It asked again with a solemn tone.Jacob felt a shiver in his spine this time. It's not like he never thought like this before, but immortality was just a legend before as well. But now that he was given a chance, he was forced to think this way and even hesitate.Suddenly, a beautiful face surfaced in his mind, and he remembered a very painful memory that he had buried deep in his mind for decades,"JS, I don't want to leave you and my children… but it seems life won't allow it. Just promise you won't forget me, ever….""Hope…"Jacob quickly recovered and menacingly replied, "I don't care about anything as long as I live endlessly, so yes, even if everything turned to dust, I still want immortality!""Even if you have to sacrifice everything, kill everyone, destroy everything which comes between you and Immortality, will you still want it, even if the price is to become a vicious devil?" This voice was icy, like an abyss!Jacob was again momentarily stunned before decisively answering, "I don't care, so yes! I'll pay any price!""Hahahaha… good, very good, you have resolved to do anything for immortality, and only someone with this kind of resolved can walk the path of an immortal who's willing to sacrifice anything and keep walking forward…." The maniacal eerily laughter rang again with a hint of hysteria."Congratulations, you have passed the third test of absolute resolved, and with this, you have passed all three tests and become my first inheritor from time immemorial."Let me officially introduce myself. I'm one of the Nine Universal Godly Scriptures 'Cursed Immortality,' and I'm also the only scripture that can grant true immortality!"Jacob was shocked. He never thought this thing was still testing him, but he was gobsmacked when he heard the other words. However, he felt remarkably calm. Jacob asked ambiguously, "You're saying, beside me, no one can inherit your prowess or become immortal?"Cursed Immortality replied with a hint of pride, "Yes, the Nine Godly Universal Scriptures can only be inherited by a single person. It was impossible to learn until that inheritor died, and I'm the only scripture that grants true immortality!"Jacob asked again, "Then, I'm an immortal now?""No, you're still a mortal and extremely weak one. You have a little over five years to live, and you have to change your body according to the real me. Or I don't want to become inheritor-less again." Cursed Immortality, said, with no hint of anxiety.Jacob only sighed and lamented, "Why I'm not surprised all that talk, and you're still useless. In the end, I have to rely on myself."Cursed Immortality sneered, "Yes, you're correct, you have to rely on yourself if you want to achieve immortality, and I know you have resolved it, so I'm looking forward to your performance!"Now listen carefully. I don't have much time left since the inheritance test is complete."Firstly, in the future, I won't be able to communicate with you freely like this before you complete phase one."Second, I cannot help you even if you were to die, remembered I'm just a scripture, not a weapon."Third, now that you're my inheritor, I'm in my true form, which is living inside the Infinity Pendant, and that pendant is now bound to you. No one can take it from you, nor will it drop. So you don't have to worry about losing it."Fourth, you can only summon me once a day for half an hour by thinking or calling my name."Fifth, you will only gain access to the knowledge of 'Body Transformation Phase One. Before completing it, you won't be able to see the Second Phase."Sixth, now that Infinity Pendant has been activated, you'll get one cubic meter of storage space. You can store anything living or none living being inside the Infinity Pendant as long as it can fit inside."That's all for now. In the future, you'll be able to do far more with Infinity Pendant as long as you cultivate me to higher phases."Lastly, free advice. Don't throw that beast skin with red letters. It is very useful for you in the future…."

Chapter 26 Cursed Immortality! (2)
﻿Jacob suddenly opened his eyes in bewilderment as he looked around and saw himself in black liquid, and Pig Face, broad, ripped back, could vaguely be seen.'Was it a dream?' Jacob thought, but he soon shook his head since it was too vivid for a simple dream and confirmed it since it was straightforward.He looked at the button panel, which was inside the glass cell's top corner, and pressed the button, making the black liquid sink.'This cell is probably more advanced than the other one, or it's just that the other cell is for prisoners or something,' Jacob mused as he saw his vision becoming clearer.He saw his body and smiled bitterly. There wasn't any chance, except the small hole in his chest was gone entirely, and he didn't feel any pain in his heart.'I should be that black liquid, I guess.' Jacob nodded in satisfaction before his eyes landed on the pendant, and he was astonished when he saw the white infinity symbol right in the center of the snake circle.'Infinity Pendant, huh.' Jacob touched the white infinity symbol, which was as smooth as jade and spinnable. There was nothing extraordinary about it except its new appearance. No one would believe it if Jacob said it was a treasure.The glass cell slid open at this moment, and Jacob came out with a hint of excitement on his bony face."You can go back and use the blue liquid now." He first excused Pig Head before he got closer to the table.Jacob looked at Decker's journal and placed his hand on it before he thought of storing the book inside the infinity pendant, and the book instantly vanished!Jacob nearly laughed out loud when he saw this was really a storage treasure that he had read about in all those fantasies, which also confirmed that it wasn't a dream.He quickly calmed himself down and again thought of taking the journal out before it emerged in Jacob's hand again!After trying a few more times and getting the hang of it, Jacob stopped playing with the infinity pendant.'This storage space is too little, only one cubic meter, but I guess I have to do with it now.' Jacob thought before he stored Decker's journal inside the infinity pendant again and moved toward the hidden compartment.He removed the gray cloth in which cursed immortality's incarnation was wrapped and saw palm size beast skin. He didn't forget Cursed Immortality's last advice. Furthermore, he saw some red letters which, according to Decker's journal, spell 'Cursed Immortality' as well.'Didn't that book say no one knows its name, but then why did its name engrave on this beast's skin, and how is it useful to me?' Jacob couldn't help but think of this point as he found nothing special about this beast's skin or red letters.'According to that book's explanation, it was buried by the last immortal mark bearer, which was a 'lizard' this means this book can be inherited by any kind of life form as long as they passed those vicious tests, not just humans, and I'm currently in a world filled with monsters.'But is it really as simple as it told me it is? I can't completely take that book's words for truth. It can read my mind, but I can't, but since it still told the truth about the infinity pendant, I guess I have no choice but to believe it. Let's try summoning it now.'Jacob also thought before he stored that beast's skin in the infinity pendant. He also stored that Bloodline Scanning Scale inside the pendant since it was essential to him for measuring his lifespan. Jacob sat down on the only chair in the room before he took a deep breath and thought, 'Cursed Immortality!'Suddenly, a white book appeared in front of Jacob, floating in the air.It was slightly glowing in a black hue; its cover size was 9 X 12 and an inch thick. There wasn't any clue about its spine or pages. It was just like a slate. In the center of it were beautiful crimson words that Jacob could clearly understand despite never having seen them before. Those crimson words spell 'Cursed Immortality.' Nothing else was on the cover.Jacob was astonished at seeing the floating slate in front of his chest. He couldn't help but try to touch it, and he could and felt this book's jade smooth cold cover.Jacob tried to flip the slate to see the other side, but it turned like a book cover before revealing a white page in thin air. There were crimson words written on it as well. As for the cover, it vanished into the other side in the air.'So, that's what it means when it said it was in its true form now. Does this mean this book is extremely thick that I can't fit in this room?' Jacob wondered in astonishment. 'Truly magical, really. I don't see and feel all this with my eyes and hands. I wouldn't believe it's real. But it still made me worry about just how thick this book is. Won't I die before I complete it and archive immortality!?'Jacob wasn't swayed by just befits. His eyes were still on the facts.He sighed before reading the very first page, which was the same size as its cover."Cursed Immortality: Cursed Immortal Physique (Nine Phases)"Current Phase: First Phase"First Phase: Body Transformation"Stages of Body Transformation: Three"First Stage: Cursed Heart Emergence"Second Stage: Compete First Stage"Third Stage: Compete Second Stage"Inheritor (Jacob Steve) Current Stage: 10% of First Stage"Jacob's eyes narrowed when he saw the very first page, which revealed little information with much mystery.'Why is there cursed everywhere?" Jacob finally paid attention to the word cursed, even though this book's name was Cursed Immortality.Before in his excitement, he paid little attention to it, but now that he did, he felt this book was defiantly now simple, and it didn't reveal everything clearly about itself!

Chapter 27 Immortal Mark Into Cursed Mark
﻿In the end, Jacob could only sigh because first, he was the one who decided to walk on this unknown path, and second, he couldn't question cursed immortality because it couldn't communicate with him before he completed the first phase and lastly, even if he got another chance to choose, he'll still choose to walk on this path without any regrets!Jacob flipped the first page, and it vanished to the other side of the air before revealing a new page with new information.It was information about the cursed heart emergence,"First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Heart Emergence (First Stage)"This stage is divided into three levels"First Level: Formation of Immortal Mark Inside the Modify Heart (Complete)"Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark (01% Completion)"Description: Please insert different Tier-1 or higher species' heart essence directly into your heart until the cursed mark is completely forged."Note: A species' heart essence can only be inserted once, not again."Third Level: Complete Second Level"Completion of this stage affected in; 100 Years Youthful Lifespan "Jacob cocked an eyebrow when he saw the description about the second level of Cursed heart emergence and when he saw the reward of completing it, his heart galloped.'Youthful Lifespan? Did this mean I won't turn into an old man?' Jacob couldn't help but feel moved, just this first stage effect alone.This made him even more determined to walk on this path even if he had to go through hell!Jacob tried to turn the page, but no matter how much force he mustered, it won't just budge, and when he tried to go backward, just with a thought, the previous page emerged, and with another thought and page turned again.This also clarified that no matter what, he won't be able to see the other knowledge without completing the previous one.So, Jacob gave up and said, "So, I have to find the heart essence of other species now and then inject it into my heart directly. No need to circulate anything or mutter any chants or mantras or anything?"This is rather convent and simple, but this also means I have to kill them to get that heart essence. But how the hell am I supposed to know this is heart essence, and how would I know if the species is tier-one or not?"Jacob became extremely perplexed when he thought this book had only given him half-ass information. However, the wording on the second page suddenly changed, and he was astonished when he read it."Tier-1 species are known as the Uncommon Species in this world. As for heart essence, let me make it precise in your language. After collecting the steam, you can gain heart essence after boiling the heart into the species' own blood inside a furnace at 1000 Celsius temperature. The steam is the Heart-Essence, and you only need 100-milliliter to inject into your heart."Jacob felt goosebumps all over his body when he read it. This meant he had to kill no matter what!He frowned, "So, you can answer my questions?"The wording changed again, and it read:"Only questions related to the scripture." "Then tell me, does one species per heart mean an entire race or just a subspecies of that species? If I kill that imp-goblin, then does it mean the entire Goblin race will become useless to me, or just the imp-goblin race?" Jacob's eyes turned cold when he asked this question.The words changed again. "Only the subspecies, not the entire species. Simply put, as long as you get the heart blood of the imp goblin race, then you can't get anything out of another imp goblin, but if you get the heart of a vile goblin, then it will work but only once. This also meant you must kill one member of a single tribe until you complete level two of cursed heart emergence, hahaha…."Jacob felt annoyed when he saw the 'haha' he could imagine that eerily laughter and pursed his lips and asked again, "Then what about Youthful Lifespan?"The words changed again, "No old age and grantee a hundred years, as long as others won't kill you… hahaha…""Fuck off." Jacob annoyingly replied. He just felt annoyed every time this book spoke."Make the classification of these species clearer, like the requirement for me, is to get at least one species heart essence, but it also said 'higher' as well. The imp goblin is a rare species, so will I get any benefits for ingesting higher species blood than a requirement or not?" Jacob asked another core question.The words changed. "So, you're not so dumb after all. Those idiots only classified the species into Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rarer, Epic, and so on, but the truth is, it's not that simple. Because some species can be more powerful than rare species despite being uncommon because they have the potential to evolve, the rank of species is never evaluated like this."They are divided into tiers. From one to three tires can be considered uncommon species with low, intermediate, and advanced levels; from four to six, they can be regarded as a rare specie with the same three levels. From tier seven to nine, those tiers suit the rarer species, while the Epic species are not classified into tiers. They had a classification of their own, which you don't need to know for now."That imp goblin is from a tier-five species, but his bloodline is too thin. That's why he's akin to a tire-three: if you really ingest his heart essence, then your progress will naturally be faster, though."Jacob's eyes shone with understanding. "All in all, as long as I can a higher species heart essence, my progress will be skyrocketed, but how the hell did I know their exact tier?""I don't know. It's your problem. But you can ask me by wasting your one chance of summoning me a day, hahaha..."Jacob frowned. He knew this book could only give him limited help and sighed. With a thought, the book vanished again. He had no more questions and wasn't in the mood to listen to that annoying book's laughter.He threw his head back to the chair, stared at the rotten ceiling, and sighed continually.Likewise, he muttered, "A path forged with killing leads to immortality, huh? If it was in my youth, I might probably feel excited about it, but now… I feel nothing but calm. I finally got a way that led to immortality, yet there's nothing but darkness. But deep down, I can never detach myself from this path, no matter what…."Jacob closed his eyes, and at an unknown time, he fell asleep on the chair. It was his first time sleeping without fear or anxiety about his life. He finally got what he wanted, but there was still a vast yet cruel price he had to pay for it!

Chapter 28 Deadly Hunger (1)
﻿After a long sleep, Jacob finally opened his eyes."I fell asleep?" Jacob mumbled drowsily.Because of his sitting posture and wooden chair, he felt soreness all over his body when he tried to move."I never thought I miss my wingback chair of all the things." Jacob smiled wryly.Suddenly, he felt extreme hunger as his expression changed because his body started to shudder slightly while his breath became rough. Jacob had no idea that after living on those liquids for so long, his body had become accustomed to them, and this was very dangerous. That was why if anyone used those liquids, they always intake food first so that they won't get addicted to those liquids.But how could Decker care about a slave like Jacob? Decker never considered Jacob would remain alive after his experiments, nor did Jacob anyone important to him. Hence, he left Jacob as it was, and now Jacob was facing a dangerous situation.If he intakes a large quantity of food so suddenly, his condition will become even more serious. At the same time, if he goes back to the glass cell and uses the liquid to stabilize his situation, his body addiction will become even more serious.In the end, Jacob searched for food without even thinking about going back and soaking in those liquids. From the start, he always wondered why he never felt hunger and if this was good or bad, and now, he finally got his answer.Jacob took things from Decker's bags, both old and new. He saw a six-by-six container, which was icy cold, and he quickly put it down since he knew this must be something Decker had bought for the third transplant, and it won't be anything he could eat.The next thing he took out were many glass bottles filled with different color powders and some strange dry plants, which were obviously auxiliary materials that were supposed to mix together with whatever was in that container.Jacob didn't dare to eat those strange plans, so he also put them aside. In the end, the new bag became completely empty, and it seemed Decker only put all the things he needed for the experiment in this bag."I don't believe this guy didn't need to eat!"Jacob's condition was becoming increasingly dangerous as he quivered more violently.He quickly picked up the old bag, which was Decker's own bag. He promptly opened its cover and took things out after another. There were two old books and two small glass flasks which reminded him of the flask of Bloodstorming Bug!He carefully placed them on the table with lingering fear. Next, he took out a palm size metallic box, and after opening it, he saw four blue capsule shape pills and three green pills.He clearly remembered Decker's feeding him a blue pill for pain, so he quickly deemed those blue pills as painkillers and didn't know what those green pills were, and he didn't have the luxury to think about it either. He put those pills aside as well.Jacob suddenly saw a hand size transparent packet and quickly took it out, and his eyes lit up when he saw dry jerky sticks inside. His hunger was getting increasingly out of control, so he didn't even think about examining it and quickly opened the pack, which was already opened. When a strange smell entered his nostrils, he wanted to vomit his stomach out.'Fuck it!' Jacob took out a dry jerky stick and tried to chew it, but it was just too damn hard, like a rotten tree trunk.He felt like he was drinking those herbal shakes he used to drink to increase his life, but more terrible!'That fucker can't even spend on himself.' Jacob cursed Decker while continuing to swallow that jerky like rotten wood.However, Jacob didn't know this jerky was made with very special meat, and it can sustain hunger for two or three days, and someone like Decker, who remained on foot for most time, this was the best choice for food.Beings like Decker weren't too picky with what they ate as long as they kept living and continued to do their research.Jacob was also like this once, but after he handed over his business to his sons, he completely changed his lifestyle, especially after his wife's death.With his full willpower, he swallowed two jerky sticks and stopped. He knew if he tried to swallow anymore, he'd throw up. Besides, his hunger was reduced after he ate those jerkies, so there wasn't any need to torture himself any further, for now at least.However, if Jacob knows he just dodged a very lethal bullet by eating those special jerkies, he might even thank Decker as well as strangle him for putting him in such a condition.He saw a bottle of water in Decker's bag and gulped it, and it just tasted like… water. Nothing special about it."Finally, alive." Jacob sighed.However, did it was really over?After he felt alive again, he finally looked at the other things in Decker's bag.He found another sealed packet of jerkies, and then he took out a white card. After reading it, he found out it was an identity card that was from Decker's nation.This turned his expression somewhat grave. 'If this world has identity cards, doesn't this mean their technology is also like my word? But this identity card has no photo or any chip. It looks more like something from the eighteenth or seventeenth century. I hope it was the case, or my life would become more complicated if this world had the same advanced civilization as my world.'Although Jacob still hasn't come in contact with this world civilization, after he saw those glass cells, colored liquids, that device that can measure someone's lifespan and read Decker's journal, he could guess this world was much more advanced when it came to the medicinal field.He had no idea about the weapons, but the parasite gem was enough proof of this world's strength on its own.As for communication and security measures, he still can't be so sure!

Chapter 29 Deadly Hunger (2)
﻿Jacob put Decker's ID card to the side carefully. He knew this could be quite useful, but he also knew it could be quite disastrous since Decker had stolen a treasure chest from a rarer race, so he would not use it if not absolutely necessary.The last thing Jacob found was a small black pouch. Upon grabbing it, he felt it was quite heavy and heard a light, sharp ringing sound as if glass or metal were clashing together."Coins?"Jacob opened the small pouch with some anticipation. This was his first time seeing the currency of this world.He upside-down the pouch on the table, and small coins landed on the table, making sharp sounds.He saw there were round coins three inches in size. There wasn't any engraving or any imprint or brand on these coins. They were all spotless. There were twenty golden, fifty-eight silver, and twenty-one bronze-colored coins.Jacob did not know the distribution of currency in this world, but seeing the three colors, he could already guess the gist of it.'I don't know if this guy was rich or poor, but since he was an alchemist, he won't be poor, at least.'Jacob mused before he placed the coins into the small pouch again and stored them inside his infinity pendant and the other things, and only left those two books and the contents of the extra bag on the table.He was interested in those two books since they were worn out. It was clear Decker read them quite often, and this was the reason enough for Jacob to read them as well.Jacob easily read their titles. One was called the 'Advance Herbology of Rare and Rarer Plants & Plant Lore.' The second was the 'Rare and Rarer Beast Encyclopedia.'Jacob's eyes shone. It was quite clear what these books were about, and Jacob needed this kind of information since he wanted to complete the first stage of the cursed heart emergence.However, just as Jacob was about to read those books, his expression changed because that extreme hunger was back!'Just what is going on? Not even two minutes passed, and I was hungry again. Did those two shit jerkies won't enough? But I clearly felt full after eating them.' Jacob became very confused.But he had no choice since this hunger was like it could kill him if he didn't ease it. He again took out the jerky packet he had just stored inside his infinity pendant and ate three jerky sticks, despite wanting to puke.He again felt quite full again, but this time he didn't let his guard down and observed if that hunger had come back again or if it was just his imagination. This time five minutes passed, and when Jacob thought it was just him being paranoid, the hunger returned stronger than ever!"There is something wrong!"Even an idiot would find this situation strange and amiss."Cursed Immortality!" Jacob tried to summon the book to learn about his situation, but it never appeared.'Shit, I can only summon it after a day, mean twenty-four hours, and I don't know how long I've been asleep, but it wasn't twenty-four hours. So I have to wait!' Jacob cursed inwardly before he started swallowing the jerky again.This time he swallowed five of them before the hunger went away.'Every time this hunger came, I needed to intake more food. Could it be some kind of effect after I live inside that liquid?'Or it's related to my extremely strong heart? It's not rocket science. Everyone knows if you put a train engine inside a car, it will explode, and my heart is mutated, according to that damn book. My body is too weak, and if my heart is really like a train engine right now, then I'm really screwed!'Jacob's mind reached an astonishing conclusion that he didn't want to acknowledge.If he knew those jerkies he was eating like normal snacks right were enough to keep Decker alive for an entire month, he would become even more assured about his latter theory, while the former hypothesis was quite close to the truth.Jacob wasn't in the mood to read anymore. He clearly knew just how much danger he was in if his guesses were correct.However, he can't just finish his limited ratio until he has a clear view of the situation, and only cursed immortality can shine some light on it."Pig Head, come out."In the end, Jacob decided to soak inside the liquid until he could summon cursed immortality again, it was far better than aimlessly wasting his rations!---Inside a thick forest with towering lush trees with high humidity,The sky was dark with rain clouds as if the rain would fall at any time.Three figures were currently moving in this thick forest at this moment.Two of them were abnormally tall, while one of them was only 1.4 meters in height, and it barely reached the two tall person's kneecaps.All three of them wore dark cloaks.One of them spoke at this moment in a husky voice, "Are you sure you saw that thievish goblin in Cloud City?"The voice came from the short person, "Yes, how could I dare to lie to esteemed lords? Although he was in a cloak. But his sharp pointy nose still somewhat revealed his identity, and after I followed him around for a while, I confirmed it was an Imp-Goblin, and he came in this way! If I wasn't afraid to follow him in this forest and contact my lords first, I might've found his hideout!""You did well not to follow him, or you've died. That thievish goblin is too cunning, and if he even got wind of you following him, he'll definitely escape! But now that we are here let's see where he runs too!" Again, the same voice sounded with a hint of hatred and killing intent!

Chapter 30 Deadly Hunger (3)
﻿"You Heartless Demon!" A sobbing voice sounded of a young man filled with bitterness and grief, "You didn't even come to her funeral and didn't show any sadness while she was on her deathbed and calling for your name every day. You don't deserve her love. You never loved her. You just left her alone even on her deathbed because of your selfishness….""NO!" Jacob's eyes snapped open, filled with deep sorrow and melancholy.However, when a slimy liquid entered his mouth, he quickly snapped out of his stupor state and calmed himself down.'I was… dreaming…' Jacob thought with deep sadness and yearning in his eyes, 'Ryan, I let you down and her….'Jacob stared into the empty air for a long time without blinking.At this moment, the blue liquid was almost transparent, which had never happened before, while Pig Head stayed inside. This implied the liquid was losing its effect, and Jacob was feeling hungry despite the liquid.But he doesn't care or not even bother to notice it because of his bad dream.In the end, the hunger reached the same level as before and made Jacob snap out of his daze.He came out of the cell. He didn't know just long he's been sleeping or how this liquid worked accurately and for how long.But his killer hunger was not normal, and he knew this had something to do with his change after he inherited cursed immortality."Cursed Immortality!" Jacob said in a hoarse voice.This time, the white book appeared in a flash.With a thought, Jacob reached the page he could open and said coldly, "Tell me what this hunger is about. Does it relate to you?"The wording changed, and unfamiliar words appeared."Why are you asking me if you already guessed? You're right about your heart being too powerful for your weak body. But don't worry, your heart was modified according to great me and even mutated. So, all you have to do is to provide nutrition, and your heart will change your body until it reaches a sufficient standard."Jacob sighed softly. "I was right. Tell me just how much nutrition I need before this hunger goes away and my body reaches a sufficient standard."The writing changed,"Just drink that bone marrow that little goblin bought for your third implant, and don't forget about mixing all those herbs and powders. It should be sufficient to convert your body to twenty percent."Jacob frowned. "Drink the bone marrow of some unknown animal or monster? But it will only convert up to twenty percent?!""Hahaha… don't underestimate a mutated heart. Besides that, twenty percent is enough for your hunger to alleviate at least half, but only for a few weeks before it comes back more potent, so be prepared!"Heed my advice. In the meanwhile, just slaughter that goblin or that pig and inject their blood, and then eat them whole. It should be enough for your body to reach fifty percent."Jacob wore a weary expression and coldly snorted, "Do you really expect me to eat those nocuous fellows?""Hahahahah… don't pretend to be noble. The moment the second wave of hunger hits, you'll even slaughter a human to quench your hunger, or you'll die, which I know you will never let happen."Oh, and remember, every time you inject a specie's heart blood, your body will also change, which simply means you need to eat or provide high-quality nutrition. And if you are thinking about using those colored waters, then don't bother. They will start to lose effect on you the longer you soak in them since they're not high-quality enough."Jacob frowned his brown as cursed immortality seen through his thoughts. He was really planning to drink that black liquid, but it seemed this wouldn't work.'This book simply wanted me to kill and then eat whoever I kill… but I want to survive, I have to…' Jacob's heart turned cold."I started to understand why you called Cursed Immortality…." Jacob commented coldly before he closed the book with a thought.He didn't want to see that maniac laughing."The things I have to do for a living from now on…."Jacob sighed softly as he walked beside the table where everything was ready.He strengthened his resolve, pulled the cold container toward himself, and opened the clay-like seal before removing the cubic meter container's top.The moment the top was removed, a potent smell filled the room, making Jacob almost faint.He saw a thick dark purple liquid like jelly."I have to drink this?!" Jacob fell into despair, but his hunger was getting stronger and stronger, and he knew he didn't have time."Damn it all!"He randomly picked those dry plants and threw them inside the container. Since the book didn't instruct him about the order, then it clearly means he can just throw them randomly.One by one, he emptied those powder bottles as well.After everything was floating in the container, he picked up a long metal spoon-like piece of equipment and stirred the entire mixer.It caused a massive reaction as those plans melted, and the jelly-like bone marrow started to boil mysteriously, and an even more potent smell rose with pinkish smoke.However, Jacob's eyes were turned bloodshot as he endured the smell. His hunger had finally reached its peak and was far more substantial than the first or second time.He finally realized that the book was really speaking the truth, and at this moment, he really would kill anyone just to quench this hunger!'I can't take it anymore!'Jacob threw the spoon to the table, picked up the container, and drank without even caring about the smell or taste or if it was hot or cold.He just wanted that deadly hunger to go away.The mixture was strikingly cold despite the smoke and its taste… he just can't describe in contrarily that jerky was far more scrumptious than this!Within a minute, he drank the whole container without dropping or leaving any single drop!
