Chapter 151 I’m Done Playing With Your Rules!
﻿Jacob looked at the swamp of incoming messages from Important Grace34 as if that guy had gone bonkers in anger by losing those skulls. There were all kinds of offers to make him give up the research data.They were even willing to let him join their ranks, which Jacob would never agree to because he didn't want any kind of chip inside his brain, and neither he would trust his enemy.So, in the end, Jacob muted the annoying prick since the block option wasn't present and then try to store the star watch inside his pendant to see if that reset message will appear or not.Because anything stored in the infinity pendant will remain as it is when the time it was stowed like time stops, whether it was living or nonliving.And just as suspected, no reset message appeared, neither he got any more messages from Important Grace34.He mused that it was probably because the star network couldn't detect the star watch and connection with it, nor the star watch. So, as long as it was stowed in the infinity pendant, no one will be able to trace him even if this watch was traceable.Furthermore, he could summon it on his wrist directly, and it appeared as it was when it was stowed away.After doing some more tests, he stowed away the other star watches because they were freaking expensive. When he tried to see their prices, he discovered that this model A-11 wasn't even on sale.He could only find a model A-09 which considers the latest model in rare plains with a price tag of 500 million gold coins and it did not have a camera function!So, Jacob knew if he put these star watches on sale, then he could instantly become a billionaire.After he was done with the matter of star watch and the loot, it was time to start the final injection!Jacob looked at the warm injection in his hand which was filled with the heart essence of an earth goblin."What irony. I started the injection process with a fucking goblin, and now I'm ending it with another goblin. I wonder if the goblin race is my lucky charm or if I'm just their nemesis of sorts." Jacob ridiculed himself with a bitter smile before his expression turned stern."This is definitely going to hurt and I might enter over 5X acceleration while crossing the 30% altogether. I know I should've done it in steps, but any rare heart will give me at least twenty percent, so adding another ten won't make much difference."Let's cross this last hurdle, and get a hundred years of youthful life and move on."After giving himself a pep talk, Jacob placed titan tears jars in front of him just in case he needed energy, and then took a deep break before his hand moved with the metal syringe.The next moment, the metal syringe was completely pierced into his heart, and warm heart essence started to submerge within his heart.Thereupon, Jacob waited for the pain to come, but to his surprise, he felt only a warm strange energy coursing through his body. He knew this energy appeared right at the end of his last injection.Although he was glad that the pain didn't come, he didn't let his guard down since it might be just the calm before the storm.As time passed, more and more of this energy started to simmer in Jacob's body little by little before it completely filled every part with him, and the whole process lasted for two hours.Yet, Jacob did not know about it as he was calm and didn't lose himself in this wonderful feeling.But the moment his body was completely brimming with this strange energy, his heart rate suddenly sped up, and that energy started to gather into his heart, or more accurately, it was getting absorbed by it!If someone cut open Jacob's chest, they would be shocked because at this moment a pitch-black haze was surrounding Jacob's heart as it beat wildly.Furthermore, the infinity-cursed mark within Jacob's heart was glowing darkly, as all that dark haze was getting absorbed by it. Not only that but as the haze was getting absorbed, the infinity-cursed mark's exterior was expanding while the symbol remained of the same size.For the first time, Jacob felt the condition of his heart, as he could feel something gently gripping and engulfing it.As a result, Jacob didn't feel any pain but emptiness, as if something was stripping away from him slowly. Although he didn't know what it was, he could tell it was something essential, something that was part of his very being.However, within this feeling of emptiness and loss, there was also something that was slowly being born.At this moment, Jacob lost the concept of time and his surrounding, he was completely submerged in that strange emptiness.Right at this moment,"why... do you seek…. Immortality…""You'll be alone… empty… despite… hated… villain""Give up… give up… stop… stop…""Turn… around… stop… now… stop…"A faint voice started to ring into Jacob's mind like an alarming bell."Come join… me… come….""You… promise… promise…" All of a sudden, Jacob's body started to flutter before dark blood gushed out from his orifices. Despite this ghastly scene, Jacob was completely expressionless as his eyes were completely closed like he was unconscious.At this moment, the dark infinity pendant on his neck suddenly glowed in the dark sheen before the white infinity symbol in the black ring started rotating while emitting a faint white glow.Immortika's perplexed voice rang at this moment, "Old dog ??? don't even think about it!"The next moment, the snake's eyes of the infinity pendant lit up before the white sheen from the spinning infinity symbol suddenly engulfed Jacob. As a result, the dark blood and his oscillation stopped, and he seemed stable again.Immortika's eerily guffawed rang in the cave, but it was filled with rage and hatred."Damn ??? this time I'm not going to sleep ever, I'm done playing with your rules… hahahahaha…""Rumbled…" A deafening thunderclap suddenly rang outside the cave at this moment.However, Immortika eerily laughs and never stopped. In contrast, it became even more exasperating!---A day and night passed by before Jacob's eyelids trembled slightly as he opened, his amber eyes gleaming in a golden hue. He suddenly frowned when he saw a faint white mist in the cave and a distinctive refreshing scent in the air."What happened? Did I fall asleep just now?" Jacob's eyes shone in confusion since he clearly remembered being in the middle of absorbing heart essence, and everything else was a blur before he just opened his eyes.He clearly did not know what had transpired when his mind was in an unconscious stateNevertheless, Jacob paid little attention to it since there were more pressing matters at hand."Did I succeed?" Jacob looked at his body, and his eyes went wide suddenly because he was butt-naked. Not only that but his bonny body was now filled with carved muscles, and his pale white skin was glossy."What the hell happened?"Jacob was completely bewildered because he was wearing his black clothes made with tiger bull's hide, but now they were completely gone, and he looked like he took a beauty bath.However, he was even more baffled when he saw the jars will titan tears were completely empty, as well as the four meat skewers!Only the equipment and the cold stone stove with wood ashes remained in the cave.Jacob was completely spooked for a moment before finally noticing, "I'm not feeling any hunger?"He then again looked at his muscular tone body and then at the empty stove and jars, and a strange possibility surfaced in his mind, 'Could it be all those things got absorbed into my body somehow when I was asleep? Is this some kind of special effect of reaching 100%? Heck, did I even reach 100%? How much time has passed?'Jacob then stood up and found his eye level had increased by three or four inches and the surrounding colors seemed brighter and more precise. He could also feel just how powerful he had gotten as he clenched his fists, making cracking sounds.But he did not know just how much power he had gotten.Jacob then donned the full-body black armor he looted. This armor was quite comfortable and was made with a flexible material that completely fit him.After getting dressed, Jacob finally opened the cavern's mouth, and the bright sun greeted him, which made his eyes narrow. 'I clearly remembered when I started the process and closed the cave mouth. It was evening? Don't tell me I slept for over twelve hours or even more. Only one way to find out!'If it appears, then it means I was in that state for over one day, and if it did not, then this means it's only been less than a full day.'Jacob's eyes turn sharp. "Cursed Immortality!"

Chapter 152 Cursed Mark Into Cursed Heart!
﻿"Cursed Immortality!"The next moment, cursed immortality appeared, hovering in the air like usual.Jacob's eyes squinted. 'So, it's really been over a day. I should be more careful in the future. If I fell into that state again and someone tried to sneak up on me, I would be completely at other's mercy.'The next moment, anticipation shone in Jacob's eyes, and he moved to the main page. He wanted to see for himself if he really crossed the 100% despite having the answer.______[Cursed Immortality: Cursed Immortal Physique (Nine Phases)][Current Phase: First Phase]----First Phase: Body Transformation-Stages of Body Transformation: Three-First Stage: Cursed Heart Emergence (Current Stage)-Second Stage: Compete First Stage-Third Stage: Compete Second Stage----Inheritor: Jacob Steve-Current Phase: First (Body Transformation)-First Stage Progress: 75%----Lifespan: 183 Years (100 youthful years)______Jacob's eyes contracted when he saw the newly emerged lifespan section on the page, which could only mean one thing. He completed the second level of cursed heart emergence and gained a hundred years.But the other 83 years surprised him, 'I might be my actual lifespan.'It was the only explanation that came to Jacob's mind at the moment. He was ecstatic nevertheless and felt like all that killing and trouble was worth it.He then turned the page to see the details about the last level.______[First Phase of Body Transformation: Cursed Heart Emergence (First Stage)]-Cursed Heart Emergence: Three Levels---First Level: Formation of Immortal Mark Inside the Modify Heart (Complete)---Second Level: Turn Immortal Mark into Cursed Mark (Complete)---Third Level: Cursed Mark into Cursed Heart[Description (1): Collect four Primary Elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind) Element Cores (Magic Core) from 1-Star to 9-Star.]-Fire: 0/9-Water: 0/9-Earth: 1/9-Wind: 0/9[Description (2): After collecting all 36 Element Core, create the following Ritual Array Formation.][Description (3): Sat in the middle of this Ritual Array Formation.]---Completion of this stage will cause 'Agelessness of Heart'______Jacob's eyes went wide when he saw the last level details, especially about the collection of 34 different element cores, which by no means was going to be easy. He experienced just how tricky someone with a 1-Star Earth Element Core was, and he needed to collect up to 9-stars, which simply meant even scarier opponents.As for the second description, there was a diagram given below, which was quite detailed, and he just needed to arrange those 34-element cores according to this diagram, and the last was even simpler.Nevertheless, Jacob still felt it would be even harder than collecting the heart's essence.As for the strange reward, he could only guess what an Agelessness of Heart could mean.For more answers, he finally turned the last page and asked the book itself, "First, tell me what happened to those bodies and titan tears."Jacob still hasn't forgotten about the mysterious absorption of those bodies and titian tears, so he could only ask someone who might know.However, he was destined to be disappointed."Hehehehe… that's all your doing, and it's not related to the scripture, so I can't answer anything about it. And here I thought you would be happy after gaining a hundred years in your life cycle, but you're grumpy as ever."Jacob frown not because of the antics of Immortika but because of its ambiguous reply. Even though it said it couldn't tell him, it still mentioned that it was his doing, which meant no mysterious power or Immortika interfered.It gave Jacob some insight into the matter, and he decided to scrutinize it.Right now, he had a more pressing matter at hand.However, before he could ask related to the third level, Immortika revealed something startling."Before you start and then I forgot, let's be done with this matter first, shall we? I have two announcements that could be only done by me."First, my summoning time has been increased from half an hour to a full hour."Second, the infinity pendant's one cubic meter space has been increased to 10 cubic meters!"Jacob was astonished when he read it, and without stopping, he tried to look into the infinity pendant, and just as Immortika said, the small space had really been increased!"Nice, right? I told you as long as you keep completing the levels, you'll never be disappointed. Now worship me! Hahahaha."Jacob's excitement was only fleeting, as he could quickly calm down for some reason.He then sneered coldly when he read the last phase. "Don't flatter yourself. So now give me a detailed explanation on this third level, especially these star-level element cores and what kind of beings I'm going up against.""Tsk, tsk, still grouchy as before. Alright, I'll tell you, it's not like I had any other choice."First, you need to know what an element is and how it is formed. It's not so complicated, actually. Anything abstract could be called an element, and this is all you need to know for now."There are four primary elements: Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind, and most of the rare level species could awake one of these four elements."Then there are Rare Elements, like Wood, Ice, Lava, Sand, and so on."There are also scarce elements like lightning, light, dark and legendary space, time elements, and so on."An Element Affinity could be awakened by any being on the Rare level, and some species at the peak common level have such potential as well, but they're extremely rare."When these beings awakened their element affinity, they could faintly sense their respective elements in the atmosphere they had an affinity with, and the rarer the element, the harder it was to sense it."And when a being could sense their respective element, this level is the very first step toward the realm of magic!"Any element has three primary stages, 'Sensing, Using, and Storing', and whoever masters these primary stages can be called an initial level element user. An initial level element user can only use a tiny amount of their respective element within the atmosphere and store a tiny amount inside their body pours."However, to use that element power, they need quite a time to prepare, so they are basically cannon folds, but they're still geniuses and godly being in the eye of those who couldn't even awake an element, much less master three primary stages."That dark elf was such a being, but her bloodline was too thin to even called her a true dark elf or you won't even have the chance to land that bullet on a true dark elf with dark element affinity!"Jacob felt his heart turn cold when he read to this point because it was simply unbelievable that even a Mack-10 speed bullet couldn't hit a real dark elf, according to Immortika."Anyhow, after the primary stages are the Star Stage, which has nine-star levels, and each level is divided into Initial, Intermediate, and Advance levels."To be called a Star level expert, one needs to nurture their ability to store the pure element power into their body, and once they reached a certain level of mastery, an element core formed within the body!"This element core will then help one to connect with the surrounding element more easily and store a large amount of pure elemental energy, which then could be used with instant spells like [Earth Spikes] through different element mediums like that beanpole wand."You have to research Spells and Element Mediums yourself. If I start to explain it, the hour is not enough."On to the main topic, as you have already experienced the power of a mere 1-Star Initial-level, you should know that a 1-star advance level in the same element could've easily sensed that goblin's position at that range and crushed him right there and then."As for 9-Star level beings, you can imagine by this that they could sense that goblin underground from a mile away and bury him within. The spell [Earth Spikes] would also have an area of one mile, and you might not be able to react before you're dead!"To make a star rank simpler, you could put it in this way: the higher the reserve of elemental energy one has, the higher their star levels. It all depends on Elemental Energy, or the being here called elemental energy, Mana."In 9 Rare-Tiers, you could only find up to Advance 3-Star level race. There's never been a rare race that had an Element Core above 3-Star. It's virtually impossible!"Jacob's eyes were filled with astonishment, and a hint of fear as this otherworldly information was revealed to him.He took a deep breath and grimly asked, "You mean to say I need to hunt species above rare rank, right?""Hahahah… isn't it obvious, or how would you find the reaming cores while being this ignorant? You needed one core of each Primary Element's Star Ranks. It didn't matter if it was initial or advance but you require all nine stars' elemental cores."The rank above Rare Rank is…!"

Chapter 153 Toward The Hideout
﻿"The rank above Rare Rank is known as Extraordinary. Like 12-Common-Tiers and 9-Rare-Tiers, the Extraordinary Rank also has different tiers."There are 6-Extraordinary-Tiers of Extraordinary Rank just like the remaining Rank of 4 to 9 Stars. Any being that could form a 4-Star Core was known as an Extraordinary, and these kinds of existence could crush any Rare-Rank like bugs."This also ends the explanation on the Element Cores and their ranks."Jacob's brows were knit together after reading the information about the Extraordinary Rank.He then asked sternly, "Then can I fight against an Extraordinary Tier-1 species right now?""Hehehe, right now your body is as strong as a peak Tier-8 Rare expert, and not every rare tier has powerful bodies. Every species has its perks and weaknesses."Some might not even awake an element in their life but still have the prowess of rare tier nine while some reach 3-star element core despite being a rare tier-1 species."However, to be called an extraordinary species, not only does one need a body as strong as a peak rare tier-9 but an element core of 4-star rank as well. Without completing these conditions, no one could call an extraordinary."As for how strong a Rare-Tier-9 body is, that friction killer bullet made with the Basic Grade titan iron couldn't even cut a Rare-Tire-9's skin despite its speed. It might only leave a scratch."Those four fellows you killed didn't even have a rare tier-2 body among them, so you could sly them like chickens. They were all at the very bottom of the rare rank."There is a more accurate way to measure physical strength, but you have to look for them yourself. I'm not a strength measuring machine after all, heh."Jacob cocked an eyebrow, but he still accepted this vague assessment, and he got some useful clues as well.Like he was physically as strong as a rare-tier-8 species while common-grade titan iron wasn't enough to kill someone with a rare tier-9 physique, but the speed was still fast enough.Then Jacob asked another important question which was about himself, and deep anticipation shone in Jacob's eyes. "You said any being in rare rank can sense elements and create an element core, then this means I have that too?""Of course you do. But I also mention that the rarer the element, the harder it was to sense it and cultivate it into an element core. Sensing the element is also the hardest part. As for your element, you're on your own."I'm just a book that could lead you to immortality, not toward the path of magic, so don't expect anything from me." Immortika wrote.Jacob merely grunted in exasperation at this, "This much is enough. As long as I have the ability, I'll find a way. Then what about this agelessness of heart? What is this?""It's exactly what it means by those words. Your heart will no longer age ever, and time has no longer effect on it. But don't even think for a second that the other part of your body will not age, or you'll become immortal with just an unaged heart. It's not everlasting!"The moment the hundred years of youthful lifespan end, you'll start aging normally again except your heart, and it could have different consequences on your body." Immortika mockingly replied."Heh, I'm not that delusional. Since I have got everything I want to know, for now, I'll be going if you had nothing to add." Jacob sneered.If it was another time, he would've closed the book after getting his answers before this book could annoy him, but today he has given it a chance to say its piece this time.It was Jacob's way of showing appreciation for the information."Hehehehe, you're not ungrateful after all. So, I'll give a piece of information as a gift for completing the second level and keeping me entertained."Nurture that thrall of yours into a star-level being!"Jacob squinted his eyes and inquired sternly, "You mean Alice? But why?"Although Immortika didn't name the person, he could easily guess who it was directed toward because right now the only thrall he had was Alice since Harrison was dead and he didn't have more, nor he required.This came as a surprise as well, because he was planning on leaving Alice without any prior notice. He no longer required her help anymore and was useless to him.But now he was thinking otherwise since Immortika's words couldn't be taken lightly."Hahahaha… who knows what I said? I've already forgotten. Did you forget I'm bound by…""Fuck off." Jacob instantly closed the book in exasperation before it could repeat the rules bullshit, which clearly wasn't applied to it at all, but it just won't admit.Nevertheless, Jacob no longer plans on leaving Alice behind anymore.He then picked up the things in the cave and stored them all in his newly upgraded infinity pendant. Before, the space was quite limited, so he always had to store small and important things but now it was more than enough to store everything.He could even store a living person inside the pendant. The only things left in the cave were the equipment Jacob no longer needed.Suddenly, a large scanner appeared in Jacob's hand. He still hadn't forgotten about the marked location in this scanner. One location was in the Aureate Kingdom while the other was somewhere on the border river.So, Jacob was first planning on raiding this location before going to find Alice and then leaving this place. The second location would be in his way.Jacob also wore his mask and one of the capes of four skulls, which was made with a special material as well.He was now 6.5 feet tall, and when he tried running at full speed, he blurred, and then he was shocked because he covered 1 mile per second and nearly destroyed everything in his path!'This speed!' Jacob was shocked as he barely managed to stop himself.Furthermore, he noticed that his heart rate was still calm despite his absurd speed.'It seemed there are more details that Immortika didn't mention a rare-tier-8 physique. Like my hearing is now spread into a mile radius, as well as my vision radius. I need to test and then should learn how to control my strength. It'll be easier to trick someone.' Jacob thought with a devious smile on his lips.---Three days later,With a blur, Jacob appeared at the foot of a mountain in the Aureate Kingdom.If not for Jacob learning about his newly advanced body, he would've reached this place within half an hour at his full speed, but he was delayed by three days.But Jacob has learned many things about his new physique, as well as the huge energy consumption that came with it. Even though it was as bad as the hunger of his second level but it was still not something Jacob could ignore.Furthermore, Jacob also discovered that he could control up to 2X acceleration at will. He can enter and exit at will without going through any trouble of meditating.Most of the time Jacob spent was on hunting for meat, and he started to miss titan tears because they were more convenient when it came to energy restoration easily and quickly.But it was a pity the titan iron vein was emptied by the skulls, and his reserve was used.Jacob looked at the scanner in his hand as a red dot was blinking a few meters away from his current position.As he followed the virtual map in the scanner, he finally reached the location, but there was nothing but rocks and a plain rocky surface, nothing else.At this moment, a beep rang on the scanner. "Open the Door of Base NO.2?"Jacob cocked an eyebrow and pressed the open on the screen.The next moment, the rocky surface below Jacob suddenly trembled before a small crack appeared, and it slowly opened inside, revealing an underground passage. A small map also appeared on the scanner at this moment.Jacob's lips curled upward seeing the change. 'Now, this looks more like a dark organization's secret base. This scanner has more function than I think.'With this thought, Jacob entered the passage, which was a stairway toward an underground facility, and as he suspected, with the scanner in his hand, the facility started to lit in lights, and he could see everything clearly. It was a long corridor that led toward a metal door, which was also opened by the scanner, and when Jacob saw what was behind that door, his eyes dilated.There were glass cells filled with hibernation liquid, and inside those glass cells were hideous humanoid monsters sleeping."Mutants!" Jacob instantly recognized them since they weren't much different from the ones he encountered in the lion forest except for their skin color and horns. They look quite similar.Besides those glass cells, there was a working desk, and many files and books were neatly placed on it as well as a small instrument.Jacob smiled coldly, 'So, this is the date that the prick was talking about!'

Chapter 154 Don’t Tell Me…!
﻿After half an hour, Jacob's figure appeared outside the secret underground stairs while holding the scanner in his hand.After exiting the passage, he pressed the scanner's screen a few times before he activated the self-destruction protocol without hesitation.He took whatever he deemed important from this facility, which included the data on cannibals and a jar of titan tears which were clearly saved for the cannibals.Although the effect of Basic Grade Titan Tears almost none exists on Jacob in his current state, it was still better than nothing.As for other things like firearms, Jacob didn't need them anymore, not of common region quality at least.To make things difficult for the killer skull society, he decided to destroy this facility.But he wasn't going to kill those mutants roaming freely in the uncommon region since it would be quite cumbersome, and the more time he wastes here the more danger he'll put himself in.After knowing about the star ranks and extraordinary ranks, he wasn't arrogant enough to think he could fight on equal ground with a dark organization like Killer Skull Society. Who knows just how deep their roots are?After he activated the self-destruction protocol, a five minutes timer appeared, and Jacob stowed away the scanner and left the place without looking back.His next destination was the capital city of Humane Kingdom, where he sent Alice to monitor the movement of royals.As for his reason, it was simply because he didn't want Alice to come with him and Harrison on this venture. She would've only gotten in his way, and Harrison would be suspicious.Jacob's actual plan was to use Harrison to bait A-9999 before absorbing her heart essence and then fetch Alice to use both her and Harrison if he had survived this venture as bait to hunt down those other three skulls in Rainy Mountain Ranges.But the presence of that brain chip made all his schemes in disarray, and all the skulls appeared together.Nevertheless, not only he was able to hunt all of them down, but he even acquired a 1-star core in the process.If not for Immortika's subtle suggestion, he would've left Alice alone since she served no more purpose and only got in his way in the place where he was going.This time, it took Jacob only half a day to reach his destination, which was the territory of Duke Riley!Alice had told Jacob that if he wanted to find her before their impending meeting, she would be in the secret hideout she had created many years ago as a backup if she ever had a falls out with Samuel.Jacob entered a town named Bright Town in the west of Riley Duchy's fief.Since it was already night and Jacob was too fast for anyone to notice him, he easily reached the town lord's mansion, which was the place where Alice should be.The town lord of Bright Town, Yisrael, was an old man and a baron rank noble. He was a trusted aide of Alice, even her father didn't know about it.Yisrael was in his study when an icy voice sounded, nearly giving him a heart attack!"Where is Alice?"Yisrael yelped and nearly fell from his sitting position, and when he saw the cloaked man standing behind him, his old face went pale with fright.How could he not be spooked when this mysterious man appeared in his study without even alerting anyone?However, finding Yisrael was quite easy with Jacob's current hearing, and there weren't many people in there, to begin with, the door wasn't locked either, so Jacob easily found Yisrael with his described appearance.Yisrael's voice trembled as he shouted, "W-who are you? Do… you k-know who… who I am?"Jacob coolly said, "Do you think I care? Where is Alice? I'm here to pick her up, don't waste my time."A hint of astonishment shone in Yisrael's old eyes before he couldn't hear Jacob's words clearly in his shock. Now that he heard Alice's name clearly, he was somewhat at ease.Because if this man was Alice's associate and know about him, then he couldn't be here to assassinate him.Yisrael replied after inhaling deeply, "Sir, if you're looking for young miss, I'm afraid she's not here. I haven't seen her in years. But you should look for her in the tyrant mansion. She worked for Lord Silver Tyrant now."Jacob's eyes narrowed because Yisrael was probably telling the truth. He could easily tell the difference with his heartbeat.'Don't tell me she fled after getting titan tears? Could it be she broke into A-rank with just ten drops and decided she didn't need titan tears anymore and fled this place? Or she was planning this from the start?'A dangerous glint flashed past Jacob's eyes as again asked, "Are you sure she didn't come here?""Y-yes. You can check the secret base in the willow garden. I'm not lying." Yisrael felt his heart palpitate and break into a cold sweat.He didn't know why, but this person was giving him a feeling of death which he never felt from even a B-rank mercenary he met one time.Jacob still doesn't find any lying in Yisrael's voice, even under his faint killing intent, so his conjecture about Alice was probably true. Alice most likely had fled after she deemed there wasn't a need for her to have titan tears.'She might be planning this from the start, but she hid it too well, not like that idiot Harrison. I should've given her the black potion instead of the titan tears like Harrison's as well.'I miscalculated her intentions and let her grow out of hand just to make her powerful cannon fold. But this cannon fold seemed to become a cannon instead. If not for Immortika's suggestion, I won't even bother coming here and then found out about this.'Well, this is what I get for trusting and not enslaving someone with an astute mind. Even if she's hiding in the uncommon region, it would be akin to searching for a needle in the haystack.''Sigh… I would take it as another lesson to not trust a woman again.' Jacob sighed ruefully but a faint smile appeared on his lips the next moment."Alright, I believe you."Before Yisrael could react, Jacob had already vanished from his spot like a phantom, making Yisrael fall on the floor with an appalled look in his eyes, as if he just escaped death.---Somewhere in the Rainy Mountain Ranges,A woman with fairy-like beauty sat in front of a bonfire with an expressionless face as she watched the burning flames in deep thought.It was none other than Alice, who was heading toward the border river to cross into the rare region after she fled the uncommon region. She didn't have an accurate map, so she was still far away from the border river, but not lost, either.She had long planned to flee the uncommon region after she got titan tears from Jacob's hand.Her reasons were simple, first, after she saw those humanoid monsters wreaking havoc in the Aureate Kingdom she knew something was amiss with the uncommon region.Furthermore, the presence of Jacob and other people like him was enough proof that people like her were mere cannon folds and ants in their eyes.Second, she would never accept subjugation and wanted to be one who subjugates others.She knew Jacob was using her, and once she served her purpose, he might discard her despite showing consideration toward her.She never believed for a second that just because of their physical intimacy, Jacob would consider her anything but equal. As long as she didn't have power equivalent to Jacob, he would never think of her as an equal, and she would always be a tramp in his eyes.So, she decided to make an escape while she had the chance. She knew the people behind those monsters and Jacob might be scheming against each other, and she would be the first one to die at that time.Alice had already made preparation before she reported the situation of the Aureate Kingdom to Jacob. If he sent her on another such mission or somewhere else, she would've escaped no matter what.Her entire plan would've been destroyed if Jacob hadn't sent her on another mission, but the temptation of titan tears was too great for her to take such a risk. In the end, her gamble paid off.Although, she was still some distance away from being an A-rank despite consuming those ten drops of titan tears, but she was not far away.She was confident in crossing the uncommon region and border river, which was a dream of hers.However, even after she escaped Jacob's clutches and a new adventure awaits here in the rare region, she felt empty for some reason while being all alone in this vast wilderness.She always thought about her time with Jacob and how he appeared in her life like a storm.Suddenly Alice's cherry lips curled upward into a mesmerizing smile as she mumbled coldly, "Next time, I'll subjugate you, Jacob Steve, just you wait!"

Chapter 155 Black Ship
﻿After getting disappointed in the Humane Kingdom, Jacob didn't stay for long and left toward the border river. He was going to check the second hideout in the scanner before he ventured on his journey toward the Rare Plains.The path led toward the Rare Plains was quite far from the Common Plains.These two places were separated by an ocean called the Star Ocean and the border river was the only source that connected with the Star Ocean in the Common Plains.However, the border river is also known as the Common River. It was also quite huge as it runs all over the common plains, and finding a correct pathway that directly led toward the Star Ocean was easier said than done.The Common River not only connect with the Star Ocean but also led to the Rarer Region and even Epic Region if someone was daring enough to start that voyage.However, without a map, one would only be wasting time and might even end up back where they started.But just the boats needed to travel in the common river and enter the higher region were quite hard to make much less a boat that could travel in the star ocean which was filled with beasts.Not only does one needed resources, but also subsequent strength to travel toward higher regions much less crossing the star ocean.That's why Jacob was hoping to find these skulls' means of transport which was probably quite fast since they could cover years of distance in months.After he saw the map and some details on the star network about the star ocean, he knew just how difficult and dangerous it was to travel in the star ocean especially crossing two plains.Because there was a strange gray fog between the border of two plains which the natives called the 'Despair Fog'.This fog wasn't poisonous but it affects others' six senses, and the strange thing about it was the stronger a person is the greater this fog will affect their senses.Navigating in the despair fog was almost impossible without special equipment. It spreads over miles, and there was no way around it if someone wanted to cross the boundary between plains.That was also the reason very seldom someone tried to enter the common plains, it simply wasn't worth it.As for the common plains, they were even more miserable since it was most difficult for them to cross into the rare plains.When Jacob got all this information and the map, he was quite worried about how he would be going to cross to the other side. It was then that he thought about how these skulls were to keep coming here without any problem.So, all he had to do was to find their means of transport which should be in the uncommon region because they should've come straight here without making any stop.But if he didn't find any means to transport in this hideout as well, then he would have no choice but to go toward the epic region first and build a ship himself.Or he could just wait around the common rive until the reinforcement of the killer skull society arrives and then snatch their means of transport. It would naturally make the Killer Skull Society's leader hate him to the core, but he knew this time there might not be just a 1-star being present, they might even send an extraordinary so wasn't willing to take this risk.Nevertheless, Jacob was quite confident in this second hideout which was close to the common river.Following the safe and short route, it took Jacob a mere week to cross the rainy mountain ranges this time, and if he didn't need to stop occasionally, the time would've been much shorter.Afterward, Jacob just needed to follow the scanner's direction which was a few miles away from the dark city and deep within the forest.Jacob finally stopped in the middle of nowhere, this place was surrounded by trees like any other part of the forest, no one would even think that there was a hidden hideout underneath.Just like last time, the scanner was the key to open this place and the same function activate the moment Jacob came inside its range.Although he didn't know how they made these hideouts or they were here, to begin with, he didn't think much about it since they were no use to him after he left this place.After he unlocked the door which also led to an underground passage but unlike the last hideout, it wasn't a spacious lab but a warehouse!When the light was up, Jacob was astonished when he saw high-tech firearms, gears, scopes, and cold weapons, there were even those red liquid explosives as well as a blue color one.Half of the warehouse was filled with weapons, and on the other side was something that made Jacob's smile widen.There was a small black ship without sails!Jacob couldn't help but exclaimed, "Jackpot!"He quickly approached the black ship which didn't have any sails, it looked completely ordinary.The interior of this ship was also quite plain, there was a large ship cabin separated into two floors.Jacob headed toward the upper floor which was clearly the control room of this ship, and when he saw a large screen and a black screen panel below the screen he knew this wasn't a typical ship.Curious, he tried to turn the black screen panel below the large screen, and the moment he touched it, the panel lit up before a string of words appeared."Star Watch serious above A-10 model required to activate Black Ship AEER-9322"Jacob cocked an eyebrow, 'So, even if someone found this hideout and this ship they won't be able to use it without a high-tech Star Watch. It also means this ship is not ordinary.'The next moment, a black star watch appeared on Jacob's wrist, and the promotion changed on the panel."Star Watch Model A-11 has been detected!""Connecting with Star Watch…"Jacob's Star Watch also lit up as a promotion appeared that this ship was trying to connect with it, and after he gave the confirmation the panel suddenly changed, and many functions appeared.A new black color ship icon also appeared on his watch.Jacob first saw there was a power meter on the side which was still 75% filled. Then there was the control panel, but what drew Jacob's attention was the Map of Routes.When he activated it, the big screen above was also activated, and an already installed map with a route appeared.Jacob's eyes narrowed when he saw the route of this map, and quickly opened the map he was given by A-9999.After studying it carefully, 'They're the same!'Jacob's eyes went cold, from the start, he suspected that these map routes were probably wrong, but he never thought they were not wrong but trap!If he had followed this mapped route, he would've bumped into A-995's party, and it would be game over for him.Jacob then sneered, and after searching in the map menu of the black ship, he found the option to reinstall a new map and route. He could even navigate remotely, but he wasn't an idiot.All he had to do was to open that black ship app on his watch and then install a new map in his watch which he already had bought from the star network.Then Jacob accustoms himself to the controls of the black ship, he wasn't planning on leaving unless he knew this boat was completely safe.What worried Jacob the most was which power this ship ran, and he was astonished when he found it ran on batteries and they could be charged on their own while moving on water.It made Jacob again reevaluate the foundation of Killer Skull Society, and his urge to leave became even more hurried.It took him half an hour to master everything on the black ship, and now he just needed to take it into the water, and he would be ready to sail!Jacob also doesn't forget about all those weapons and equipment in the warehouse.He changed into a new black gear and changed every weapon he deemed useless with the new ones and stored them into his pendant while the ones with less use to him, were loaded all in the ship which had more than enough space.They were probably shipped here in the same way as well.When Jacob was done emptying the warehouse. He tried picking up the black ship which was probably over two hundred tonnes, and he succeeded!Jacob again has a deeper understanding of his strength and just how scary a rare-tier-8 physical strength was.Thereupon, Jacob put the black ship inside the raging common river, but the water current didn't affect it at all since it had already been activated.Jacob was content with this ship, and without any hesitation, he embarked on it.He looked at the uncommon region with a reminisced look and mumbled with a faint smile, "Live life with no excuses, travel with no regret!"_________End of First Volume: A Delightful Curse!

Chapter 156 Arrival Of…
﻿Months after Jacob's departure,Dark clouds covered the bright sky, and rain was pouring down in the Rainy Mountain Ranges, a typical day in the rainy mountain ranges.'Tap… tap… tap…'At this moment, a slim figure wearing a tight black outfit and cape stepped out of the deep forest and looked at the sizeable raging river a few hundred meters away with its emerald eyes filled with ecstasy and glee."I finally made it to the famous border river between uncommon and rare regions, and alone at that." A melodious voice rang behind the cape, filled with elation.This person was none other than Alice who had finally crossed the rainy mountain ranges and reached the border river!'How should I cross this river, though? The water flow is too strong for me. Should I wait for the rain to stop, and this water flow might slow down, or there's another way?' Alice mused as she looked at the raging river.However, before she could investigate further, "Oh, a native. Our luck is not bad." a jeering voice sounded, making Alice's heart palpitate.But before she could even react, a cloaked person appeared in front of her like a phantom, and she felt an appalling strange pressure on her and couldn't move from her place at all.Furthermore, when she saw the size of this person, she felt despair. This person was over five-meter-tall, giving the feeling of a mountain. The pressure coming from this giant was so massive that she couldn't even breathe properly.Thereafter, more cloaked figures started to appear around her, which made the air suffocate to the extreme as all of them were emitting horrendous pressures.As a result, Alice fell on her knees while panting heavily for air, as if she was choking."Alright No.42 and others, stopped throwing your Mana pressure on him, or we won't even have the chance to ask anything before you killed him." A powerful voice rang, filled with authority."Tsk, tsk, and here I thought we caught that troublemaker escaping. It's just an ant." A disdainful voice chuckled.Alice suddenly felt like all that mountainous pressure vanished, and she could finally breathe while coughing.'Who are these people?! They're even stronger than him! Am I going to die? Why… why… I have to die before I get the chance to prove myself… to… to take my revenge on… him…' Myriad thoughts started to rage in Alice's head."Heh, he's going into a post-traumatic shock. What a week shit." One of them sneered disdainfully before he kicked Alice right into the stomach and sent her flying like a rag doll."Now, now, don't break him before we got our answer. No.23, go do your stuff." The same powerful voice commanded again with a hint of contempt.At this moment, a 5 feet tall cloaked figure moved toward Alice who was laying in mud while blood was dripping from her cape as the rain continued to fall.The mysterious figure, No.23, didn't tarry and suddenly pointed his gray sharp finger toward Alice's head.The very next moment, thereafter, the finger shimmered in gray sheen before the nail on the finger expand, turning into a sharp pin, piercing into Alice's head!The sharp nail shone in gray sheen as a childish voice sounded from No.23, "He's under my hypnosis completely, captain, you can ask anything.""Good girl." A tall, burly figure walked over as he patted No.23's head.Then he turned his head toward Alice and coolly asked, "What are your name and species?"While laying in the mud, Alice's eyes were completely listless as she opened her mouth and reply like a puppet without caring about blood or anything."My name is Alice Riley, and I'm a human.""Human? Aren't they the livestock we are rising?" The captain sounded astonished. He asked, "What were you doing here?""Going into Rare Region." She replied."Why?""Because I want to become strong.""Why?""To prove myself.""Oh? To whom?""Jacob Steve.""Who is Jacob Steve? Is he also a human and stronger than you?""He is Silver Tyrant. Yes, he is human and much stronger than me.""Hehe, interesting. Her power is at the top tier in this region so this person is stronger than her, then this means he's probably a hidden expert, and by her answer, she didn't know his background at all." The captain stated."Do you know who is Faceless Ancient?" He questioned."No.""Then do you know about the Killer Skull Society?""No."At this moment, the giant, No.42, spoke in his deafening voice, "Captain, this native is useless. Can I eat him?""Well, it seemed like it. We should found start with this Jacob Steve next. We needed to clear all the variables this time before searching for this faceless ancient."But I don't think he's here anymore since the warehouse is empty, so he most probably fled long before our arrival."There shouldn't be any problem, even if the problem arrives or this Faceless Ancient is scheming again." The capital's voice turned icy cold as the falling rain above his head turned into steam. "Everything is meaningless against absolute power!"Just as his voice trailed off, "Hehe, you got that right. Everything is meaningless against absolute power!" A powerful voice reverberated in the vicinity, startling the skulls!"Who?!" The Captain's voice rang in the vicinity as his aura spiked, and the others went on high alert as well."Hehehe, I never thought the Killer Skull Society will send an Extraordinary in this barren place. You must be ranked within the top Ten in A-ranking skulls, right?" The voice mockingly asked."Coward, show yourself, and I'll tell you!" The captain roared as a fire burned on his body!"Hahahaha… I know you… you are Skull No.07 the Fire Fiend, who massacred eight cities and had a 10 billion bounty on your head. Not bad, not bad. You guys are really up to no good here."But it's pity I couldn't claim your bounty or any of you as a matter of fact, since I can't leave any proof behind. Don't blink or you won't even know how you died." The voice warned as if it was going to act."Hahaha, what an arrogant coward. Let's see how you kill us!" The giant laughed manically, making the surroundings tremble.However, none of these skulls noticed that Alice's body had already vanished from her spot!Every skull entered its battle stance while shimmering in a strange light."Hahaha, good, very good. Ignorance sure is bliss." The voice guffawed as if he was watching a clown show."Let me broaden your horizon before you all died." The voice turned icy at this moment. "??? Spell, Ice Domain!"Fire Fiend's crimson eyes suddenly widened when he heard the name, and he hollered at the top of his lungs, "Run, you idiots, this person is a…!""Too late…" the voice taunted.Thereafter, strange cold energy flowed in the air before the raindrops suddenly turned into ice drops before everything froze turning into ice at an alarming rate. All those skulls didn't even get the chance to know what happened as they all crystallized into ice sculptures.Even the fire around Fire Fiend couldn't stop this strange freezing, and he became an ice sculpture like the others.This strange freezing process not only affect them but the surroundings as well before it spread all the way into the common river, freezing it as well!Over two miles of the area turned into an ice field before it stopped expanding, and it took only ten seconds!The rain also started pouring normally at this moment.At this point, footsteps sounded on the other side of the ice field, and a few figures in long robes and masks appeared as they walked on the frozen surface of the common river.A person in the front was holding a white sword that looked like it was carved with crystal. This crystal sword was shimmering in a blue sheen at this moment.They all crossed the border river and approached those ice sculptures of the skulls.At this time, another figure wearing the same robes as these mysterious newcomers appeared. Still, this person was holding a body over its shoulder, which was none other than the unconscious Alice!The person holding the crystal sword's voice sounded. "How's the girl?"The other person replied, "Fine, my lord.""Good job. Heal her. She's a special one. I never thought we would find someone like her in this barren place. Our trip wasn't a complete waste." He chuckled happily."What about those skulls? It seemed they were really up to something here, or a person like Fire Fiend would never show up in this place." The person holding Alice questioned. It was a woman's voice.The person holding the sword coldly chuckled as he looked at those ice sculptures, "Heh, they would be wonderful evidence to put all the blame on the Killer Skull Society. They could only blame themselves for targeting someone they shouldn't have."His voice turned stern at this moment. "Heed my orders, start the migration, and be ready for the extermination. I want everything done in a month!"

Chapter 157 The Eastern Star Ocean Of Rare Plains
﻿Far away from the Uncommon Region, a black ship was floating on the calm surface of the water under the bright light of the sun.Surrounding this black ship was a vast body of blue ocean, and as far as eyes could see, there was nothing but water.Suddenly, ripples started to appear on the calm water's surface, as if something was coming out.'Splash…'A silhouette shoots out from the water before it landed on the black ship deck.This person was wearing a tight black diving suit and was 6.5 feet tall. His face was exposed as he was extremely handsome with pale white skin, sharp amber eyes, and a chiseled jawline.He had a masculine build like an athlete, and the most eye-catching thing about him was his long silver hair and sword-like silver eyebrows. Who could it be but Jacob?Jacob threw three feet long fish with a long black horn on its head, onto the deck as it was already killed by him."I might go sick eating this Horn Fish regularly. Just where the fuck is that despair mist? I should've reached there a month ago but here I am still wandering in this place. I wonder if this map is even accurate or not." Jacob mumbled with a sharp look on his face.It had been over 10 months since he started his voyage toward the Rare Plains, but after he entered the star ocean and left the common plains, he just kept moving forward without knowing where he was.He just had a virtual map to navigate, and he had more than one, so it was impossible for all of them to be wrong, but for some reason, the famous despair mist didn't appear according to the map.So, Jacob became restless after an entire month passed, but he didn't dare to change the route on the black ship because this would reset the coordinates, afraid he might lost in this ocean.Not only he didn't encounter any vicious aquatic beasts on his journey, but he even had to hunt for food.However, according to the map and route he was on, he had already entered the Eastern Star Ocean of the rare plains, and in a week, he would reach the shore of the rare plains.Even after searching the star network, he got the same result, and the map was completely accurate so, he guessed that the famous mist was just a hoax or all those maps were.Either way, he knew going back wasn't an option, and he decided to wait for two weeks to see if he reached the shore or not.While on the common plains, he had already experienced and tested the accuracy of the black ship's autopilot and the map again and again, so he knew they were not with any issues.It had something to do with the star ocean, probably.If he really reached the rare plains without encountering the famous despair mist, then he would consider himself lucky and move on.But if he was lost or there was something wrong with the navigation function, then all he could do was get ready for the worse.Anyhow, in these past months, Jacob wasn't just idle. He continued to increase his knowledge about the rare plains and anything that could interest him in the star network.Furthermore, he had more refined control over his strength as well.He could even hunt this Horn Fish, which was a Common-Tier-12 species now, and inside the water at that.Jacob discovered that for some reason, he could move in the water like an agile fish and as he stayed in the water, his speed would increase.He mused that it might have something to do with water meditation, which he hadn't practiced since he left the tyrant mansion, and he won't even think of trying it in this deep ocean unless he wanted to commit suicide.When Jacob was about to gut the Horn Fish, he suddenly turned around, and his eyes widen slightly because he saw a silhouette, a few miles away from the black ship, moving in his direction.'There shouldn't be any ship in this barren part of star ocean which leads toward the common plains, or they're going in the common plains. Well, they could be from the common plains for all I know.'I have no confirmation except that map that I'm on the rare plains. Let's see if they're coming my way and friendly.' Jacob thought before he headed back to gear up.He won't take chances within the star sea; this black ship was even more precious, so the moment he senses hostility from them and they were not as strong as him, he'll act with no hesitation.Soon, the silhouette become clearer as it was coming in the black ship's directionJacob stood on top of the cabin's roof, dressed in black armor and a long jacket covering his equipment. He also wore his black mask and cover his silver hair with a hood.He squinted his eyes when he saw the ship headed his way; it was a medium size battle sail ship colored navy blue, and the sails were painted gray.When his eyes fell on the top where a black flag was swaying with two crossed golden swords' emblem, a glint of astonishment shone in his eyes.Because he had seen that emblem in the books related to the rare plains.Unlike the Common Plains, which were separated by regions and many powers ruled different territories, the Rare Plains were completely different.The Rare Plains weren't completely conquered and explored.The explored area was known as Rare Freedom Plains. Just this explored area alone was ten times bigger than the entire common plains combined!The Rare Freedom Plains were occupied and divided between four powers.The Golden Sword Country, the Light Nation, the Iron Sierras, and the Ice Nation.Also, unlike the common plains, the racial factor in Rare Freedom Plains was almost non-exist, and the only factor that mattered was power and potential!The information on the evolution system of species was deep, and as long as one showed a considerable amount of potential, they could join the ranks of these four powers and gain access to unimaginable resources to which the public had no access.The three hegemonies' influence was also not to be underestimated in rare freedom plains because they all still stand above these four local powers but stay out of any local conflicts.As long as no one provoked them, they won't interfere in other business.On the contrary, the role of the three hegemonies was even more essential for the four powers of Rare Freedom Plains because they all rely on them to nurture experts and gain knowledge, and conquered more lands. One could say the three hegemonies were like experts making factories for these four powers.The Golden Sword Contrary was closest to the Eastern Star Ocean of the Rare Freedom Plains.So, seeing the flag of Golden Sword Country naturally startled Jacob as well, giving him the confirmation he needed that he was indeed in the eastern star ocean.But this also raises the same question: why doesn't he encounter the famous despair mist? Where did it go?He would never believe that he was lucky or someone cleared it for him just so he could pass safely.Nevertheless, since he was already on the rare plains, he no longer cared and focused on the matter at hand.He has to remain cautious about how he deals with Golden Sword Contrary. He didn't want to fall out with local power before he could even reach the destination.This place was far more advanced than the common plains, almost at the level of modern civilization, and experts of peak rare rank ruled this place.Even with Jacob's current strength, he was far from invincible in the rare plains like the common plains, so he didn't want any trouble for himself.Then there was still the Killer Skull Society, which might be searching for him like mad dogs.When the ship of Golden Sword Country was only tens of meters away from Jacob's black ship, a deep voice rang."Stranger, show your Identity Poof, permit of this Ship, and Sailing License. If you have none, then surrender peacefully and accept the detention according to the laws of Golden Sword Country!"Thereafter, the ship cannons were instantly locked on Jacob's black ship. If Jacob resisted they would really shoot him down.Just with these words and movements, Jacob knew this wouldn't end peacefully. He didn't have any of those things they demanded.He wondered if he had taken a route that was under surveillance by following the other map instead of the society's map. It was very possible!Jacob also saw a man in a navy blue uniform walking at the edge of the deck and looked at Jacob coldly.This man was three-meter tall with a burly build and long blond hair. There were strange black symbols tattooed carved on his entire bronze skin face.'A Bigot Barbarian!'

Chapter 158 Exposure And Invitation
﻿'A Bigot Barbarian!'Jacob wasn't ignorant about the species of the Rare Freedom Plains like he once was about the Common Plains.He had remembered every intelligent and local species of Rare Freedom Plains. They were ample information on the star network.He instantly recognized those unique racial features of the Barbarian Race, which were just below the Giants in comparison to their physical strength!The Barbarian Race was born with monstrous strength like Giants but every barbarian was born with strange markings on their bodies that look like tattoos.The Bigot Barbarians were a branch of the Barbarian Race and one of the few intelligent species present in the Rare Freedom Plains. Anyone could recognize them with bronze skin and blond hair, as well as their unusual heights and massive builds.The Bigot Barbarian was a Rare-Tier-6 Species and fell in the category of Fighter type species with over 600-Ton physical strength.From Rare Tiers, there were two different categories of species because not every rare tier species has such physical strength.These two categories, the first one was Fighters who represent pure physical strengthsThe physical strength measuring system for the Rare Fighter Tier Category was in tons.Any species with at least a hundred tons of pure physical strength could be called a Rare-Tier-1 Fighter type species. With every 100+ tons, the tier increased all the way up to the Rare-Tier-9 with over 900 tons of strength.The other categories were known as Wiser, and the strangest thing was there was no information on the Rare Wiser Tier Category at all, but just a name.Jacob instantly guessed that it might have something to do with the elements or magic, Immortika told him about. Because for some reason there wasn't any information on element power, mana, or magic cores on the star network.The only clue he had was this mysterious Wiser species.Anyhow, Jacob can be considered a Rare-Tier-8 Fighter with over 800 tons of strength, and this Bigot Barbarian might not even take a punch from him.A Rare-Tier-8 Fighter was so rare that Jacob had yet to find even one clue on them, or his star network was just too limited.Still, this battleship was not going to be enough to stop him, but he didn't want to turn hostile, or if those over fifty cannons were fired at once, his precious black ship will be blasted into bits.Although this ship also had an energy defensive barrier installed within, Jacob wasn't sure if it was enough to block so many cannons.So, he thought for a moment, before he said while looking at the Bigot Barbarian, who was still waiting for his reply."I'm afraid I have none of those things you want because I'm a Star Oceanographer and Adventurer who likes to study and explore the mysteries of the Star Ocean. I think I wandered into the Golden Swords Country's territory unknowingly."I don't want any trouble, so I'm willing to pay any type of fine for breaking this law, and I'll leave immediately," Jacob stated.There were many star oceanographers out there who like to explore, so his reason wasn't a complete lie.However, the Bigot Barbarian wasn't a fool as he coldly uttered, "I don't care who you are or what your reason is for wandering in Golden Swords Country's territory. Either you accept the detention peacefully, or I'll happily send you permanently inside the ocean and let you explore the ocean forever."Jacob deeply looked at the Bigot Barbarian, who was also staring back at him with cold eyes.Jacob's eyes suddenly become emotionless before he vanished from his spot with a blur under Bigot Barbarian's flabbergasted expression."Where did he go?" He was shocked because he couldn't even see the man's movement at all."I'm here." An icy voice sounded from behind, making Bigot Barbarian startlingly turn around.There were other people in the same navy-blue uniform on the deck as well, and all of them were gobsmacked by how this man appeared on the deck like a ghost."Still want to do this? I don't want any trouble, and we can all be on our way." This time Jacob's words were more like a threat than a persuasion.Since he was already on the other party's ship, he had already decided to kill them all if they still did not back down, even after seeing his capability and continued being ignorant.But killing them might set some kind of alarm, or if they were not returned within a set period of time, more ships might come searching for them. Jacob was still far from the shore so he didn't want to fight with fleets and become an enemy of Golden Swords Country.Since even a scouting or patrolling ship had a Bigot Barbarian instated, then they clearly weren't a pushover."Interesting. A Skull hesitated to kill while he had the chance? You're not from the Killer Skull Society, are you?" At this moment, a mellow aged voice rang from behind Jacob.Jacob's expression turned serious when he heard this voice and looked back.He saw another Bigot Barbarian, but he was 3.4 meters tall and had a wizened face. His blue eyes were without any fear or agitation as he faced Jacob. On the contrary, he seemed to … glad.Jacob instantly felt amiss when he heard the work skull and the old Bigot Barbarian's smile. He didn't know why he said those words or why he wasn't afraid of him, but he sensed no hostility from him.So, he decided to reply, "No, I'm not a Skull if that's what you think."The old Bigot Barbarian's smilingly replied, "Care to explain how that stolen Black Ship by the Killer Skull Society's Earth Slayer came into your possession?"Jacob's heart turned cold when he heard A-995's Star Network's ID, 'They knew, but how?!'The old Bigot Barbarian's smile widened when he noticed some ripples in Jacob's cold eyes. He coolly said, "You're an ascetic expert, right?""Why do you think that?"Jacob had many questions now, and he was feeling on edge because they all knew about the black ship background, and from his old man's tone, he could tell they might be specifically here because of the black ship.Then this also means they came prepared!"Hehe, it's because you're traveling with a stolen good without even knowing it was stolen, which could only mean you're not registered with any Private Star Servers of four powers."Neither you have a permit for that black ship, or you seem to know just how expensive and hard to get that ship from Black Sea Company. Furthermore, you do not know that the Black Sea Company can easily track down that black ship without the help of a stealth guard."A Skull would never make such a rookie mistake. So, that guy met with the misfortune to encounter you." The old Bigot Barbarian explained without hiding anything, and the smile on his face never faded."Lastly, you have prowess above tier-6 fighter and still have no idea what kind of naval force Golden Swords Country had and still dared to resist the detention in the middle of star ocean."Unless you're overly confident that you could swim all the way back, or you're an ascetic or an aboriginal who lived on some island and came all the way here after encountering an idiot skull."And I'm willing to wager that you're the second case because you don't even know that the ID we were asking for was your Star Watch's ID. And I don't believe you didn't have a star watch since that black ship won't work without it."So, tell me Stranger, who are you?" The old Bigot Barbarian questioned again with a smile.Jacob again fell silent because he did not know that there was such a thing, and it also appeared that he was still ignorant about the customs of Rare Freedom Plains.He also got to know the Star Network's importance and why his Private Star Servers were empty. It might be where the true function of the star network lies.But right now, he had to find a way out of this mess because the other party seemed to be quite confident in handling him. The old Bigot Barbarian spoke again as his smile vanished. "Let me suggest something?""What might that be?" Jacob questioned, but was quite interested in this old Bigot Barbarian since he was so calm about the situation and almost told him every flaw he had."As long as you show me your Star Network ID and your Private Star Servers, if it is empty and you're really what I just said you are, I'll let you join the ranks of our Golden Swords Country."We always welcome new experts like you and will not mistreat you. On the contrary, you'll get a huge reward for 'finding' that missing black ship from the Black Sea Company as long as we told them that 'our personal' found it and was just on his way to submit it."From then on, you'll be a member of Golden Swords Country. What do you think?" The Old Bigot Barbarian solemnly expressed!

Chapter 159 Acceptance
﻿Jacob was really astounded by the offer of Old Bigot Barbarian, which was by no way just as trifled as it sounded."May I ask why would you do that? I still have an unknown background, and who knows, I'm really the guy you were looking for and just fooling you. Aren't you afraid of accepting a skull within your ranks?" Jacob questioned. The Old Bigot Barbarian coolly replied, "That's why I want to see your star watch, because if you are a skull, then your Star Network ID would have the infamous Killer Skull Society's skull symbol badge within your personal profile."Which could only be gained after you registered with their private server and you have the strength to enter their private server unless they're blind."Similarly, if you join any servers of three hegemonies, you'll have their symbol badges as well. These badges are like identity proof and could never be removed unless you could hack into the Star Network or get kicked out by the server owner."As for a skull leaving their private star server, it means a certain death. Now you understand why I want to see your star watch and why it is considered identity-proof."Once you registered with our country database, you'll naturally get invited to our private star server, which will grant you the Level-2 Symbol Badge of our country citizen as well."The Old Bigot Barbarian explained patiently, "As for your other identity, as long as you're not an enemy of our country, then we don't care. Since you have strength over tier-6 fighter, we'll welcome you with open arms, and all we ask for in return will be your help whenever needed."'The Star Network Profile as an identity and the badges. It's really just as he said. It is nearly impossible to fool someone if they're not primitive and never came in contact with the star network.'To survive on rare plains, the star network is essential, and no one seemed to doubt that this network could be hacked. Which alone is enough to make this network like an omniscient in everyone's eyes.' Jacob thought without replying to Old Bigot Barbarian.He had to admit that he really required an identity and more information about these private star servers. Joining the ranks of Golden Swords Country was the easiest way, at least until he was ready to be independent again.Or he could just simply trick them and escape after he reached the lands. No one could stop him at that time.But if he wanted to do that, he still needed to show his personal profile, or he had to kill all of them to leave this place with an intact black ship.However, it was the most foolish plan because just as the Old Bigot Barbarian said; he had underestimated the naval forces of the locals and now he could either abandon the ship and swim toward the lands or try picking a fight with him.Both choices led to him being hunted down by the Golden Swords County, at least until he was in the water.Jacob gave a deep look to the Old Bigot Barbarian, who still had that calm, amiable smile. 'What a wily punk,' He sneered inwardly before he nodded. "Alright, I'll agree to join your ranks."Old Bigot Barbarian's smile widened. "Alright, follow me. We'll talk about official business in my cabin. Let those men take care of your belongings and ship."He then shoots a meaningful glance at the Bigot Barbarian behind Jacob, which made the former shudder, and he quickly sprang into action.Jacob didn't mind since there wasn't anything worthy in that ship because anything precious was already in his pendant, so he calmly followed the Old Bigot Barbarian inside."Oh, I forget to introduce myself. I'm Deputy Admiral of Golden Swords Country, Milan Wo Bigot." Milan introduced himself with his rank.Jacob plainly replied, "Just call me Jack, and I have no title."Milan didn't mind as he asked curiously, "So, where did you find that bastard Earth Slayer and where are you from?""First, can you tell me how you know that this ship was on Earth Slayer exactly?" Jacob was confused about this because if the Killer Skull Society stole the Black Ship, then how did they know currently it was in Earth Slayer's hand?'Could it be they had some kind of surveillance function on the ship as well?'However, Jacob vanquished that notion since they were surprised by finding him instead of Earth Slayer, and they were probably hoping to capture him alive since they try to speak first, not shoot on sight.Milan chuckled, "Heh, you might not know, but the Killer Skull Society is made with a bunch of misfits and twisted bastards. They all believed in equality and loath the current civil system."Yet their actions are completely different. They plunder, kill, rape, and destroyed cities for the sake of their foolish cause. Not only that, but they liked to show it off and rub it on everyone who tries to oppose them."His voice turned icy. "They would make video files or take pictures of their glorious deeds and then post them in Star Network News. Your watch didn't have that Star Network News feature in your star network, right?"Jacob grimaced and nodded, "Indeed.""Don't worry, as long as you complete the final verification with the Destiny Star Corporation, it will appear on its own, and then you'll get all the news related to the Rare Freedom Plains."Anyhow, I was briefing you about how we know this ship was with Earth Slayer of Killer Skull Society."Over two years ago, a shipment of twelve black ships was heading toward the Ice Nation, but it was intercepted by a bunch of skulls. Then, like before, they posted this news with great pride on the Star Network News and the names of skulls who were involved in this."Jacob was speechless by this and couldn't help but asked, "Aren't they afraid they would get caught by doing this kind of foolish action? I mean, aren't a dark organization like killer skull society would be more secretive about their member's details and what they do?""That's the thing, Jack. They do this to promote their organization and draw more hot-blooded youths or some poor souls who were once mistreated by the system or simply didn't want to follow it or the rules."While it is almost impossible to track them down because the Star Network is very strict with its freedom policies and privacy of their users, and it is completely flawless."So, organizations like the Killer Skull Society could use it openly to recruit more skulls and multiply their numbers. Even though the star network is helpful for our civilization and bought revolutionary changes, but nothing is without consequences."Nevertheless, we could only blame ourselves for being so weak that we couldn't influence the likes of Destiny Star Corporation. Ah, I'm being sentimental again and drifted from the main topic." Milan smiled wryly with a hint of lamentation."The Black Ship AEER-9322 you were using appeared over a year ago when the Earth Slayer posted a picture of him driving it in the star ocean and taunting the authorities to not be able to capture them."Earth Slayer was quite infamous for assassinating many influential figures, so his ID was a black ID in our database. Every news regarding him was a top priority."When the Black Sea Company alerted us about the ship signal being found in this area in the morning, they naturally sent me to make sure of capturing that prick alive or at least bring back his corpse," Milan revealed.At this time, they finally reached a cabin and entered. It was far more spacious than Jacob's and more lavish.After they sat down, Milan continued, "But instead of that bastard Earth Slayer, I met you, and it was a good call to not bombard the ship when I saw you standing on top of the ship. Or I'm afraid we all have been dead already, right?"Jacob merely responded, "I would indeed kill anyone who would try to kill me, and that Earth Slayer was the same case."I was living in an isle for many years far away from this place, and that fellow happened to be testing his firearms on that isle, and that's how I came in the possession of that ship and this Star Watch."But I won't lie to you by saying that I was unaware of the rare plains' existence. It's just that I have no means to travel here with all those dangers in the star ocean. However, I took the chance presented, and this is all I have to say about my background." Jacob made some hoax story that sounded somewhat absurd but still in the realm of reality.As for how he got there or what he was doing there, it's on them to figure it out, and he could tell they might really not care as long as his slate was clean!

Chapter 160 Golden Swords Country (1)
﻿Milan merely gave Jacob a meaningful glance before he nodded smilingly, "As I said before, as long as your star watch profile is clear, your background doesn't matter. Now, if you please show me your star watch so I could report this to higher-ups."Jacob thought for a moment before he slid his sleeve and revealed the black star watch in front of Milan and opened his personal profile.Milan watched without blinking. He knew more than Jacob about star watches, and with just a glance, he could guess that Jacob might not be a newbie to star watches as he thought.Furthermore, he wanted to see Jacob's profile from his star watch because those identity badges would only show if someone showed them on their profile, and one could even decide on a specific badge to scan through their identity check as long as it's valid they didn't need to show more identity proof.That's also how the skulls breach passed the identity check, and there wasn't any policy to make them show their star watches as long as there wasn't any felony on their username.Because the identity scanners were from the Destiny Star Corporation, which was part of the Star Network as well, and as long as a user wasn't a criminal in their database, the star network scanner would never reveal their personal information, even usernames.It would only give an 'Approved' sign after a scan and that was enough to bypass any city gates.As for stopping using the star network for identity scanning, it was night impossible because there was an even bigger threat than the skulls in the rare plains, and the star network was the only thing that could make sure that threat won't become a killing blade.Moreover, anyone who had tried to make their own personal security system had failed miserably and always got hacked by misfits like the Killer Skull Society or the threat.So, these four powers had no other choice but to accept the star network profiles as their identities.As for making someone a criminal under the star network's UI was even more difficult than searching for them because the star network would only make those criminals who break the Star Network laws, not the laws of some natives.So, those four powers had no way to know who was who without them showing their profile willingly, and even then, it was quite hard to find the criminals because many applications could show a fake profile, and the others would have no way to verify it without star network revealing it.However, getting one's hands on such applications was also difficult because anything related to the Star Network was handled by the Destiny Star Corporations and their employees would seldom help developed such applications in the dark or if caught, it would be over for them.Nevertheless, these kinds of applications were still existing and could be bought as long as people know where to look for them and have the right amount of money.However, Jacob still had little knowledge about the star network and the loopholes in the network.Even if he searched the Star Information Sea, he won't be able to find any information if he tried writing 'Star Network Hacks', 'Star Network Loopholes, or any word that was related to star network privacy and threatened it would never appear in Star Information Sea because the network would never approve it.However, Jacob would not care even if he knew about the loopholes, not for now because he really had nothing to hide except he was from the common plains.But when he saw how calmly Milan reacted when he glanced at his profile, this confirmed his guess that they might really not care about his background but his prowess only.When Milan saw there wasn't any kind of badge below Jacob's username or profile name, he had already seen all the basic applications on Jacob's star watch, so he knew it was a real profile.So, he didn't have him scroll down to see his species or age and merely nodded with a friendly smile, "Alright, you can close it. Since you do not belong to any power, there's no need to suspect you anymore."This is also proof of what I said earlier. We welcome experts like you with open arms and only required your assistance if needed. As long as you have the identity of the country's citizen, we won't care about your race or background."The Golden Swords Country is much laxer in this department of species, and many races live together in harmony. Because even if your race is titled as Rare-Tier-9, it doesn't mean every member of that race will reach tier-9 or remain at tier-9."The ranks and grades are just set for those who wanted to look superior because of their ancestors' achievements. Just like us Bigot Barbarians, who are considered a Rare-Tier-6 fighter type species, but it's been over a hundred years since we have an actual Rare-Tier-6 clansman."So, don't worry about anything. As long as you are strong, everyone will revere you whether you're from the goblin race or those arrogant elves or giants. Everyone knew better not to mess with a Rare-Tier-7 or above rank fighter." Milan candidly revealed with no shame when he talks about his own species' shortcomings.Jacob felt that this old man was too open-minded, but he also agreed with his view because he had seen himself that the limits were something people set on themselves.He nodded before his voice turned stern. "Alright, as long as the Golden Swords Country won't show hostility, I won't either. So, care to explain what I need to do to join your ranks and what will be my position and where?"You and I both know that I won't be appointed to some general rank or some important rank from the get-go. So just tell me the truth now. I don't want any misunderstanding later."Milan merely smiled, "You're a sharp one indeed, but you should know I'm not in the position where I could appoint you as I wish, and even if could I won't because everyone has to earn their spot or those who work hard for it won't be able to accept it."I'll vouch for your identity, and afterward the country assembly will be decided where to appoint you and in which position. But don't worry, because of your prowess, they won't dare to try something funny and make you unhappy."You just have to work for a year or two before you might reach my rank or even higher if you know your way around. By doing this, everyone would be satisfied, and you'll earn far more than you could imagine."'So, I still have to work for them until they let me have a high-ranking position? This will also make me a target of some people who don't want to let a cannon loose and like to keep it under control.'However, they didn't know my actual capacity. I could use them instated to fill my knowledge gap and acquire information on Wiser species and element cores. The rare freedom plains are just part of the rare plains, and I could leave anytime.' Jacob thought deeply before he nodded in agreement to Milan's words.Even if he hadn't encountered Milan, he was already planning to join one of the three hegemonies after testing the waters of the Rare Freedom Plains.But this unexpected turn of events wasn't as bad as he thinks, and he wasn't someone who would be swayed by power, fame, or riches. As long as it was necessary to reach his goal, he was willing to do anything.He had already decided to get the information on some alternative names he heard from Milan, like the Destiny Star Corporation, which was related to the star watches and star network. There was also some kind of verification he lacked.Lastly, his goal was to find information on Star Ranks and Extraordinary Species' existence. But foremost, he needed to get off this damn ocean with no hitch!"Alright, I hope what you said was not just your words." Jacob coldly uttered.Milan nodded solemnly. "Don't worry, we Bigot Barbarians are not despicable and always keep our word. Let me arrange a room for you. We'll reach the shore in half a day by following the navy route, and this ship is far faster than that black ship."Jacob agreed with Milan's arrangement and he never asked him to reveal his face all this time, which was also quite unusual, but good for Jacob. So, he left Milan's room with a soldier who escorted him to his room.Milan's amiable smile vanished when Jacob left the cabin as his old face turned emotionless. He then unexpectedly spoke, "So, what do you think... Admiral?"A mild voice with a hint of indifference rang from the shadowy corner of the cabin. "Just some arrogant clod who didn't know the immensity of Rare Freedom Plains!"
